Great device was able to side load apps cause the system is android based.
Very good item, very happy with it, will buy again
Works great! My echo answers all my questions. Very happy I purchased it!
Bought this as a gift. My kids and I have these at home and love them. My cousin loves it as much as we do.
Bought my husband this for Father's Day and he loves it! We even went back to get the smaller version for another area of our home and another for my father. I wish this hooked up to other Bluetooth items like the dot does
Me and my wife used the fire stick to stream shows for over a year and recently upgraded our internet to a higher speed package. To take advantage of the new speeds I thought I'd get the fire TV to use the Ethernet port on the back. Not only does it stream the shows much faster and HD works much better now, but just clicking through the menus is so much nicer with no hesitation. If you are on the fence go with the fire tv and save yourself the upgrade later. Definitely worth it.
Good value for the price. Little bit heavy to carry.
easy to use - easy to hold while reading lighter than my first kindell
Great box I like all the features for itHighly recomend
I just wanted to be able to just read a book. Really very happy.
Works great as I would expect it too. Only complaint, why is this not just part of the kindle purchase instead of a separate line item.
Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
Mom really love it for Christmas. Easy for her to use.
Love, love, love it! I check all news, weather forecast, listen to music, listen to newspaper/ magazine reviews, buy stuff etc. How did I live without Alexa /Echo?
This is a very affordable tablet for a kid just bought a case online. And it's perfect for taking it around.
It was a great purchase for my grandson. He enjoys the tablet and it seems to be easy for him to use.
It was great for my 73 year old mother.She uses it for the Bible.
My daughters love to use their Fire, work well with the WiFi.
Not too satisfied with the sound and it loses Bluetooth connection no matter what phone I use (either Iphone or Android).
For little more money than the firestick, you will get lan hard connection as well as wireless and 4k compatibility. Also provides faster processor for load times.
So far we use it for entertainment and it has not disappointed! We have found every genre of music and many obscure musicians with it. Have some privacy concerns, but overall for music and jokes, it is fun! My wife has discovered new songs, due to an occasional misinterpretation, but always fun enjoy. Great for waking us up also!
Buy this Amazon box and side load Kodi - so you can get free tv , box office movies and more ... Google Kodi and watch a video
Easy to use and set up! Package and arrival as great through Best Buy!
I love everything about my fire tv. I wish I wouldve gotten one sooner!
Echo is really a lot of fun. We use it constantly, to play music we like, for shopping and to do lists and to get answers to quick questions instantly. Really a worthwhile purchase!
Both my husband and I like to refer to Alexa for information. My husband especially likes to have her set the morning alarm. He is constantly asking Alexa to set a timer.
thin and excellent design!most of all, the Amazon fire price was good for thanksgiving gifts.Kids and Youth liked very much!
I would recommend this product to anyone on a budget or who wants something bigger than an Iphone for searching purposes. It does everything my Iphone does. But I wanted a tablet for reading, spotify, netflix, and just the ease of a bigger screen. $40 Bucks why not!?
Made my sisters sons Christmas! Priced right and as expected a very solid performing tablet, thanks again Best Buy!
This has become the go to source for our family. We placed it in the kitchen and whether we want to know the news, the weather, a joke or just to listen to music this device has not let us down. We are just now starting to buy adapters to allow the device to control lights. All with the sound of your voice. Very cool!!
Easy to use, light weight, fits in a small purse or bag.
Simple tablet that does what it is supposed to do. Don't be too worried about the 8 gig memory, you can use a memory card to upgrade
Best purchase you will ever make. Intall kodi and go cable free
We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.
I love having Alexa around. When you have your hands full you can still get information or set a timer without having to empty your hands or wash the meatloaf off first. I can't wait to see what all she can do.
I already had two DOTS (one connected to my main stereo via the aux line), but I wanted a stand alone Alexa device for a large bathroom suite. No real complaints other than value. I think this should be more like a $129-139 device. The speaker quality is pretty good but I expected something closer to a high end stand alone bluetooth speaker for $179. Still, I don't regret the purchase and I would make it again. One other factor that didn't affect the way I am using it....unlike the DOTS...the ECHO cannot be used with earbuds because it does not have bluethooth sending capabilities.
bought for my grand baby for christmas....haven't opened it yet but the other reviews were great!.....i'' sure he'll love it!!....
Works great with my harmony remote, but she is not very smart. Siri works better for most items.
Great tablet and pretty easy to set up , front and back camera and good resolution I just love my tablet
Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts' content. They ar ed really fast too.
This tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!
This is not only fun to use but extremely handy to have around the house.
Perfect tablet for the avid reader. Great functions light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet. Easy to use and fits perfectly in hand and not too heavy for one handed use.
Picked up this tablet for my kid, the price was very appealing. My kid loves the tablet, does everything a more expensive table to would do.
Bought it as a xmas gift for my daughter who doesn't read too much and now with the purchase of Amazon Kindle she's reading more.. plus she gets to play android games.
I bought 2 of these as gifts for my nephews. They loved having their own tablets. Great price. Highly recommend!
I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
Had a kids fire and switched to this with a kids case and tempered glass this time works really well for kids
Great basic tablet for the money! Great for reading and surfing the web, only complaint is glare in bright sunlight.
I bought 2 for each of my children and they love it.
the Kindle paperwhite is an amazing reader. the battery last for what seems like forever and the clarity of the screen is perfect. The product is also very thin and light, making it easy to take wherever.
My daughter loves it. So easy to set up. And keeps everything age appropriate.
Works great, the talking assistant is a great novelty although I personally don't use it that much. HD clarity is fantastic on a 4K TV. Highly recommended if not using on a smart tv, which can already connect to Amazon by itself. Although the HD is actually better through the external device
Bought this instead of getting another roku ultra that was giving me problems. This has a guide that roku doesn't and it shows you have a new recording if you have it in my shows
Echo is like having your own personal assistant. It's a blast to wake up every morning and finding out how traffic is and what the weather forecast looks like.
So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
This device is kid friendly and is amazing for kids that don't like to read.
I love it , great hd movies and to install programs to watch online.
I love this product and my kids use it everyday to watch movies and serials.
Perfect size for travel. Holds a lot of books, easy to download to.
Purchased it for my son. He loves it and it is easy to use. Great deal too!
I'm an apple guy, but got this tablet because I'm a prime member and the price was right. Works fine, but I think the iPad is easier to use.
I got this for my wife and she loves it. She is old school and likes her toggle buttons on the old one. However, she likes being able to read anywhere at anytime. The back light is not over powerful. I was happy to hear this because I wasn't sure if I should have got the one that auto detects ambient light.
Well made and profrssional looking. Operating manual clear and complete.
Love the fire tv. Easy to set up and easy to use. Great quality content and streaming
I purchased an ASUS 2 in 1. I love it. It was so much easier to switch all my documents and load programs from my other PC. The only problem I had was the facial recognition. It kept saying it did not recognize me and got locked up. Customer Service was very nice and got me going again.
It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.
Good sound and very intuitive. Ask for an artist and voila! It's there. Haven't connected Bluetooth bulbs or outlets yet but plan on in the future
I have the first version, and I can't wait to see my son face when he gets for Christmas
I bought this for my daughter. I like it all in all. I was unaware that it didn't have a google to do internet searching.
I eventually had to return it because of the shades of yellow in the back-light when using it at night. It was okay at day time but at night during which I usually read it was not what i expected to be premium cost product. Especially it was very annoying to read in the landscape mode. I guess Amazon needs a better QA department.
Love it... is really nice product, and not expensive.
This is the third Kindle I have purchased (not counting a Kindle Fire). I love the paper white. It is so easy on older eyes and the adjustable font size and brightness make reading a Kindle easier than a book . The screen is crystal clear whether in bright sunlight or in the dark. It is light weight which (like with older eyes) makes it easier for older hands to hold. I download a lot of library e books and can carry unlimited reading materials with me in a compact package. I would recommend this product to anyone who reads.
Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it.
I love my Echo. You can ask it most everything and get an answer. Plays music with great sound!
I used it as a gift in an office holiday secret Santa
Works well and easy to use. This is a great Camera for the price
the item is good but keep frozen I need some advice
This product works great and you can speak right to the remote of what you want
Great for intertainment very good device effective better than cable Tv
The whole reason for getting a Fire stick was to download Kodi TV and additional addons to get streaming movies and TV. I also have a Fire TV for the largest TV in the house, which is faster. Now that it is up and running, I am going to cancel my cable TV and just keep the internet service.
I have to admit I actually like this thing. I wish it would browse things on the internet a little more but oh well
This is an ideal unit to use when cutting the cable from your provider. Very easy to install and there are great YouTube videos to get even more out of the unit.
Product does not disappoint. It does what it says.
I love the Kindle Paperwhite as I can read it indoors and outdoors with no glare issues. I'm able to download books as needed very quickly. Keeps me updated in my reading library.
Probably the best priced tablet on the market. Works well.
This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.
I use the email, search, and read books primarily. My fingertips are still clumsy on the keyboard but will improve! I forget how to access some things but ask those who know. The Kindle Fire can do so many things for the modest price. I just need to keep at it!
Bought this for my mom as a gift and she loves it. Much easier than buying paper books
Works great, good sound quality, easy and fun to use.
I purchased this to watch movies and such on a led tv that doesn't have smart features built in and because of the ability to side load apps. Just an added bonus you can pair bluetooth headphones to the fire tv but not the stick
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Best tablet for the money.
Amazon tablet is great to have. Now I wish I bought more gb.
WORKS GREAT BUT NEEDS SOME WORK WITH UPDATES TO UNDERSTAND YOU AND GIVE MORE ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.
Easy to setup and use connects to Wi Fi and streams flawlessly. There are a lot of free channels to stream. Great product that can do so much. I highly recommend this product for the diehard that is into steaming TV from the internet.
It's silly these aren't provided with the purchase of a Kindle. Super expensive.
Amazon Fire TV is the best ever I have it' is good
This is a great way to get rid of that monthly cable bill!
Love this tablet, everything is excellent for the price except no google play store. I am not a fan of subpar apps, takes Amazon's outdated Facebook app. Accept Google Play and I will rate 5 stars.
The firestick tv is awesome and easy to use its also small
This is a great streaming device. Easy to use and user friendly. It says it plays 4K which is a plus. I've streamed Amazon and ps Vue on here and read that games can be played too. I am a chrome cast user so am used to managing everything on my phone not a remote but the remote is nice and has voice control which is great. I just wish the fire tv app would show what you see on screen so you can navigate from your phone instead of having it look like a mousepad. It takes getting used to. Overall it is great addition to my streaming devices.
I never thought of purchasing it until I viewed it at the store. The sales person was most helpful
Alexa is always learning and Amazon is adding new functions but sometimes (like all of the voice assistants) she sometimes can't understand the request.
Purchased tab for my kids and they love it thus far. They play games on it and it works great.
Bought this for my husband. He loves that it is so lightweight and has the built in light.
muy bueno
I love the back light and has lots of memory. Very compact...easy to carry.
I love the fact that I can expand the memory. The image is much better and faster than the stick
Echo is awesome. A talking computer of information, music, knowledge of light bulb apps, furnace apps. garage door app. Simply amazing. Give yourself a gift you will love "Echo"
It's as near as the public can enjoy towards artificial intelligence.
This is a good tablet for basic functions. It was smaller than I expected. We had a Fire when they first came out and I was thinking it would be the same size. The screen size is very small, but I guess that is why it was $49 instead of more expensive. It is good for reading, basic games and kids. But if you want to surf the web, it is really hard to see more than the top few inches of the webpage. It is great with the 8G, but would like a bigger screen for that price! :)
The Amazon Echo is a lot of fun to have. I use it for streaming music from Amazon and also as a Bluetooth speaker with my phone. Set up took about two minutes- very easy.. Getting it to play music is a lot easier and quicker than scrolling through my stored albums/artist. I'm going to try the 30 trial for Amazon's new music service. I expected it to have an even fuller range of music available. Also, my wife likes Alexa's jokes.
I love the echo as you can do many cool things with it.
I have a couple kindle fires myself. I loved them and she was looking for a reader. So I got her this kindle fire. She loves it.
Great product.....................................
Can't find a better tablet for the price! Not HD but good enough. Expandable memory is very nice!
Anyone needing a compact and easily mobile speaker should look at this. The sound quality is excellent, it is easy to sync via Bluetooth and gives you the ability to stream music when connected to wifi. Great product for the price and perfect for the office.
I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money.
My kids already broke two of my tablets. So, I want one specifically for my kids. This Amazon Fire 7 fits my needs. I'm happy with my purchase.
not as smart as the commercials show. cant answer a lot of questions
It has been nice having the echo love it bought dot for g daughter
I'd been using my phone as my e-reader but have wanted to get a stand-alone reader for a while. The screen on this is amazing and the light is a great addition. If you're on the fence- go for it.
The idea is great, a kindle just for kids. Design just for them with pre-approved content.The price was great. I got it for $79.99 on black friday. Plus, it has a 2 year full replacement warranty. They break it, we fix it. Is that simple.Content, wow tons of apps, interactive books and videos.User Interface, not the best one. Amazon should create a computer base aplication to enable and edit all content.
More powerful then it's little brother. No hesitation at all. Love the fact that I can run a network cable to it instead of using wifi.
I purchased two for my kids for Christmas. They are not as easy to maneuver as an IPad but they loved them
The text is easier to read and I don't have to have a light in order to read when the room light is dim or if it is dark.
This tablet is very affordable but its well made. For 40 bucks this is a steal.
I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets.
Love this device. I have a 16 month old that is hard set to get to nap and go to bed. Currently still on a vacation, and have been very pleased with the ease of putting on Sesame Street on the hotel tv via hbogo. no little tablet or phone needed, and has perfect picture quality
Purchased two of these tablets. Both of them had 4-7 dead pixels all over the screen. Read a lot of online reviews which stated same problem. The screen/resolution is pretty bad but what can you expect for $50.
Purchase this tablet for my brother who is handicapped. Mostly so you can watch videos off of YouTube. Pretty easy for him to understand how to use a tablet. Quality of the screen and speakers are pretty decent. Really good value for how much it costs.
I absolutely love my Amazon Echo! I have several around the house and in my office.
Cheap but biggest problem is I can't get it to download apps. The Internet connection is very weak.
AS LONG AS MY BABY IS HAPPY, I'M HAPPY! WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY?
having a 4 and 6 years old kids helps a lot.. it provides music for the kids while they are playing and my kids can ask alexa everything especially asking vocabs...
Other digital devices are distracting. Kindle keeps you focused and gives a good feeling of reading.
Bought this for my nephew since he dropped his last one in the toilet and we didn't purchase the accidental coverage last time. He is only 8 but loves to play games on it. Since it's linked to my amazon account I can see what games he is downloading and control the purchases made. Definitely a must have for long car rides!
Fire TV box is great for streaming shows, movies, or music. I connected it directly to internet rather than using wifi and have not had any issues with buffering.
I am really glad i decided to purchase the firebox. Faster than the stick.
I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. It is a great tablet. She loves it and it works great.
We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
I bought two of these for my grandchildren because they wanted one and the price was right. They used one before and are very familiar with it. They will love it.
i use it to read books and it works nicely so far.
We use it to control programmable robots Dash and Dot. A great low cost solution - would rather have kids beat up the kindle fire instead of an expensive iPad
Affordable and easy to use. Holds my books and my games
The usablity wise good but install the Google store is messy
Good capabilities good sound, quick responses. Good amount of applications which respond quickly.
2nd one I've purchased! Does not run down charge quickly.l
This is a good tablet for the price, however, it runs slow and the touch screen response is not the best. This isn't the right tablet if you're looking for a high speed, high performance tablet.
This is a Christmas present so it hasn't been used yet
This is my first e-reader, and I generally like it. The lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. The text is crisp and easy to read. I'm very accustomed to using 8+ inch tablets, so a 6" screen feels a little small, but it if sufficient when you are just reading, and not looking for new books.
The dot does everything this does and most people already have blue tooth speakers to hook up to it.
My son and my daughter is very happy they play nice games
This is a wonderful tablet. It's lite weight and super simple to use. I bought one for myself and thinking of getting one for my grandmother.
I got a great deal on this and bought it. It does the basics. No more. No less. The display is below average, at best. And the Amazon App Store is a bit clunky. But you get what you pay for and I'm satisfied.
My daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. And it does do everything I wanted it to do for her. The free year of Amazon Freetime is an awesome bonus!! The only problem I have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. This happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. I wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is GREAT for my daughter and she has so much fun with it!! I'm sure other kids will love it also!!
I Love my echo. I use my echo for just about everything. I've set up my lights, my tv, I also ask it several questions almost every day. My wife uses it to get cooking measurements. I play music and games as well.
I purchased the Amazon Fire because you can get the PS Vue app. The system is easy to use and the picture quality is great.
Works great and was easy to set up. Will get rid of cable with this device.
So easy to use and surprisingly good sound! Use it all the time!
love it....very nice...really easy to navigate and it has a lot of things. Control remote easy to operate
This is a fantastic tablet and only cost $35. Can't beat it. It has ads but they're not obnoxious. Would definitely recommend it.
I loved the kindle. But it took one small fall about 3 feet and half of the lcd screen broke. It's ruined I knew to be careful but on the first fall on wood floor???
Good tablet for the price. Typically when you pay a small price for a tablet you get a piece of junk, but not this tablet. Its great.
Bought one of these two weeks before on Amazon and paid almost double for what Best Buy had these for. So, i bought another one the same day as this!
Nice tablet will seriously think about getting a second one.
Brought a Echo just to listen to music while i have my morning coffee in my study but find out it so much more absolutely love it sounds good amd its easy to start up
Readers are going to like this tablet that includes the kindle feature, it has basic tools like camera(not very good), calculator, calendar, and the amazon appstore. I didnt like that it doesnt include the google appstore, cause the amazon appstore doesnt have some of the apps I use the most on my cellphone. It is good for the price anyways...
1st Amazon Fire, I love it! Best investment for my tv.
I needed this for my daughter and needed a tablet that cal handle all my daughters apps and have parental saggy This has it all
Best product out there, worth buying all day, wouldnt pass on it
Easy to use. Would recommend the Kindle Fire for any age person.
My brother-in-law and his family have enjoyed it very much. He says finding songs is better and faster than Pandora
My daughter's Google tablet had run its course so I purchased this. I miss the simplicity of android.
Was looking for a device that I can load Kodi on. This Fire TV is more than capable of doing what I needed it for!!! So glad that they were sold out of the fire stick when I was looking for it, the extra memory on the Fire TV is coming in handy
Was a nice deal for 50 bucks can't beat that and its fast and works great
Love the tap. The speaker is nice. Likenit has a charging cradle it can sit on. Easy charge.
easy to use and just the right size, love the ease of operating the device, small enough to carry around. still access all my favorites
Good first tablet or back up to take with you without hazard to a better one.
Good choice for the price, good performance, and fast.
I like this tablet, great features and functionality for a good price.
Our grand daughter is very happy with her fire kids edition. Product wotks great.
I bought this as a Christmas present for my young nephew. Easy Wi-Fi set up and works great .
Bought this for my elderly non-tech friendly mom. Because it's so user friendly she's able to navigate it and enjoy its features without assistance.
I bought this fire tv to try it out at my business. I didn't want to pay for cable or satellite, so I gave it a go. I'm happy I did, now I don't have to worry about anything. I have everything I need right there from music to movies. It keeps my guest happy so it's a win for me.
Was hoping the screen a little bigger, but over all great picture, easy to use
Not bad can with stand my almost 2 yr old daughters wrath of every day wear and tear. So it's a win for me....
My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty.
The Fire TV has changed the way we watch television. We no longer have expensive cable and don't miss it at all
Excited about this product, it is going to be fun to use and an interesting addition!
Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use
This is a great tablet!!! I absolutely would recommend it to a friend!! I would buy it again!!
Great tab. Purchased as a give for a Christmas party.
Navigates easily. Many channels. Fast connection speeds.
Easy to use. My daughter loves it! The graphics are crystal clear extremely user friendly.
I use echo everyday to check on weather and listen to music
Great for my grandchildren when they come over and then I use it also good for all ages .
First off you can't go wrong with the price, $50 (or if you can even catch it on sell) is a steal for any piece of Tech. Now I've seen people compare this to an ipad or samsung tablet, which you can't. This doesn't have retina display or anything like that, But for the price point it does a good job. I've had mine since the black firday sell and its still been working really good. I also got one for my mom and my nephew. I generally use mine for emails and amazon orders along with reading the time to time book, netflix, and the few games that I've purchased. My mom and nephew use it mainly to play games. If your looking for retina display or something with apple or andriod features and don't mind the extra $150 or $300 bucks by all means I suggest getting one of the higher end tablets. But I can't complain with this new Amazon fire 7 as it works just as good for me. I'd recommend buying a sd card however if you want a little extra space.
I bought this for several reasons, the 2 year warranty, ease of use. My granddaughter is 21 months old and she has figured it out. Very durable, she drops it and it keeps on working
The product works well. Great price for the capabilities it offers.
It was a great experience. I will be back in the future!!
The only thing holding this device back is Amazon's unwillingness to play nice with other media companies and as a result it is very difficult to obtain certain digital items on this device if it is not immediately available on the Amazon store. Even so, very good purchase.
it was the first time that i purchased something like this and it was a gift so i asked and she loved it.
My kids love their amazon kindles! They can take them anywhere and play on them! Great battery life!
good deal . purchased for my mother , killer mothers day present. get what you pay for
This has been a great addition to our home. We love using it to play music and getting general information.
LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly
Tablet was for my 9yr old. It works great. It has good parental controls. It could use a little more memory but well worth the money paid. Ship to store worked perfectly.
This tablet is great for kids and is easy to set up and operate. Great price! Bought durning Black Friday weekend but Best Buy still had them available for the whole weekend!
I have enjoyed this product everyday since I purchased it. I would highly recommend it.
We replaced and aging fire HDX. She noticed the WiFi connection is improved and the screen is larger. She prefers this to my iPad Air
Watching the ads in the beginning, I was skeptical on how useful the Echo would truly be in my life; but once I opened it and spent a little time adding things like "skills" (which you find in the app and can enhance Alexa beyond belief), I quickly realized how much I LOVE this device! I have it hooked up with my Harmony remote (a Logitech product) that I purchased from Best Buy, along with any and all other accounts I have, such as Pandora, iHeart Radio, etc., and now I find myself asking Alexa to do almost everything; i.e., "Alexa, play some _____ (artist) station", to "Alexa, turn on my Blu-Ray Player/ TV/ Apple TV/ Radio". This device I can truly see is the beginning of where home technology is headed.
It has many uses. You can listen to music, check the weather, listen to podcasts and music. You can also use it as an alarm.
Love this kid's tablet - it's kid proof! It's perfect for kids of all ages!
This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.
Very small and handy, very easy to use, and Perfect for travel.
This product works awesome for getting current movies and tv shows. We live in a rural area so we have some buffering issues which is sometimes frustrating but overall this is a great product and has provided access to many more viewing options
This Fire TV does everything that I need it to and more. It's stable and never have any issues. Ever since I got it, I use it daily.
It's amazing how quickly Alexa has become a central component to our household.
Very durable cover Takes the abuse that a 3 year old gives it
Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker — opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured — when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy.
Wife is happy. As they say happy wife, happy life.
It is amazing! Most wonder product ever bought! Would recommend it
I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach.
At this low price compared to competitors, it's a convenient solution for a variety of applications. I keep it in the living room as a controller, having loaded the Harmony app to control activities and devices via the Harmony hub.
Very good deal!! Quality top with very good price!!!
Bought these for all the grandkids for Christmas. Basic enough for a 10 year old but with enough features and capability for the 18 year old!
I am very happy with my purchase. It is very small which I like because it can fit just about anywhere and does not take up much room
I got tired of high cable bills and joined the cord cutting stampede. This works great and I save $100 a month. I also got a deal for half off the antenna for local channels when I bought it. Can't go wrong.
My kids love this tablet! All the fun without the steep price!
I read reviews on Amazon some bashing it because they said the screen wasn't paper white. Well it isn't IF you have the back light off. It's white with the back light on. Even with my back light on durning daylight I still got a few weeks of read time out of this. It's amazing don't let others tell you it's not. And the adds only on the lock screen.
Just needs more memory, but we can handle that. My boys love them!
For those who truly just want an EReader, the kindle gets the job done. No glare , easy to use.
The Fire TV is a good device with a powerful processor and the best Playstation Vue interface. However, it can be frustrating to access the channels you've added as you have to either search for the channel or thumb through them all - one by one. The Roku allows you to arrange your channels in whatever order you choose. The Roku has the most channel options - including Vudu (a channel not available on the Fire TV). Still, if you intend to use the Playstation Vue service you'll be much happier with the Fire TV.
Pretty basic tablet. Lagging processor but it works.
The fire stick provides excellent 4k quality and is easy to use
I bought this for my husband whom is in medical school and he loves it! He has his textbooks there and can carry it with him everywhere. Best thing is that is easy on the eyes
enjoying this tablet. purchased so I could have a bigger screen for shopping when I don't wanna pull my laptop out. so far it is serving the purpose. didn't know it came in colors until I opened it.
I bought this for my son and he.loves it. He reads and plays games on it all the time.
Perfect tablet for reading and browsing on the internet .
I personally use this product to control home automation devices, a morning alarm, add things to my shopping list, a kitchen timer, and to listed to music and all of these tasks seem to work really well. Setup is super easy.
I was so pleased with my Fire tablet that I purchased two more for my nieces who are 4 and 2-1/2 years old. Those little fingers love the games and other features and keep the girls busy in their car seats. I love playing games, checking the weather, reading emails, and general surfing on the web with my Fire tablet.
This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.
Bought for my K classroom!! Great price for student use!!
This thing is great. I discover a new feature almost every day. I don't know how I lived without it.
After looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the Amazon Fire HD 8 seemed like the best choice. The fact that it was on-sale one-third off on Black Friday made the final choice easy. We are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. Easy for us mid-seventy year-olds to use.
great tab in low price and worth to spend. It has everything what i am looking for.
Amazon Echo is the bee's knees. You can talk to it and stuff and it talks back and does stuff for you. I use it mostly for playing music and making grocery lists.
If you are looking for a reader that is just a bit more than a reader this is the right product. I bought this for my wife so she would stop trying to read on her small phone, and she absolutely loves it. Battery life is good, build quality is great, for the price there is really no comparison.
I use most of Amazon services (Prime, Kindle, Music, Video, Alexa) and this is the best companion to access all services seamlessly. This tablet also has great features/expansion and performance.
This is a fine tablet for $49. A bit heavy and not the most advanced piece of technology but for $49 it isn't bad.
If youre choosing between this and the apple tv , I find this to better as long as you dont plan on connecting things through the cloud.
Its very good tablet for the price. I have owned previous versions
I had purchased this item before, had to buy a second one , best streaming device on market
Loved it. Perfect type of lighting and so lightweight!
My old Kindle was broken, so I received the Paper white for a Christmas gift. I love it! It is small and light enough to carry anywhere, and I love that I can adjust the back light to accommodate day or dark.
It still has some things that needs to be updated. Does not know a lot of things when asked. Great for music in the room.
affordable great for on the go and everyday usages
I bought this for an employee of mine. She loves it. It is light compact and allows her to carry tons of books with her. She is huge book reader so this is a must for anyone that is a big reader. She always thinks it is really easy to read also with the white background.
This is a fun piece of technology that can link into your home, I.e. Hue and nest and even your refrigerator. Love the capability but she is still limited by what other tech I have in the house. You can even have her order your groceries.
Upgraded; easy to use; thinner; very happy with it.
Easy to setup and use and now with voice search. I recommend it with even 4K content. Best Buy had it on sale as well.
This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one.
Got this for my mom who wanted to read and use it for apps. Perfect tablet for that and the price is great. You can't go wrong with a Fire Tablet.
Does the job, especially at that price! After using colored tablets, it does take some time to get used to though.
Christmas present for a friend. They absolutely love it!
I wish it was a little smarter right out of the box. Most of the questions I asked it at first it couldn't answer. Don't call her stupid. I did and she was still listening and she told me she is still learning. I actually started to feel bad I said it. I told her I was sorry and she forgave me for it. My wife listens to music everyday and it sounds great. The built in mics can pick up your voice from just about anywhere in the room and you don't have to raise your voice. After I did a little research and read up about all of the things it can do I could spend month's and still not use all of the features.
Upgrades from fire stick. Works good but I really don't see the difference between the stick. I guess a little faster and less buffering
Battery seems to drain quickly. Otherwise very happy with this device! Great price!
Love the idea of it. Not as easy to put the DVD movies on it .
Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids
Purchased the Kindle PaperWhite because I got tired of reading on regular tablets and ipads. Those devices really do strain your eyes...not so with the Kindle. The display is crisp and amazing. The battery life is astronomical. Highly recommended and for the price...it is a steal.
Had this, have the dot, have two Google homes. I prefer Google home. You can YouTube rhere differences. Alexa is okay but nothing extraordinary. I use it to turn on lights, and that's about it.
Really satisfied with my purchase it's a good product for those just starting to get familiar with using tablets. Amazons a good product.
My old Google Nexus was on it's last legs and I had already changed the USB charge port and things were going south quick. I picked up the Kindle Fire and have been happy ever since.
Just wish I could remember everything we can ask Alexa.
Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
Slow with limited application. Battery doesn't last long and the download speed is less than expected.
We love our echo! Alexa is very useful. Especially for my mom. Can turn the lights o and off while not moving!
This was a gift and they love it so much that I think I will get more
I only use it for some apps and that's it. It's pretty nice
Awesome screen and battery life! Also lightweight and handy.
Bought as a gift. Super excited. I hope it lives up to the hype. Can't wait til she unwraps it
This tablet is great at what it does:Netflix, Amazon, and general Internet searches. It obviously does other things and for the price it's fantastic.
This little device is great for it price. Lots of features.
Paid $35 on sale. This tablet offers great capability for most people. Very good item for Amazon Prime members. Not the greatest specs but works fine. The ads aren't too annoying. The micro-SD slot allows you to put lots of music/video on this unit.
Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read.
Be sure to join Amazon Prime and have access to lots of free reading downloads
First tablet , got it for my wife, she found it very easy to use and loves it.. She is not not computer savvy, but has no problem navigating what she uses her tablet for
To the best of my knowledge the Recipients enjoyed it
This tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!
Bought this tablet for our 6 year old son for Christmas to play games and take pictures along with a unicorn beetle defender case and it has totally exceeded our expectations! Totally worth the little bit of money you spend!
Slow connecting, basic model, still a good product just not very advanced
Easy on the eyes. Smaller and even better than earlier versions
This was a great price and excellent gift. It has a lot of built in apps that both adults and kids will enjoy.
I have other kindle and got this just so everyone has access to all of our prime membership features. And so they would leave my kindle HD alone.lol. Easy setup and straightforward intuitive to use.
Boy! If I had something like this when I was a kid. The learning devices these kids have today. Makes learning about different things in & around the world a fun experience. all the other activities & downloadable apps, they can be on it for hours. Like it!
My son is 6 and I can control everything he does on his tablet! I love it and love that learning games came installed
Purchased this for my mother for Mother's day. It was very easy to set up and very easy for her to use. Great buy and value.
My 5 yr old loves it, however we do experience some sound issues from time to time.
Goog tablet the only bad part is that you have to be creating a profile and thats where it gets complicated because when they sell u the tablet they saw its for kids
This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite.
What a great product! Easy to set up and a great "assistant"!
NICE TABLET, BUT IT WANTS YOU TO PUT ALL YOUR BILLING INFORMATION IN AND A CREDIT CARD TO DO ALL PURCHASES. IS A HASSLE TO PULL UP PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THIS. GOOD FOR A CHILD.
I love my kindle paperwhite. So easy to read anywhere. Wish the battery lasted longer than it does.
My wife loves reading, and being able to have so many books to choose from is great. The price of the kindle is also great. If you factor in the cost of books. This was a great investment for her.
There is no better E-reader available today. It costs a bit more, but the build quality is the best.
Great value for money. However, the screen lags a bit after input. Once you figure that out, then you just need to be a bit patient.
Decent product. It's definitely not for anyone who wants a tablet to stream or play games (other than amazon prime and laggy games) but it's OK for internet browsing and general use. It's on the lowest end of the tablet prices, so you get what you pay for
Alexa has become part of our family. We love listening to music with it.
Perfect color, size and price for our family needs.
I hate the ads. They are annoying and you cannot get them off. It's super confusing how to even get to the home page
Really love my Fire HD. Very easy to browse the internet. Is an excellent EBook Reader. Amazon apps are great!
Please don't let the cheap price of this tablet fool you. I can do a lot with it: surfing the web, downloading apps, playing games, etc. There's an issue with the volume of Amazon Fire 7 (not quite loud enough for me even when I turn the volume to its max). But I think I still did a great decision to buy it. Good product overall.
Using to have PlayStation Vue. Works great and can be used for other services
Exactly what it is supposed to be. Works great and I love the built-in light. Perfect reader, and very quick delivery.
My children love it. Los of different things they can do to learn
Place Amazon orders.. use reminders, timers, music.. love it!
I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media.
Love my Echo. Has amazing stereo sound and has lots of new items added on a regular basis. I use it for nites, reminders, timers, setting alarms, music and general knowledge.
Q: What's the difference between a 19.99 Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Supply and a 5.95 5V 1A (1000mA) USB port power supply - UL ListedA: 14.04 Calling it a 5W charger rather than a 5V 1A charger is a distinction without a difference.
I love to read books....paper and electronic (via my iPad), but had never owned a Kindle. When shopping at Best Buy, I mentioned to my husband that I might want to try a Kindle....went to another area and, when I returned, the Kindle VOYAGE was in our basket. OK so I though I would give it a try. I LOVE it! So compact, so easy to read my books and turn the pages without swiping or ??? I highly recommend the VOYAGE to existing and pending Kindle readers. So many great features in such a small package!
I bought this as a gift for my niece, she loves it very much!
Once connected to my wi-fi, it would not connect to daughters wi-fi when I visited her. The loading time for programs is really slow. Oh well, what did I expect for only $49??
Bought this as a gift - they seemed to like it. The price was nice and so was the size of it.
Like then light. Easy to read outside. Just easier to read overall.
Amazon Fire TV is easy to use and is very easy to setup.
Bought this for my very busy sister of two so she didn't have to lug a laptop around. She loves it - the quality of use (camer, web browsing, speed, etc.) was much more than we expected! Great item!
I have had some issues with this but not having a very helpful team to resolve issues.... I work and go to school I don't have time after time to beg and plead to get fixed...
This is such an awesome product I highly recommend it  very easy to use and capable of so much!
How can you go wrong with a 35.00 tablet on black Friday deals.I should of bought more when I had the chance
So far so good. Works as expected, but it will be more useful when we purchase additional accessories to connect it to more parts of the house. Voice recognition is excellent even from another room.
Nice tablet for the price. I purchased it for my niece and she loves it.
I was actually a usability tester on the very first Kindle and I'd always thought about buying one. After using the Kindle app on various tablets (iPad and Samsung) I finally realized that what I was mostly using the tablets for was the Kindle App.Buying one was a no-brainer and the Paperwhite is excellent. The Bookerly font is exceedingly readable and the backlighting is adjustable so that I don't keep my significant other awake when I'm reading in bed. It's lightweight and the perfect size for putting in the pocket of my cargo shorts or in a jacket pocket.
Easy to use,access books,love the apps,clear pict.
Good for watching movies offline but not so good at internet. I also have problems with it deciding I don't have the SD card in and have to take it out and put it back in. Very frustrating!!! The first one I had didn't know the SD card was there after shutting it off. They were great about sending me a new one but now I have to call them back and tell them what is going on now. I prefer to use my old Android tablet. It also won't let me remove the password or I have to take off the free time. I have to call them and see what I can do about that. It is for her and not really for me anyway. Why do I have to have a password for everything? Not too impressed but a really good buy. The ads, when you turn it on, don't bother me at all and was worth saving the $20.
My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
I would say that it is not for kids is because my kids have been downloading game after game even with a 64 gig sd card the main operating system only allows about 2 gigs of games that cannot be transferred to the data card so storage is very limited
It's a good little tablet but just a little annoying because of the ads on the lock screen to make us have to pay more for the tablet to get a tablet that doesn't have the ads on the lock screen is kind of ridiculous. So for that reason I only gave it 4 stars it's a good tablet does what they say it does but don't like the fact that you have to pay extra to get a tablet that is ad free.
I was looking for an easy and functional tablet for my parents for Christmas. They are learning how to use it.
My second Kindle. I've also owned a Nook. Both are good but the Kindles screen is a little better. I also like the case available for it much better than the Nook's.
The overall price and quality for this item was hands down a great value
It's so cool it's scary. Kids love it, I love it. Awesome
I now have two of these devices. I control my lights, thermostats and wall switches through this.
I bought this for my spouse, I already have one and know what to expect. Shop around for best price! Only black was available but at least it was in stock. Staff were helpful.
They are ok for a kid to play games on. But I don't like it for myself. I will just save for an iPad.
Love it! Alexia is at your service. Love the ability to play a variety of music. Great product!
I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.
My kids love this tablet and I love the price so it's a win win situation
Great addition for those that are building onto your smart home. Great connection with nest, hue lights and august lock. Have two dots as well. Great machines!
This is so great! Love it and looking forward to ditching my cable company!!
Great for kids! It's very easy for them to navigate.
It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want.
Perfect little tablet for my son for Christmas. The price makes it a steal for a tablet these days. In addition it meets the requirements a 7 year old has for media needs. He's able to read his homework on it nightly plus take pictures of which he's addicted to lately!
I really like it, I can see the letters perfectly and it has a perfect size
This item has allowed me to eliminate my cable. I love having any movie I want at my fingertips.
This is a great table for the price. I purchased it so my grandchildren would leave my ipad alone. Its not an ipad but I have no complaints for the price. I find myself using it a lot playing games and surfing the internet. It is pretty fast and easy to use. I told my daughter about it and she purchased 2 for her twins.
Works great! Just wish it worked with Alexia. Way more features than Apple TV.
bought this for my 2yr old and he loves it. great price for the features
best on the market you can watch movies from amazon live tv
I bought this as a birthday gift a few weeks before the party. When it was removed from package and turned on, the image was cracked like the screen was broken, but screen was not broken. Best Buy washed their hands of it and said to call Amazon. I did and had to go through over a week's worth of calling them to get it replaced. Best Buy lost me as a customer over this. If you buy this from them, make them open it before you pay to verify it works.
Anything I have time to watch I can see on this box. Cuts cable bill in half.
I seem to enjoy this in most catagories. Wasn't sure about the tall and narrow screen layout at first with reading books, but when placed side by side with old ereader, no strain to learn new layout. Only thing not happy about is the lack of under $10 cases. Not wanting to spend $25 and up for a $49 unit. I'm sure that will change. This is a real good product in a usually subpar price point. I think this will be a game changer.
These kindles are the perfect gift for kids (and adults) of all ages! Everybody in my family owns one and we use them daily!
The idea behind this is great, but the technology might not be there yet. I've had some issues with dialog from TV shows setting it off.
The Amazon tablet line is possibly one of the best our there. The functionalities of android and windows with the ease of use equal to an Ipad
Good tablet for the price. Easy to use. User friendly
This device is easy to setup very fast and provides a great quality picture.
This was the best purchase .. I highly recommend it
was cheap, can not run chrome stuff, returned to store.
This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better
Arrived intact, and works well to charge my little kindle.
Love this box so much. No longer need cable. Love being able to watch all my favorite movies and tv shows
I bought this tablet because of its size, makes a perfect cheap ereader plus can do lots of other tablet tasks. Highly recommend this for everyone wanting a good cheap tablet
This is my second Amazon Fire TV product, first I had the Fire TV stick which was great but a little under-power so I went ahead and upgraded to the Fire TV box and I have to say that this box is great. The streaming picture is gorgeous!! I am using it hard wired so I can't talk about the Wifi, but the videos load basically instantly and it never looks pixelated. I installed Kodi and it works great!!, Alexa is very handy and can even do shopping lists for you. The only thing that I don't like is that the search feature on the box it only gives you results from the Amazon Video store, it doesn't give you results from Netflix, Hulu or others. It has a MicroSD card slot which is very handy if you are planning to download a lot of games, the remote works great and comes with batteries. Overall is a great box and if you have an Amazon Prime subscription is definitely a must!! You won't find a better and more organized Amazon instant video app.
I love the size of the kindle. It is great to be able to put it in my purse. Also, main reason is I need to read outside sometimes and need to use sunglasses. The white paper make is real easy to read.
My kids love this tablet especially to watch their YouTube videos. Easy to use and has a great feature that dims the screen brightness ( I set the timer to dim b/w 9 pm and 6 am so that if my son watches it in bed it wont keep him awake) Easy to use
Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised.
I bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening. She had a huuuge portable speaker that didn't sound very good and used many double 'd' batteries. This one sounds better and lasts all day. I was concerned she wouldn't be able to figure it out, but it is so user friendly she has no issues with it. She loves it and that is a good thing.
Bought this for my hubby. Loves it- great for music, recipes, etc.
Cheap and best product from amazon. Almost 6+ tabs bought recently. This shows how i am inspired with tables
I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
This is my first piece of streaming equipment, and it was simple to set up and use. The remote control is convenient, and it has voice control. This apparatus makes streaming movies from Amazon Prime super easy.
got this for my mom cause her other one died. Found out that these were only $50 which was a really good price from what she needed. The screen was a lot bigger than her last one and the screen was a whole lot sharper as well. If youre looking to give a basic tablet to someone who doesnt need to do anything business like or school related then this is the tablet you should get.
great piece of technology. wish I would have found this sooner.
Simple to use, a must own if you have Amazon Prime
It was a gift for my mother-in-law and she loves it.
Overall satisfying tablet. My wife loves it and uses it almost every day! Would recommend getting a case and screen protector.
Good sound & clarity. Also i would say it is good value.
Gave it as a gift, but my father absolutely loves it. he had been using one of the old Kindle DX readers.
My son always wants to play on my tablet. This was an excellent deal. Best Christmas gift!
I bought this Amazon Fire tablet for my daughter and she loves it. It has good screen resolution and you can increase memory by inserting a micro sd card.
for the price you cant beat this, my daughter loves it and wont put it down and the protective case def helps when it is dropped trust me , cannot go wrong with a kindle for this price
Sturdy and easy to use. Not bad for teenagers to use
My almost 4 year old will recieve this for christmas this year but i set it all up prior. I love the parental locks and timers!!!! Soooooo many fun characters for her to choose from to enjoy at every level. The case is soft and light but sterdy!
I bought this tablet for my grandson for Christmas and he is loving it
We al love them. It's great for Netflix and everything else
Okay don't like the setup. I like Android way better. Cannot download you tube. It is for my six year old who has lost 3 3ds xls if he can keep this one from damage's for 6 months he gets an up grade.its very small
Frustrated that it has a hard time understanding me.
Other kindle had a hole in screen from kids...upgraded to the paper white screen, works great
My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well
I purchased for my grandchildren and they work fine for watching Netflix or Amazon movies, however, Kindle offers no app for YouTube which is a somewhat of a drawback for kids. Nice to access books for kids to encourage reading. Also like the parental controls so kids can't make a purchase without your knowledge.
my wife had a kindle for 10 years and it finally died on her , this was a great replacement
Good for travel, easy to use and long battery power.
Works great. No issues with it since I bought it a month ago. A good beginners tool for someone buying their first tablet. A great value at a reasonable price.
Everything you could want in a tablet including Bluetooth. Some popular game apps not available. The camera is very poor quality. Hard to find an inexpensive shockproof case. I got it for $35 on black Friday and it does the job well.
I love it because it give me access to all my favorite shows
Great way to enjoy reading wherever you are. The lighting feature is definitely worth it, as you can read it anywhere.
Works perfect, very accurate. Love every aspect of this machine. Great sound.
Love it. Does the job. Works well bur not with the direct tv now app.
I got this to try out cutting the cable. Being an Amazon Prime member I knew that I had some content already available but there are so many options when you get to looking. I really like the Ethernet port that I can hard wire from my modem to make sure that I am running at max speeds.
I like to buy my ink cartridges at Best Buy because of the recycling program.
GOOD PURCHASE HAPPY WITH PRODUCT, WOULD RECOMMENDS
I bought 1 of everything. Like this one the best. VERY good sound, grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music.
Excellent product, it was very easy to install. Compatible to all of our electronic equipment. Very user-friendly – love that it it has the voice feature on the remote.
Needless to say..Kindle Paperwhite is awesome product worth of millions as it holds invaluable books in 4GB space as well as in amazons cloud ... Its 6" anti-glare touch-screen display with 300 ppi resolution gives you a real feel of reading... its night mode gives the flexibility to read books in dark... Battery backup lasts for days....perfect for book lovers.. give it a try.. all the best..
Purchased for my son for Christmas and he loves it /. Great price
This tablet works great and my daughter loves it. Only reason not 5 stars is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet. Way to ruin android amazon.
We love the Amazon Echo. I look forward to using it for shopping list.
Great buy. Cheaper than paying for overpriced cable
We bought three of these while on sale. They replace my ereader and my children's ipod touches and we use them every day. I cannot stress how good of a deal this is! While the display isn't the best - you're getting far mor than what you pay for.
Waste of money
I can get rid of the old stereo/radio in my family room. I use it all the time.
Long battery life. Great overall digital reader. I highly recommend this product.
Love my new Echo. Ask it questions...get the answers. Want music...tell it and you get it. Sound is really good and listening to my voice is very good.
The item is great also great for kids for the price you can't beat it.
Our six year old grandson wanted a tablet to use when he visits. This has all the features we were looking for, it is secure, only allows the kind of educational and fun applications we approve of.
This fit my price range perfectly so that is why I bought it. Works as expected.
SIMPLE AND VERY USER FRIENDLY. HAS ALL THE LATEST APPS AND AMAZON'S PRIME USER CONTENT IS SUPERB.
Thought it couldn't get any better than my Fire Stick.. Turns out it can be faster!
As a nook user, I had to make a change, so I tried the kindle. It is good.
The tablet is great and works perfectly for any use
I purchased this as a gift. It was just what he expected. He is still learning all about it.
Wife never leaves it at home loves it great display easy on your eyes
Great gift, easy to set up and very user friendly.
Alexa is very entertaining and provides a plethora of information at the sound of your voice. I must say, however that SIRI is more personable. I hope Alexa loosens up as time goes on.
It's a great alternative to cable and satellite tv...
I am still learning this product as it does not come with instructions/directions and is trial and error process. However I am pleased with what I do know about this product and the performance that I am getting out of it.
The best advice I can give after 3 devices and 2 years later
I got 4 of these tablets, one for each of the kids, and they LOVE them! I love that I can set time limits on it and that I could set it up that they have to read for 30 min before they can play on them. I also like that there are a ton of apps and books that are free.
Cool item. Also purchased the Dot to use upstairs. Very convenient verses finding/picking up the phone. Love the daily Jeopardy questions.
One of the coolest pieces of tech I own !! Playing music on command is just one fun feature of the Amazon Echo, it is capable of so much more.
I bought this for my 5 year old to watch movies on. It does the job but it takes a while just to get Google Play. They tried to block this feature but you can go youtube on how to add it. Other than that I would never buy this for myself but good enough for a kid for movies.
I am so happy I bought it. The sound is great and so very easy to use. Eventually would like to get another for upstairs.
Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions
I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with. I also have a bunch of books from my Amazon.co.uk site which I access on my 'old' Kindle (I couldn't work out how, if at all, I can move books from one Amazon jurisdiction to another) so this has proved a good purchase all round.
This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.
I bought this tablet for my ten year old son. It's perfect for him! He loves to download music and games on it.
I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text.
Love it very easy for young readers. Would definitely recommend
Love my new reader. It took a while to sort out all of the functions as it is quite different from my old Kindle. Now however it goes with me everywhere. I especially like the back light that makes reading always easy.
I will use this on the plane to watch a movie or play some downloaded games. For the price on black Friday, you can't beat it.
Love my Echo. I look forward to new apps as they become available. I especially enjoy the daily greetings and the timers which really come in handy when cooking.
This is a good tablet, next time I buy a tablet I will get a bigger one. It does all we need it to. Great for kids!
Long battery life, holds thousands of books so it saves space. Fits in most pocketbooks so you can take with you everywhere. Glad I purchased it. Easier to read than the regular kindle.
I love to buy stuff at best buy Most of the employees are great at helping With everything i needEspecially JISSELA
Love it best purchase especially if you have someone to program it for you!
Works exactly as advertised. I love it! Great battery life as well.
My granddaugther constantly drops her tablet and this is perfect for her.
I love the quality on the streaming is my first box I have 2 firesticks, amazing box from amazon.
The tablet is about worth what you pay for it. But that's what happens when you only pay 50.
I can't say enough about the Amazon echo! I can't believe for under $200 you not only get a high quality speaker but a smart home speaker. You don't have to be right on top of the speaker in order for it to understand you. I can be all the way down the hall or in another room and it understands what I'm saying. I have amazon music hooked up to it and its so nice being able to call out to "Alexa" to play any song I want. For you "techy" people, I also recommend this product. I have slowly been hooking up my entire house to her. Forget setting up a touch device to control the lights in your house. Alexa is more than capable of doing. You do need to purchase additional items in order to do so, but well worth it. I thoroughly enjoy this product and I bought the dot as well to accompany the echo.
I use this to voice control different products around the house. It can integrate with light switches and my nest for example!
Such a great purchase! It's way better than I had anticipated! Wish I would have bought one sooner
Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!
not hard to set up even for me , one who is not so tech savvy
I am able to stream movies without any buffering issues and the voice command makes searching for shows very easy.
It's the best choice for $30 to leave home or with friends.
Way too expensive
Great picture, hooked up via Ethernet it works flawlessly. With fire Tv there is no need for a "smart tv" or a cable bill.
I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read.
I love the jokes and music. It brings my favorite songs with great speaker quality.
As the title says, the tablet isn't bad for the price, good enough for books and just browsing the internet.
My wife uses this to read almost daily and she loves it.
I think k this is an awesome product it was very affordable and so far does absolutely everything that I need it to do and it is very user friendly easy to use I'm still getting to know this product but I have no complaints so far
This Echo worls well with my Velop wifi system. I plan to use it with automated home smart appliances. Over all it has worked great so far!!!
Bought as a family gift. We use it all the time now. Very helpful and covenient
it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
Love the ease of use and all the things it will do!
I wanted this when I first heard about it. My husband surprised me for my birthday. It was the best gift. Love Love it
I can't put this Kindle down! It's amazing to have this thing on me at all times. Best purchase of the year
Right out of the box it was great and have had no issues to date.
You'll never need cable again!! All you have to have is the Internet and depending out what kind of build you put on your fire TV that's all you'll ever need!
Bought for daughter taking American Lit class that requires alot of reading. She downloaded audio form and enjoys having those stories read to her while working out.
This tablet does everything that was advertised, but only a fraction of the cost! A great buy!
Speaker quality is better than expected, works well in the living room, convenient addition
I bought this item for my husband for Christmas. We were wondering if he would really like it as he usually just likes to read actual books, but he immediately loved it. It's very user friendly and he has enjoyed getting to know all the ins and outs of it. It is a great way to read a book, but it has so many other uses too. I'm very glad I purchased this item. It's proven to be an excellent purchase.
Great way to increase your music library without buying cds
The tablet seems to be working well so far. It is easy to use. Has a good volume sound.
Amazing technology and excellent sound. Alexa is such a treat!! Awesome, interactive product from Amazon.
I really like the Amazon Fire 7" Tablet. I would recommend it.
I'm an avid reader. The Kindle is my go to for ease. It fits in my purse or knitting bag and stays charged for days.
I found this unit easy to setup. It also allowed me to view my Netflix account without wearing out my PlayStation .
I love that I can set time limits on how much time my kids can play. I love being able to have them read for a certain amount of time before getting to pay also
This is really cool. Having fun with it and learning Spanish from it!
My kids had one before I had got free using reward points somewhere else and it broke so replacing it. Like how these have the colored backs.
I love the Echo -- plays great music and I love the sound. It's also great for turning on lights in the house. I also check the weather and news with my Echo. I also do my grocery shopping list with Echo -- it works great!!
It was a good price and nice. It takes nice pictures.
Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it! Has so many apps I can download that he loves.
My Alexa Echo is so fun and very easy to use. I love asking her questions and having herPlay my favorite tunes.
got this for my mom and she loves it. easy to work
Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loves it and uses it all the time
Linking with Phillips Hue lighting is great, but sometimes have to repeat commands. But overall fun.
I needed this for my two six year olds to be able to use during our drive to Disney. You are unable to get most apps that are offered on iTunes and android market so I returned.
Bought this for one of my 4 young nephews; he loves it. Sharp graphics, great sound and vivid colors. We played some racing game he got me hooked to (downloaded it on my phone, now my wife/daughter tease me about it. The price was more than fair, and I like the craftsmanship (compared to the Sero 7 Pro I own), its light and ease to carry, and keeps youngins occupied for quite some time (added bonus)! Definitely worth the purchase.
It's the best tablet i ever. It has the coolest apps
Easiest device to read a book on. Easy to read in any light and easy to hold.
I would recommend this device over the google chrome cast, Apple TV, or roku products based on the ability to jailbreak the device/. It is very easy to jailbreak and well worth it with the step-by-step instructions available on the Internet.
For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic.
I absolutely love the Amazon Echo. It was by far one of my best purchases. It can sync with nearly everything, and on top of it you don't need to get off the couch or out of bed to use it. It recognizes your voice and answers right away, without delay. I would recommend this for anyone!
I love the adjustable font size and the front light which allows me to read in any lighting even without my glasses. Pagepress allows me to turn page effortlessly and i can close my book turning it off and when i resume reading I'm right back where i left off. Love it. Capacity is unbelievable.
I do like the Amazon fire TV. There are a few things I do not like. Mainly the layout of the menus amd getting around. To many duplicates displayed and to many pay for shows mixed in. Even with prime there are things you have to pay for. There is an option to see only prime but you have to set it each time and that blows. They really need to work on thier menus.
Thr fire is a great gadget for almost any occasion or circumstance, gathering info. or just relaxing.
I am enjoying my Kindle very much! Easy to down load books and easy to read! Very happy with my purchase!
Really great piece very good quality and very clear
Removed from the box and put the device immediately into operation.
Runs smoother then the fire stick. Love the idea of picking and paying for only the channels I want.
This product is great and user friendly. It's easily accessible and has plenty of apps and Channels to watch!
I bought the tablet for my one year old son so we can use it in the car. It just a great buy. I recommend it to anyone that has young kids.
my son uses it to learn about the internet. down loaded some games. that he can play and have fun with. was a little small. I wish I got a bigger one. but it was a good price. still need to figure out how to do more with it. like take pics,
My Alexa is the smartest! She knows a lot about everything! It's amazing how quickly she can answer a question, whether it's about math, history, a person, or event, etc. Even my husband is impressed!Played with my brothers Alexa for a couple weeks and ordered one for me. She was greeting me when I returned home. Love her!
Like Siri 2.0. Lots of fun and a decent speaker. Though, wish it were easier to get auidobooks and music on it, etc. Doesn't always get what you were looking for but still tries to get something close to it. Gives helpful overviews and recaps of news and weather.
it is awesome!! the only bad thing is you have to pay for unlimited music
I received my Echo as a gift. I use it often for keeping lists, acquiring weather information and whenever I I have a question. I gave this Echo as a gift and the recipient loves it as much as I do.
Makes.an old TV new again. Wonderful if you are a prime member.
Great product but every hard to get a hand on one very user friendly
did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product.
The resolution on this screen is amazing and is so close to an actual printed page.
Bought for our son so he wouldn't have to carry books back from his deployment
Someone who like to begin their journey to tab world that is absolutely one to get.
The size, speed and battery are perfect for students to use on the go or just hangin in their rooms.
Great for kids of all ages, purchased two tablets and they love them..
Love the Kindle fire 7. I'm on my 8th one and that's due to my clumsiness and knack of losing things. I've had one Kindle fire 8 but I much prefer the 7's due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother...im totally lost without it.
Echo is amazing still learning more things,great product
Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
It gets the job done...................Great to buy......
Bought this for Christmas 2015. After about 9-10 months the battery began to fail to hold a charge. While the first 9 months were good -- as many of the reviews here laud this tablet -- the 90 day warranty is disappointing from Amazon. (When I did have a different Amazon device fail within the warranty period, their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device -- so the only warranty issue is with the length.)I'd recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it's just average.
It's a cool gadget. My kids love to ask Alexa to tell them a joke or play them a song. I enjoy having Alexa set a alarm when needed as I'm bad about charging my phone which would be my usual form of alarm otherwise.
Not the best sound for music but it'll do. I don't like that it has to be plugged in to use. Wish you could charge and go.
This is a great tablet for the price. Amazon is doing a good job
If you have an Amazon Prime membership, so that you are getting all of the videos and music, then this is a great table for tossing in your bag when on the go. It;s not the highest end, but works great with the Amazon features for a great price
The Echo looks good. It is the same as the EchoDot except the speaker is much better. It is very handy for finding and playing music. The App gives you lots of suggestions for queries, and we're having a good time with it.
The whole family loves Alexa. Great speaker. Easy to setup and use.
Like the size and ease of use. Holds charge. Easy to download books. Easy to read.
I am ALWAYS impressed with all Amazon products !!!
Easy to setup and fills the room with sound. Easy to move to another room if needed.
I really love my Kindle Fire I take it everywhere with me.. To the bathroom LOL what I really am pleased with my product I'm planning to get another one for a friend
This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.
This is a great alternative to cable. I get all my amazon videos and streaming apps for a lot less than paying for cable and the picture quality is streamed at 1080p. Happy with purchase.
Affordable tablet for kids to use. Great deal!!!!!!
Great to have - love the back lit and font changes. It's perfect for travel and reading in bed - so light weight.
This tablet is great for minimal use for a child. It is slow so I wouldn't recommend it for an adult.
My mother has the larger Amazon tablet, which prompted me to purchase this version. The tablet screen seemed smaller than a standard 7' tablet, so I returned it.
My son loves it. The picture and quality is great and my so loves all the apps from the characters he loves
I had the opportunity to cut my cable, am having a wonderful experience
I love this little kindle. It's necessary to take advantage of your Amazon Prime membership. With that membership, you get to read, every month, one their amazon unlimited kindle books. To take advantage of that aspect of your prime membership, you have to read these books on your kindle, and can't be accessed on other android tablets. That's 12 books to read for free a year. Best of all, mine was on sale for $39.99.
I just would like to say I brought this tablet for my 11 year old. And she has had it in her hand ever since. Great buy
Grand kids can play games, read and talk to their friends with this tablet. Works great for us and it was priced right too.
My teens needed something they could use to read favorite books, watch movies, edit photos, and catch up with friends on social media. The Kindle Fire 7 tablet covered all this and more at a great price.
Great product. Would be nice to have the Xfinity go app and vudu.
great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it
Went in to look at the 10' Kindle Fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. There wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. This has been a great device so far. Battery life, ease of use, etc
Echo is my favorite music device. Great sound and look.
Family had more fun with this over the holidays. Between it telling jokes and playing music on demand it made for a great time
It's a great product that allowed me to cancel cable television.
I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
Not too big not too small.. I enjoy browsing the web on my new Amazon tablet!
Kindle Fire is a decent tablet. The only turn off is the way Amazon has massacred the Android OS and makes it incompatible with chromecast most of the time. It's a great tablet for reading and saving media on the go. Other than the OS, Kindle Fire is a decent buy.
I really like this product. I can access the internet with the Fire TV and watch my shows via Netflix. It is also user friendly.
Nothing flashy. If you want something simple that you can just grab and go, use with babies/toddlers, throw around etc then this tablet is great. If you want something a little more robust save up for one of the more expensive models.
i was using the old fire tv but this one is better after all the updates
Tablet purchase good and affordable for the price.
Next release includes Alexa the famous personal assistant - so add to all the features and great value on this generation and another price drop as well!!!!
I don't have the other products to go with this so we use it for a room stereo. Produces nice sound and you control using voice commands.
Replaced a v1 nook but this is not better for reading
Love this tablet I got for both my young girls. They love them use them for games and learning games which all seem to be free for the most part.
Works well would buy it again. Dose everything they say it will.
My husband and I LOVE our Echo! Every morning, we listen to music, check the weather, and ask for our news update! I have found our Echo most helpful in the kitchen. It is nice being able to set a kitchen timer or change a song without having to touch a screen/timer. This is a MUST buy for any household. We are looking into turning our home into a "smart home". I can't to see how it works with Smart Things.
My new kindle is great for for my bible classes. I can reference the Catholic Bible and Catholic Catechism easily and download readings. I got one for my friend too.
The high resolution screen is noticeably easier to read, and the user interface is well thought out.
It sits there all day at the ready. You can just ask it a question like math or unit conversion. You can ask about the weather. Ask it to play music; turn the volume up or down, skip, or restart.
One of the best and most price efficient tablets out there
works great easy to get connected and running, have not had any issues with buffering
This is a great little tablet even with all the ads. Should have paid the extra money to not have the ads but still a great buy
Nice screen. Time limit for kids is a nice feature.
I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
Good tablet for my wife to use for social media and looking up items for remodeling our house.
I purchased the new Kindle Tablet not really knowing what to expect..I didn't read any reviews before hand, nor did I try the one in store. After getting home, charging, and applying updates I noticed there are numerous bright/stuck pixels at least 8. It's only noticeable on dark screens. I understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.As I mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. Upon first boot I went to register with my Amazon account but it returned some funky error message, I tried again and it said the device was already registered, so I was unable to complete the setup/walk through. I'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but I could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computers/tablets.All that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a Tablet at this price point to run. It's not a power house per-se but for what it's built for, consumption device, it does everything from play movies, music and casual games with out a hitch. The UI is realitivley snappy as well.Pros:- Price- IPS Screen viewable at most angles- Works well with the Amazon eco systemCons:- Mono sound (1 speaker poorly placed on back of unit)- Stuck Pixels out of the box- Low Resolution- Device registration issuesIn closing I would recommend to friends as long as they understand it's limitations.
Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking
Works great. Less buffering than Fire TV Stick. Like the voice search on it.
Wanted something small and this was perfect size .
This is the second one I have purchased in the last 2 months for a gift.
We use our echo in the kitchen it's great for multiple timers while coking, music, news flashes.
My son loves this tablet. No complaints. You can't beat the quality at this price
I managed to catch it on sale for 1299$ and use a 10% movers coupon to get it for about 1275$ after tax. TV works great and has a good picture, sound is whatever, but it's good enough for me.
This 8" tablet is much better than the older 7" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version.
I love my tablet!! I didn't think at first that I would like this size but it is perfect for me. I would recommend this tablet to all my friends.
I bought this tablet (for $39!) on Black Friday to download a few little games and play. Does a great job for that!
Please support commands for the Energysmart Water Heater Controller by Iris. Lowes Item# 612026 Model:691121 . Command such as "alexa turn water heater on" or "alexa turn water heater off" would be nice. It would gave been nice if Amazon has added a command support for this water heater controller by Iris.
The resolution on the games is not good. I didn't even try to watch Netflix because i knew it wouldn't show clearly. Also, it is slow using the internet. I assumed it would look and work like Android but i wrong. Everything is Amazon which i am unfamiliar with. Honestly, it is better for reading books. I returned for something more diverse and better.
Don't know why I waited so long to purchase this! Thinking about cutting the cord to cable,( pricing is way to high.) Purchase of the fire tv is the first step. I love it there is so much to do. I am a prime member so a lot is included with my prime membership. Movies, tv shows and music, I just can't get enough. It has lived up to an d surpassed my expectations.
So easy for parents to keep track of what their children are doing!
This is my fourth Kindle and my second Paper white. Not much to say as it meets my expectations. I can read it in any lighting conditions, sunlight to dim indoor lighting. Battery life is great as in the past. If you had a Kindle in the past or present you know what I am talking about. Those that have not had one and are thinking about buying one just do it, you will not be disappointed. I suggest that you buy the cover for your Kindle. Best thing about the Kindle is that if you fall asleep while reading it you will go back to the last page you read before falling asleep.
Good for beginners. My staff really liked this treat for christmas
I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.
Was a present for my grandson. He uses it all the time and loves it.
This is my 3rd Fire TV, so yes, I am a proud owner. I am able to watch any program that is on cable television with a simple tweak and you can too if you do a little bit of research. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Heck, I would even recommend it to Charlie Mix.
Bought 3 for kids... they stay charged through play all day (7-9 hrs) and have been dropped and slammed a few times already but still look perfect and work just like new
For the price this was an ok purchase...the camera picture is not very good to say the least but overall ok for the price.
Love it!! Alexa keeps me on track with everything!!
I use this to read things and purchase items on Amazon. It doesn't play all of my favorite games from the App Store, nor does it sync to my android projector, so I don't really get full use of the larger screen. I think for my uses, I should've just purchased the e-ink version or maybe a full-android version.
This is the first time I buy a kindle product. And the price is fairly good since I get the 20 discount! The screen reads like real papers. But the background light I think is not necessary because it will reduce the quality of reading.
First, this is a great product. Seriously there is no reason not to own one of these. If you have an Amazon Prime account it is almost a must have. Setup is simple and once you add some of the skills to Alexa it's a whole lot of fun. We have a Wemo light switch that it controls, now that setup was a bit more challenging but nothing you can't get through. Plays any radio station, must genre, tells you the weather, helps with timers in the kitchen and the shopping list function is a huge help. Let's talk about the shopping list a little. You just tell Alexa what you want to add to your list and it will all appear in list form on your mobile device in the Alexa app as a check-off list. I'll give you one downside. Alexa seems to think the CNN news reporters are talking to her as they wake her up a lot.
Still learning how to use it. Pretty user friendly.
WORKS VERY WELL ITS VERY FAST AND MAKES LOOKING FOR YOUR SHOWS A REAL TREAT MUCH FASTER THEN THE OTHER MODELS IVE USED I SAY GOOD JOB
I like the tablet, its fast enough for my daughter and would like it more without the ads or constant 'buy buy BUY!' taste I get while using it. Free underground apps are nice, my preference is plain jane android so I can control it. Do like the limit kids account I was able to setup so she doesnt change all the settings.
Easy to use and kid friendly. The price is more than fair on these and offers some decent viewing options. If it breaks no big deal to replace it!
I love it, use it just about everyday! Wasn't sure if I would like it and use it that much but find I do.
There's not much to say about the Fire. It's a great tablet that offers a lot of the price. Highly recommended!
The tablet is good for my son, he enjoys using it to play games.
It was a gift for my 94 year old mother and she was able to learn how to use it fairly quickly.
Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it
The Amazon Fire TV is an awesome system. We love it and use it every day!
I didnt know much about the amazon fire your staff did t.y. the girls love them
Black Friday deal. Great alternative for my 2 IPads.
Have been very pleased with all aspects of the Fire HD8. Good performance for the low price.
The best product that I've ever watched a movie on I love the Amazon tablet it's does amazing things
Works great time to cut off the dish this is all I need to watch you get everything.
This is the third Alexa I have purchased Once you have one you get use to having one in your house
IN LOVE WITH THE FIRESTICK. SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT AND THE PRICE WAS NOT BAD FOR WHAT IS OFFERS.
This speaker has some kick. The sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out
Upgraded from a 7" to 10" Kindle Fire and it is so worth it. Great picture. Good storage. Love my Kindle.
It's a perfect gift for young adult during the holiday session.
I bought this tablet for my son and he loves it. He enjoys playing on it and enjoying his free time app.
This is the box you want for 4k. If not get the regular stick.
Instead of buying books, it made more sense to use this Kindle as our library for the kids.
Bought the Amazon Fire tablet to read books and brows the internet. Works well very happy,
Great product and fun to use. We find new ways to use our Echo everyday.
Cheap but very awesome tablet. It has everything that you need
At this price this is a fantastic product. Good for reading as well as watching movies whilst traveling.
Wish I didn't have to sign on with a card but great product
these tablets work wonders for my needs, i didnt need a tablet to work, only for web browsing and play some games. nothing fancy, this tablet fits perfectly for that. and the price...pff perfect. ! you wont find this quality cheaper.
We are trying to make a smart house and Alexa here is the best. Alexa turns on everything we ask her to as long as we do not speak too fast. She is great for telling news briefs, weather updates, sports facts and conversions. She even plays the amazon playlists. If I am in the other room, she can still hear me if I speak a bit louder. I love Alexa!
Great Christmas gift for a young adult. She loved it
This generation works much better than my previous Kindle Fire. I'm very happy with it.
Easy to use, was worth the $50. Wish you could access google store with it but other than that, works great.
The device itself is funtional and gives you access to many types of services ex: netflix, hulu, amazon prime, and much more. It also allows you to customize it by side loading programs. Its not a bad little device but I prefer its big brother the amazon fire tv.
Purchased Fire TV while at Best Buy and this item was on sale. The Fire TV compared to the Fire Stick is much better.
Quality of kindle is pretty okay. Just wish charge would last more than 2 hours when child is playing games after being fully charged.
I purchased this for my brother in law who just needed something to surf the web. Set up was easy and he was on the internet within minutes of unboxing.
Nephew loved to play games and listen to music. He never puts it down. Very good buy.
This is an excellent price for the Amazon Fire 7 Tab, I highly recommend to product!
Echo was easy to set up. Works good. Wish it had more free music.
I am pretty impressed with this Amazon Fire tablet.I've had many iPads over the years, currently have an iPad Air 2, and this Fire tablet is very nice.Great screen, very responsive, lots of options, reliable wifi.I can't believe this thing only costs 50 bucks!This may replace my iPad.
Great product for intro to an AI device. Cant wait to upgrade to echo.
Its ok but the chargers brake easily but overall its the best
Small enough to make it portable, a lot faster then the Stick.
Now with multiroom syncing available, I love it even more.
I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker and this was perfect. I think in order to get the full benefits its best to be a prime member so you can link your account and use prime music but also be able to utilize the tools like shopping list, checking past orders, etc. the only downside is it's not wireless. I know Amazon has made one that is wireless but I like the design of the echo.
Gift for my parents, easy for them to use! They loved it!
I like Alexa but I wish it had driving directions.
doesn't allow for my apps but with memory card it will.
I personally has Kindle vovage. Paperwhite has flash on every page turn, which is bit not good reading experience
Endless number of titles to choose from at a very reasonable price. This e-reader is a great value.
Bought this for my cousins and he absolutely loves it.
It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most.
I got this for my two grandsons (ages 2 & 4) for Christmas. They love them.
Alexa is great. She plays music . She can answer questions and tell you the weather. I am still learning all that she can do .
Works for what hubby wanted it for. Will recommend.
Good for reading!Price ($90) is good, e-ink is good for reading.
We bought this to stream TV so we could cut our cable bill. Streaming live TV with Playstaion Vue and watching movies through Amazon Prime has worked well. We also have the less expensive Fire Stick and this product works much better.
The whole AI question and answer dynamic is cool, but the speakers are weak. The bass is non existent and the treble is harsh.
echo did as i expected sounds ok just have to be carfull of the name you end up calling
This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids.
Good sound, learns more as you use it, can tell reasonably corny jokes, and Amazon come up with a new app almost weekly. Future is great for it. Got it on sale......if I could get that price again, I might get another one.
I was able to nab this tablet for 40 bucks on sale and it's a great vacation tablet. There is a lot less pressure in losing this tablet and it fills all my basic needs of accessing Facebook, reading books, accessing internet and playing the occasional game. It's also the perfect tablet for the kids after purchasing a good case for it. 40 dollar tablet and they lose it? Drop in the bucket compared to losing/breaking a 300 dollar iPad.
It great daughter loves it! She loves how fast it is
It's a little different than most android devices but compatible with them. It was a very small (tiny) learning curve but if you are like me and using Amazon services like Kindle, Music, Audible or Prime then obviously the Amazon Kindle Fire was MADE with you in mind. Amazon Underground is great for kids as it's offering games that are otherwise paid or have in app purchases for the incredible price of absolutely free. It is amazing I don't know how they do that. I have a collection of games that would have cost me hundreds on my ipad. And there is the problem. You are going to have to buy one of these for you kids when they find out. Or you can install Amazon Underground on their own Android device.
All I have to do is speak, and I have music and news. It keeps me company.
From Out the Box she was Absolutely Wroth the Money, A perfect Addition to my Tech And Home!!!!
I need tablets that were cheap but had the processing speed that I needed to run certain apps. My children actually use them (I bought two because they were so cheap) and I have yet to have any problems. I love the individual profiles... Initally I didn't have any parental setting on there but my son quickly started purchasing books and such that he liked with my money.... Hence the individual profiles and limited access and a password on my profile. I'd recommend this product because of the price and functionality of the product. I love it and my kids do too.
Great streaming device based on Android which makes it somewhat customizable.
Great gift for a child that loves tech and loves to put apps on your phone.
This is great for an 8 yr old. She had out grown her Nabi and likes taking pictures this does just the trick. The memory can be extended to hold more pictures. Great tablet.
Many hours of fun and entertainment in using the Echo. Always interesting what Alexa will share with you.
Good and a lot of apps to pick from. And can connect straight to Internet
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
Surprisingly good and useful for the price. You really can't beat a $50 tablet. But remember, it still is a budget tablet. Tip: Adding anti-glare matte screen protector will great improve user experience and your interaction between finger and screen surface. Just like other budget tablets, Kindle Fire 7 lacks that coating finish on screen surface which will cause screen to attract smudges more than tablets with that coating.
This tablet was good enough for reading, check email and watch some movies on internet. It doesn't has a lot of option for free app as Samsung or Apple devices.
The echo works flawlessly and integrates with many online services that I use anyway. I love it and use it daily.
Absolutely love my Kindle fire. Would buy for friends and family. It is the perfect combination of a tablet and e-reader.
The kindle has a wide variety of ebooks that I thouroughly enjoyed taking on my adventures.
I love the overall design and feel of this Kindle specifically!!
It is a nice tablet for kids and my son enjoys it.
I bought it for my niece who is 7 seven years old. She loves it and she learns from the applications included.
I truly enjoyed it. I had it several months before buying an IPad.
I am using it from Nov'15 and have lots of apps and games installed it just never gets hang or slow up.
Great product for an age of streaming tv! Very little maintenance and setup
Love this. Had one for the living room had to get one for the bedroom.
The Alexa assistant is more accurate than Siri as well as very responsive.
Gave this to my wife for her birthday and she's very happy with it.
Nice tablet. I purchased this tablet for my mom as well as my daughter they both love this tablet. Good for general web surfing and loading books.
My family and I constantly use Alexa to listen to music, help with cooking, check the weather, help with homework and listen to the news. One of my favorite purchases ever.
I bought it for my nieces and nephews and they loved it.
Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet
Bought this for niece amd nephews. Was easy to set up and they loved it!!
Easy to use, battery life could be better, but does what's needed
Love the new features with the back camera however the screen is a bit small. Overall happy.
I purchased this kindle to replace one I had for several years. So far it has preformed great. Easy to use and holds a charge well.
Works as described. I really like the ease of use when it comes to the interface.
It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!
Got it for my kid after loosing the last one way better and faster.
Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
This is a great device. Sometimes not as fast as I feel it should be
this box does all it was said to do and more. It is a lot faster than the firetv stick I use when traveling. the 4K content looks great.
Love this product, and don't know why it took so l
The recharging port is not working consistently. I have tried other cables, so I know it's not the cable. Otherwise it works fine. I am looking forward to not having to charge it but once a week.
Super light, the paper white is a huge success and the battery life is as advertised. However, it is so light and small it mandates a protective case-BUT they are never in stock or otherwise available.
It's worked well, great value for the price, good speed, overall a good bang for the buck.
It is extremely light weight and easy to carry around. Great resolution. I also purchased the protective cover.
This tablet disappointed me from the beginning. I loved my previous Fire tablet. However, this new one disappointed me from get go. I do not want it to tell me what I like or want! I do not like ads that pop up, I do not want suggestions for me on books, movies or anything else. I know what I like! I definitely do not want it talking to me! In this day and age, with identity theft prevalent, I would like to be able to have apps without having to turn on features like location, etc.. All in all, I am ready to bust it up and throw it away!
Satisfied with the quality but unlike iPad you have to purchase virus protection
Great stereo and back porch lighting! We use Alexa on our back porch when in our hot tub as a stereo and to turn our hue go lighting on. We also use her for hue lighting in the bedrooms and the hue lighting strips in the kitchen! You can also learn new Alexa skills on your iPhone every day. I'm 56 and it's super easy to learn how to use Alexa, you can too. :-)
Good tablet for simple use like reading books, music and simple tasks.
The tablet is a great value and resource for our 3 kids!
Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.
Great for a kids first tablet! Great for watching movies, playing games and reading books.
We recently purchased the Amazon Alexa and I love it! She can set an alarm, give sports updates, play music and my favorite tell jokes. I would definitely recommend.
For the price tag of $59 bucks u can't go wrong....
Perfect for kids to play, read online through wi-fi. Touch response is a bit slow.
This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.
This a great add on for non smart (older) televisions with a USB port.
I like my new tablet it's good on battery life and have fast response time when typing
I made this purchase for myself to free up space on my phone. Now I use it for books, movies and a lot more!
Great item. Price was good. Very happy with my purchase.
Works very well. Gave 2 for gifts. Would recommend buying this.
Very impressive. Works just as advertised. So very easy to set up
The Kindle is a great tablet for minor tasks and games or for a child. I haven't had it long, but I'm able to use it for what I bought it for, e-books for school.
This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended.
I love this thing. It gets used all the time in our house. It is so versatile and has so many possible connections. Only thing is, be prepared to spend more money on other things to pair with it.
The Fire Tab 7 is one of our favorite Tablets, and you can increase storage by adding an SD card. No reason not to get one unless you don't like saving money.
Nice, lightweight tablet for reading and occasional web surfing. Mostly used for reading.
Alexa just needs to better understand the questions asked.
I buy this tablet for my kid for Christmas he really like it
Great for children to play games and watch videos.
I love my tablet it is great for reading books and also playing games
I am satisfied with this purchase. It was cheap and good for my son.
Alexa really works. I was sceptical at first, now she is part of the family. I'm cooking , I have three different things on the go, microwave, stovetop, and outside on the grill; all need to be pulled off the heat at different times. No problem , I just ask Alexa to set timers for each item as I go along, awesome! Time to watch a movie now , " Alexa turn off living room lights " The lights dim and she confirms with "OK " - nice. A little bit too warm, " Alexa, set temperature to 69 " The air-conditioner comes on ,magical . My nephew does not like what we are cooking, " Alexa open Domino's " she asks for my order choice, within seconds Dominos has the order, paid for , arrives on time . This is truly one of the coolest devices I have ever purchased . I almost forgot, anytime I want to hear a piece of music that I loved from my past I just call it out and she can pull it up right there and then I can listen to it, in near Bose quality sound , Magic!!!!
This product is well made, durable and reliable. I have had good experiences with this manufacturer. I recommend this manufacturer and this particular product. This product does exactly what I need it to do. Super easy to use. I have used other manufacturers in the past but have not always been satisfied. I am happy with this product.
I left my 7 on airline flight and bought the 8 to replace love love the speed and the video on it. Glad I bought it is worth it!!!! the download speed has improved very much!!
We got this on a one-day special and took a chance. I would say that Alexa generally works better than Siri on most things and more consistently. The speaker alone is good, but the ability to play radio via TuneIN, Pandora, Amazon Music, etc. is value enough...beyond the little things like saying "Alexa, set a timer for 4 minutes" or "Alexa, what's the weather going to be like?". Overall very impressed with the Echo - recommended highly.
I had to go through 2 tablets before getting this one, which is the best that I have ever had.
Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product
Great and simple. Not being able to change master search engine beyond 3 offered was the ONLY negative I've experienced.
Love the product. And the place I would recommend them to everyone.
I purchased this device because I had the stick and I loved it. I knew this one has a faster processor, it would handle third party software better. I enjoy this product, it's really fun to use.
I needed something to control my home alarm and smart gadgets easily and this definitely covers it.
This is a great value tablet, great screen great apps. Highly recommend for media/games. I'll probably buy another
I bought the Kindle Oasis for my wife as a 37th-anniversary gift. She enjoys reading and I thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.
i purchased this in hopes of making my existing tv a smart tv, honestly i was kind of disappointed. for starters the remote quite a few times lost sync with the box and i had to download the fire tv app to reset the box. second it froze constantly in the middle of using amazon prime it would freeze up. now this might just have been the bad one in the batch, i dont know but i returned it and are looking for something different.
I put books on it and read them. That's pretty much it
Really good, does what is described. Was at good price.
Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. Is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.
Gave this as a gift to my sisters family. They love it. My brother in law isn't a computer user so he loves just being able to ask questions instead of having to "google" things.
I bought two Amazon Fire tablets for my two boys. They love it. It is so easy for them. Great for netflix and app games. And its fast.
I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where
A friend at work mentioned this product and told me that it is pretty decent for movies. I am amazed at just how much content you can access on this fire tv box. If you like to watch tv; movies, cable series and play games you can't go wrong with this purchase.
Fantastic product at An affordable price and fast delivery
well worth the money, it's just a pretty well thought out tablet, the interface is designed well enough for a child to a grandmother to use with relative ease.it's also powerful enough to play a great variety of fun, good looking games. which is pretty amazing at this price point.
Alexa is great. Able to listen to xm radio no problem.
It's my only access to television these days. All I need is a wifi internet connection to the house. I have thoroughly enjoyed using it. It works great.
I loved it and then bought 2 of the dots for my daughters
The Amazon Tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device. A few things to note if you're not familiar with the Tap or haven't seen it in person:- It's roughly the size of a glass of water- By default, you do have to press the microphone button to talk to Alexa, but as of an update released on Feb 17th, 2017 there is an option in the Alexa app to make the Tap always listen without pushing the button (at the expense of battery life)- The speaker grille is not metal, though it looks like it in pictures. It's a mesh fabric, similar to what you'd feel on the end of some speaker grilles and micrphones. It's firm and comfortable to hold, but if you push hard enough it does flex. - Using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock, as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case.- You can charge the Tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro USB cable (one is included) into the back of the speaker.
This tablet is a great economy tablet for personal use (reading or watching movies). It's great gift idea as well.
This makes for a great house warming present for anyone who loves tech! Definitely want to buy one for myself.
Out of all the other media sources, this is my favorite one. It's a lot user friendly, and has more options to do things with this media device.
I got this for my wife to use in her sewing room along with our Amazon Prime Music membership.The sound quality is about the same as a good quality bluetooth speaker and fills the room nicely. And it's great just asking for music and having it play!
Amazon Echo is great!! Easy to set up and use in your home.
Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark
I am extremely happy with my Kindle Fire. The price was fantastic. Functionality is great. I am very pleased with this tablet
Love the screen; very easy on the eyes compared to other electronic devices. This this can handle some drops and a little bit of water too; i;m glad that it's tough.
Small with a lot of sound. It works perfect in my home
I can't use until I can get the webroot installed...I tried a geek but they wanted $40 to do it...I only paid that much for the tablet. Print is so small I can barely read it...there is probably an adjustment to font size but I don't want to get online without the webroot protection.
Bought for my 9 years Granddaughter, she loves it.
For the price you can't beat it. Camera isn't the best as for zooming in but it takes good picture's. I also long the storage expansion
The best item I have ever seen in my life and so glad I found this item....:)
Easy to set up Plays movies from Amazon Prime with no problem Great tablet for the price
I love the hands free feature of the Amazon Echo. The speakers are great and the music sounds great on it. My main reason for getting It was to listen to music but it does so much more!
Same great reliable tablet as the three other Fire 7" tablets I purchased previously for my kids. Now we can actually tell them apart! The tablets, I mean.
I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
I purchased this because I wasn't sure how a tablet would work for me, and wanted to buy an inexpensive "starter." I was quickly sold on the convenience and ease of use. The ads are a minor issue - they go away with the swipe of a finger! I'm able to watch tv and movies, access the internet via Wi-Fi, play games, and send email with ease. (Be aware - this tablet does come with a 30-day trial of Amazon Prime, and if you don't cancel before the end of that trial, it automatically enrolls you.)
Good ereader if you only want to download books. Easy to download from my local library and Amazon.
I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use.
My brother told me about this product. I bought it for my son and he loves it.
Works as good as the original
It's very entertaining and provides instant information.
Amazing product I bought 2 one for me and wife we read alot of books so perfect and the selection is great books a must buy.
For home automation this thin really does it it can do a lot of things and also is very simple to use.
I purchased this as a gift for a friend who really just wanted to have a device to play games. It was perfect for him. He can do so much more with this tablet. It is a great tablet for the price!
Got these for my 4 and 11 year old on Black Friday when they were 34$. Typically our household is Apple only. But I couldn't justify buying another iPad. Works great. Not as many of her favorite apps as the iPad but still a hit.
Great sound! Amazing device! Nothing but good things to say about it.
What can I say? The Amazon Fire is a great tablet . The price is fantastic . Good size . Does the job . Great deal at Best Buy
No idea as I haven't opened it up yet. I bought it for my non smart TV and as a potential replacement for Xfinity cable box. From the reviews, it should work fine for what I intend to do with it.
We purchased two Paperwhite's and gave one to our daughter. So far so good.
We love Alexa!! We play music and the quality is outstanding.
Bought this for my niece and it works great. Access to all the apps she likes and easy to use.
I like it the echo works good to, I am going to buy another
Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.
Alexa is a helpful tool to use everyday. She gets better the more skills you have her learn.
My mom bought this for my sister, she loved it. Great gift!
I purchased 2 one for my wife the other for my college aged daughter both are enjoying the product immensely !
I purchased the Kindle fire about three weeks ago and rarely pick up my iPad anymore. It is a great reading device with the flexibility of allowing you to access many other basic applications. I carry it with me practically all the time.
I had used Roku, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV and Smart TV's digital feed. This device does the heavy lifting effortlessly, at $100.00 price point and allows the versitility of android tv customization.The Apple and Android Smart Phone Remote app trumps all the others.Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner.
This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.
I bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it.
Alexa is wonderful to have-I love asking it questions and listening to my favorite songs.
I bought one of these for myself and another for my sister. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase, it's an overall good value. The OS is very clean and simple to navigate and based on android. I was able to install the Play store without rooting the device by simply installing the apks. Overall it works great with Amazon apps and those I've installed from the play store. The sound quality is fair though the one speaker is a little low at times. Screen quality is good, not HD but decent. The most lackluster part of the tablet is the front facing VGA and non-auto focus rear cam -- I was unable to scan some barcodes with the rear camera. However, at this price point you get a lot for your money. I especially like the amazon underground apps that are totally free and add to the value of the tablet.
We are having a blast with Alexa, eventually we will grow our Alexa's family...i.e.: lights, tv... we are becoming so lazy... wish she would clean the house too... :)))
Bought it for my brother and he absolutely loves it!
Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it!
Great Device! Quick, easy to use and a great value!
I love this tablet it works great. A great fit for me
Alexa is fabulous. Just ask her anything and she will answer right away. She can order a pizza, turn on your lights and order an uber. Better than a secretary.
The Fire is a great tablet for beginners. It is easy to use and it works perfect for me.
Setting up the device for my sons profile took a litthe more time than I expected, but I love it. It's easy to navigate and has a ton of preloaded activities for him.
This helps me stream a lot of channels but not have to get expensive cable
The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
The Amazon TV box is much better than the stick due to the high quality of resolution that it gives you. You can now have all the apps you need and use thru the Amazon box.
I'm loving my kindle. Early gift to myself. Happy!
Great for things I need it for and is easy to store and put in my purse
The fire TV is a nice upgrade if you have the fire stick. Its fast and has expandable storage. Best for TVs with high resolution.
It seems to work just like any other usb plug in charger.
Perfect Tablet for our Son we bought it for his 9th Birthday it works great and he couldn't be happier great Tablet.
I was skeptical at first but really enjoy all the features
For the price that I paid, 35 dollars, it is more than enough. the best is the front and rear camera.
Love using my new tablet (Amazon Fire). Easy to use.
Lights, timers, grocery's, Alexa, Echo's voice service does it all and more. Voice recognition is amazing, from across the room, when music is playing it works. Built in speakers are very good (on a Bluetooth speaker level). Setup is easy with the free App. select what "skills" you want to activate to customize Echo to your home, (skills are Alexa's ability's). More and more integration into home automation weekly, Alexa already controls select lights, switches, thermostats, even integration with some cars (start car remotely, how many miles remain before refueling). What could be easier then using voice commands that work and simply asking questions to get information?
Alexa is very responsive to questions, requests, and plays music. Also works as an alarm clock. And plays games.
Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price.
Perfect little tablet ., inexpensive and perfect size for what I need..
Bought this for my friend. Very happy with this and asked for another one for his friend :)
I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8" model so much that she continued using it after the 11" one returned.
Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
My only comment, the pre installed apps cannot be removed. I purchased the 8GB model. Only about 2 GB of storage available.
Bought this tablet for my grandmother and rooted it to remove all the amazon ware on it. She isn't technologically savvy but has loved playing with this tablet and is becoming a youtube expert. Can't go wrong for the price.
Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight
Best Buy employees could have been more knowledgeable on this item
My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.
Amazon-Fire was instrumental in providing us a quality HD picture to our TV!
I was told by my wife to buy these as a gift for the kids.
This tablet is so easy to use for all ages. Already comes charged & ready to use.
Really enjoy the interface and how integrate with the amazon music service .....great
I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
Works great indoors & out. Very light weight & easy to carry, even in a pocket. Amazon downloads are easy & quick.
With so many program choices available with Amazon Fire Stick, why would you want cable? Cable is just too expensive. This is a much cheaper alternative to cable.
Awesome experience...my friend Chris Fields works at BB...I went in for 1thing & with Chris there, I bought 4 items. Extremely helpful.. I'll shop more now coz he can answer any of my questions. I adore BB.
bought for child , great gift love the item would recommend it
Love listening the music. Great to be able to get my weather forecast for the day!
My son loves this tablet. I love how you can regulate the time spent on this and control what your kids do on it.
Love it. You can read without diestraftions of notifications as you would from your phone.
My other kids have a tablet like this one and my youngest wanted one. They all love having their own and really like these. They were not a bad price either.
Great product and good customer services. The person I met in the store explained me all the features.
Glad to get the geek squad back. The tablet is great, best gift I could have gotten
Friends who have Amazon Prime were delighted to have the Amazon music library as well as all the other services at voice command. With the Amazon app on the smart phone they got shopping lists and many other linked services. It was the "best gift ever."
I read a lot, check emails and shop, that's all I want and need from a tablet and this one is awesome!
She can do all kinds of things with this, especially with all the skills we can enable in Amazon!
Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.
nice and easy-to-use for a 3 yr old ..............
One of the best purchases I have bought. I love this speaker and all the things it can do
Excellent gadget, a little tricky in the beginning to setup the commands, but once you got it, everything goes well
Bought it for my brother and he just loves it also the price is very reasonable. Highly recommended if you just need a regular tablet
Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Great value for the money
My wife is an avid reader and loves the Kindle. She has tried other tablets but none are as good as the paperwhite Kindle. This is the one she carries in her purse to pull out read during waits for doctors.
Brought for grandmother as a Christmas gift because she wanted and iPad and we. Thought she'd never figure out how to use one so I bought this as a beginners tablet and she loves it
Bought it to read and I couldn't resist the great price.
Not a bad tablet if u like reading. If u prefer AOSP and customs Android OSes I suggest the Nexus 7
I had purchased a fire stick before I purchased the fire tv and it would freeze up and crash after long usage fire tv runs great.
I have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own "Silk Browser," which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. It may take some folks a some time to get use to Amazon's OS, but it should not take very long to do so.
I like the echo, but too much to look up with the skills.
The Fire Tablets are by far the best value on the market. They are parent friendly with the parental controls and kid friendly with he ease of use.
This is my second Kindle as I updated from a previous model. This is lighter more comfortable to hold and the internal light is amazing.
great everyday simple web surfing and apps on this tablet for the price. Good to used it on the plane and watch movies or videos. Processor not as fast as your premium ipad.
good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.good.
This tablet proves a great value for browsing the web, storing photos and using Amazon. The sale price is truly hard to beat!
The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does, but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker. You do need to tap it to ask Alexa to do anything, but otherwise it works the same as Echo. I prefer the Echo, but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.
Pros:Great value for moneyEnough power to handle lot of Android gamesDecent battery lifeCons:Feels slow after using for a few weeksLow-resolution screen and camera.
Amazon makes this tablet a no brainer. The performance and price are unmatched by any other tablet on the market. As and entry level tablet with all the entertainment extra Amazon offers, it is a great deal.
I'm was so pleased with this tablet, I bought a second one for my father. We both love it.
can not down load any apps from goggle play, didn't know amazon and goggle don't have agreements to sharge
Bought this for a 3 year old great for kids for games and movies
I've had a lot of fun using Alexa. Have even laughed at some of the things we've done with it!
Cool that you can link Bluetooth and the Echo and it is a great speaker! Neat features. Alarm clock and timer too. Definitely recommend it.
Tablet is great for my 7 and 14 year old. They love it.
Compared these headphones to beats. Satisfied with the purchase!
Best e reader yet ! The new voyage is much better then the first Paperwhite which was great !
I would highly reconmnd this product to anybody. I use it on a daily basis
It is a gift for my friend. She is really like it and said she is start to enjoy reading now.
I can say it does recognize every accent, but there were too many questions unanswered.
I bought this as a Christmas present for my 12 year old niece. She loves it. She is consistently checking her facebook and playing games from all the apps. SHe a loves it.
Bought the fire for a reader as a gift. My daughter in laws loves it.
Got it on sale, works well but it's a bit slow when buffering.Overall we like it.
Maybe I didn't give it enough time. I had it a few weeks before I returned it. I just didn't feel the love. I see a lot of potential. I was wanting to control some of my WIFI connected devices like my thermostat, TV, and some lighting. but it took a lot of programming to get it there. So maybe after they do the heavy programming for outside devices then I'll try it again.
The connectivity was okay to setup for access the navigation was a little clumsy. Overall good product for a good price in it's category.
Alexa has mad our lives easier. It controls almost everything in our household.
Nice tablet for media consumption for the price. For Amazon user for sure
I haven't used it yet because it is attached to my other tv set. but I'm sure i will be please with my purchase.
She loves it! Uses it for everything! She gets her homework done on it as well!
I bought it for my 4 year old nephew. He is able to use it with ease. Its a great product for the pirce
It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
You need to find the correct way to ask questions or you will not get good answers. Otherwise I like this item
Alexa had been entertaining for the whole family. I really like the weather app, timer and news updates. The kids love playing music on demand. They are 5 and 3. It has also been a good way to teach sharing.
This new kindle is so much easier to read than my second generation kindle that I had for years. It is faster, and the back-light can be adjusted easily to get the right amount of light for your reading pleasure. If you love books, you should get this.
Amazon continues to excel and lead in this technology
Whole family has there own and we all love them no matter what we want to do
I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
I love this little tablet! I can do all my school work on it. Great value.
Its a simple tablet, but works great, good picture, you can do most the same as other major named tablets.It works for me.
Was hesitate to order this because I thought it might be difficult to hook up. Step by step instructions from the app and the echo was so easy to set up. Volume is spectacular!! Amazing what you can ask Alexa...still learning and playing. Love it so much I ordered another dot for the bedroom.
The tablet its self seem a little slow. But for the price and it being got my kids, totally acceptable
Realy good tablet for a great price can't go wrong
A steal for a tablet to surf the internet or control automation
Love it and works pretty good for what i wanted for
Does the job
Bought this as a gift for my niece and she loves it. Works well, is very user friendly even for a 10 year old and was priced as what I feel was a very good value. I would recommend.
No wife loves reading books on it. It's a good size
Bought the voice fire stick, that is a nice feature. The ease of navigation in the apps is nice because of the streamlined interface. I am happy with the buy.
The Echo responds surprisingly well to my commands. Great for music on Prime and Pandora
Granddaughters Christmas gift. She loves it & the external micro SD slot enables her to download a bunch of stuff.
we got this for my dads girlfriend this year for christmas and she was able to just start using it right away. it is a bit akward to hold since it is so long but its not too bad. compared to my tab s2 it is pretty close when it comes to responsiveness. if you want something that is very easy to use and you dont mind the amazon marketplace constantly trying to insert ads and sell you things this is an awesome tablet that can actually have some of that stripped out if you know what to do and how to do it.
It would be nice if it had a text list of books, like my old kindle. The cover graphics are too small to read. This is the only reason for four stars, and not five. Other than that, I like this better because of the great resolution and contrast, as well as the built in LED's for reading at night.
I tried the Roku but the Fire TV was just more flexible and the menu was easier to navigate.
Great if sharing between kids. You can set up a timeframe for each of how long they should be on it
Excellent e-reader, with great download ability. I really do not need the 3G as most of my downloads are through my PC.
Amazon makes a great tablet unbelievable that it only cost $50 bucks. The processor lags just a little bit but other than that everything about this tablet I love.
I love it, Alexa usually know most of the answer, worth the money
This was bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it very much. She uses it every day and it helps her relax. I am so happy that we found something she enjoys so much. It's screen is a good size and doesn't hurt one's eyes. It is easy to flow through the apps on the tablet. Thanks...
This is a name brand tablet for less than the case of other tablets! This is a no brainer and will make great Christmas gifts!
I was a bit skeptical at first about purchasing this device over a Roku. I am so glad that I did. Even though I have cable tv I end up watching this device for movies and other entertainment more then cable tv. Everything loads super fast.
Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
this was a present for my fifteen year old grandson,it was new as described, fast shipping, and he is happy with it.
Was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone (doesn't need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our Echo Dot), but was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume! We prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker, and its "Hands-Free" mode is a great updated feature (though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster)...
Wonder product! Really enjoying it setup was easy and the sound is wonderfully loud
I integrate Alexa to my control4 animation system and afte program few command I lover her even more
Did a good bit of research for the fire tv. Bought the stick first, had several operating issues. Unit would buffer then freeze up. The unit got real hot. Returned the stick for the fire tv box. Have not had any of the same problems. Saving over $100 a month cutting out cable. So paid for itself, definitely a great decision.
for the price it is worth it... for below usd50.00 you get a decent tablet
The Amazon Echo has been a fun edition to our home electronics. I like playing Jeopardy everyday. Listening to music. The speaker has a great sound. A handy item to have around.
My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.
I love this table because I can monitor everything my kids download!!! Watch!!! Use!!!! I can control everything!!! Best investment!!!
Decided to spend the extra money to get the model with more processing power for games. Other than the occasional heating up and the unit freezing, it serves its purpose
It was by far the best deal out there for the money very happy
I replaced an older Kindle with a new paper white version. What a super improvement.
great idea will recommend to everyone just can't stop playing with it
Had the fire stick but I just bought a 4K tv and upgraded the Netflix to stream 4K. Loved the fire stick so much only made sense to buy the fire tv box. It's super easy to use. Great interface.
Amazon replaced it as it had gray stripes and no picture on the screen. That one works so overall the Fire was a good purchase. Recommend a memory card, it does not hold much.
Bought this for my 78 year old mother who had recently broken her wrist. She absolutely loves it! She is reading all the time. Light enough she can hold it with one hand.
1of fav chargers
I really enjoy the kindle fire.It is easy to use and fast.
Kindle fire is an awesome tablet for reading, browsing..Color is amazing
Fire TV is an awesome tool easy to use and designed to be quick, light, and filled with options.
Just got this as a Christmas gift and it doesn't stand.. Nothing to secure it to make it stand.. You can get it to stand maybe to watch a video, but don't touch it. It will fall down easily. Certainly don't stand it and actually use your Fire HD6 with this cover.. You can't.. Falls right over. I feel really badly for the special person that bought me this. Waste of money. I had already bought my own cover, for a lot cheaper, that has more shock protection and that one won't stand on end, but at sits securely at a tilt which makes it more useful for me. The cheaper one I bought on Amazon also has a magnetic closer to the cover stays closed. This one does not. Not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that I don't like this one at all. I'll feel bad telling them, and they'll feel bad hearing it. Bad all around.
This is the best affordable streaming player. Easy to use, and the voice remote just adds to the experience.
Great speaker sound and ease of setup. Works great with Amazon music option.
Excelent tablet for kids, easy to use and good parental protection
it just works. I use it to control lights, thermostats, listen to radio/podcasts/music and set timers/alarms.
I have two Apple I-Pads that my students and I use in my third grade classroom. I've wanted one for home use but didn't want the expense. This Amazon Fire tablet does just about as much as my school Apple I pads but at less than a quarter of the cost. The amazon fire tablets are smaller but easy to use and amazingly fast loading! wish i had one for each student!
Works great! Easy to setup and has great parental controls.
The Echo is amazing and has already changed how we enjoy our home! From asking Alexa to turn on the lights in the morning to looking up the star of the movie that we are watching The Echo is a valuable asset to our family. I am going to purchase the Dot and we just added a Tap to complete our Smarthome.
Absolutely love this device. Way better than kindle app on iPad or on droid phone.
Great tablet for the price. Surfs Web well.great for her to watch netflix on
Amazon added ads to this less expensive tablet. Annoying
Great tablet with good parental controls for kids!!
As inexpensive as this tablet is, it is a great option for children. Each of my kids has one. If they damage it, you aren't out a ton of money like an iPad. Freetime is also a great option to help control apps and time each child is on the kindle.
Really good Christmas gift. Would recommend to anyone
This tablet is for my mom who only knows the basics of technology. You can play games on it and social networks easily. Anything more advanced I wouldn't recommend. Great product starter tablet for am amazing price.
Perfect, thanks.
Ok but I wouldn't go to the trouble of buying this again. All I get is the weather and some music and it's really a waste of money and time. Even though Siri is slow at least serious with me all the time and this rests on my desk or on the table top and that's about it
This is easy to set up and what I really like is with the Ethernet connection there's rarely buffering
My husband and I each own this Kindle. You will never find us without them at hand for gaming or email. My bff always complained that I was addicted. Guess what I got herfor a birthday present! So who's the addict now!
The Amazon Fire is a perfect buy and at a great price! What my son loves best about the Fire is that it has a camera (the older version does not). I would highly recommend this the Fire!
My 4 year old son got this for Christmas and he loves it
Great Product to use with a Non-Smart TV or a Smart TV which is not compatible with Amazon Music.
Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life.
I had the Fire Stick, ran OK did what I need to do but was slow, then I got this and it runs like a champ. plus a big factor why I wanted this was to Ethernet Port.
So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
The kindle was a graduation gift for our son who was going to travel with friends for a month. He usually fills his backpack with a ton of books, which he is reluctant to leave behind once read. This really lightened his load and he loved being able to read in all light conditions
If you like to read and travel this is the answer to that problem. You can read just about any paper in the country at any time.
Very easy to use and navigate. Perfect size to carry in my purse and still a good sized screen to watch movies.
This is a good product for books only. The apps and other things are not like an iPad. Very clunky, slow......However, the kindle is better than an iPad for book reading. It is lighter, the interface with Amazon is seamless and you can say download a sample of 40 pages for free before deciding to buy it, which is a huge plus !!
I bought this for my kids, 5 and 9. I wanted to get them a tablet but still restrict what they could do. This tablet has fantastic parental controls. I opted to include the FreeTime membership and that puts them into a kid-specific app center where they just click and play without the visible hassle of downloading, fees, and ads. It's been very sturdy with the 5 year old. Overall I am extremely satisfied for a kids tablet. Not sure I would buy one for me personally, but great for kids.
use it for taking pictures of family for memories.
I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.
I find Alexa to be extremely useless at times. It's a chore trying to search for specific music through Amazon's music list (this is trying to find common songs played on the radio currently)
Easily accesible wonderful for my kids stays charged long time
This is a very nice small and an inexpensive tablet.
This is great for kids. My niece loves her new fire kids edition.
I absolutely love my amazon fire it is very user friendly. I bought one for my parents and used theirs so much I decided to buy one for myself as well.
My kids love these tablets. They have a very easy operating system! Very user friendly!
Perfect for a graduation gift when you are unsure of what the person finds interesting.
One of the worst purchases or investments you could make for technology.
Nice sturdy case. Good way to start children on tablets.
Excellent just 50$ , and has all the features and a vast collection of books
The best product name on the market,no doubt about it.
Voice recognition has come a long way. Really amazed at how well it works.
I love that this tablet came preloaded. All we needed to do was charge it and my child had access to many books at an appropriate level.
Amazon Fire works very well for my family. It is a great time for family to watch movies together
I think the kindle is the best value for the money, this is my third. Each model gets better than the last, I'm loving my 10.1. Comfortable to use does everything I need and beautiful video.
This is a basic tab. I bought this for my sister. You can't really do anything much on this unless you have an amazon account and you have to buy a prime membership which is expensive. But I was still able to use it for games and internet browsing. I had difficulty using it for anything more. Camera was not the best.
Font and lighting options enhance readability. Light weight and durable.
This is a excellent item for kids. And better then spending 100+ for another tablet.
The Echo is truly amazing. Want the weather forecast, the time, listen to music, set a cooking timer? Alexa does it all for you. It does many things - you just have to explore on line to fully utilize the Echo. I'm sure that 10 years from now every home will have an Echo!
I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!
The Amazon fireTV is a good Roku replacement. It does push Prime and Amazon fee based content, but the Fire TV is smooth and has some nice features like Alexa (when you push the microphone button on the remote), free games, and voice search. Overall, it's a pretty cool product.
Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
This is a great starter tablet. Does all the basic things and is only $50. Not gonna find a better one for this price. In this price range your not gonna find a faster one. Get an SD card and you can put stuff on the card eliminating the one weak point of the tablet, only 8 gig of memory.
Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.
I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription
Thought it would be fun to have one after reading the reviews. My alarm clock went south and I was shopping for a new one. Echo is a GR8 alarm clock GR8 timer + all the other amazing things it can do. It's just fun!! I have 2 Echos and 1 Echo Dot when I say play everywhere the whole house is full of music of my choice!
I was tokd if you had wfi there would be no problem to make it work. Wrong, I already gave it to the person and they cannot make it work, they do not have a smart phone, but have computer and wifi... Im afraid I will have to return the item.
I was looking at several streaming devices and decided on the Amazon Fire TV. It was a great choice. The device is very fast and has no lag at all. It works great streaming 4k content from Amazon and Netflix to my LG 4k TV. I would highly recommend this product.
I'm enjoying it and finding it to be good except it doesn't record.
Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable.
I really enjoy my kindle. My only issue with it is that I can't get some of the apps I normally use however it does have most of them.
It is perfect for everything I need to be able to do on the go.
Excellent product. Noticeably faster than the fire stick. I use it with my Tablo DVR, SlingTV, and Kodi. With this there is nothing else you will need.
I have really enjoyed using the Amazon Echo so far. It has a great sound.
I thought i wanted, but not sure as didn't know who had 1. Found out neighbor did - & saw how much easier it made things - no more note pads, can tell it to remind me about things etc. Perfect for my schedule
I'm so happy with my purchase. I use it mostly as a Kindle. It's a bit heavy to hold for an hour of reading. Proping it on my lap or a pillow solves that issue. It performs better than I expected for a $49 tablet . My wife returned her $800 iPad Pro after a week of comparing the two devices. Only 4 stars because of the weight and the home screen advertisements. Both are minor issues.
Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost.
son loves this he can do alot of things on it great quality for the price
Alexa is a must have in every home! Updates at a sound of your voice.
My wife thought tablet was to bright this more like reading book. Keeps charge alot longer and works with amazon prime. So this very good purchase at very good price!!!
Love it. never an issue, just like a computer but so much smaller and convenient.
Fire TV is a better option than the stick if you are either needing a wired Ethernet connection ( that's the fastest) or installing third party software like Kodi. The extra memory makes the menus much faster than the stick. It's an awesome product.
Kindle paper white is great. Easy to read with. Lightweight so you can throw it in your purse or travel bag & take it anywhere. I haven't had the chance to use it outside yet, but will when the weather warms up. Best gift I ever gave myself!
Purchased this as a gift for a first time tablet owner . They loved it ! Great product easy to use!
Love the ease of using them for our grandsons and they enjoyed them for Christmas
I just use it as a new phone charger for my android, you need to buy this if you buy a Kindle because the USB they come with doesn't have this attached.
This is a great tablet for the price. Great for traveling!
It was a good tablet really easy for kids with great security
i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it
Easy to use and can't complain about the price. Able to watch Netflix and surf the internet easily
We were not expecting more than what we got in terms of performance but good enough for simple browsing and videos.
I purchased this tablet for a 6 yr old and it is very easy for him to use.
Got it for my wife and she loves it. Very convenient for travel.
But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up.
I like the fact you can talk to the device. More convenient than the others.
if you don't already have a smart tv -this is the way to go - Amazon has so many more choices than Netflix plus Prime gets you free shipping on top of free movies
This tablet is way more than expected! I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter to play minecraft on and she hasnt complained yet!
verygood low end tablet rivals some of the more expensive. does everything it says.
We use this everyday of the week. All the options it has makes it perfect for everyone. Setup was easy as is using it. Everyone should have one.
Absolutely love this thing! It controls my lights and works as a fantastic alarm clock. This thing has plenty of awesome features. It's basically Jarvis in my house
Battery wouldnt hold a charge but was able to get it teplaced.
This tablet is so compact and fit in my purse. It works very well.
Easily the best one of the various kindles I have had.
This thing is super fun to play with. Its amazing how microsoft, apple, or google didn't come out with something like this before Amazon of all companies did. Works incredibly well
I am a senior citizen who is not that great on computers or tablets, therefore, I need a book to help me understand how to do things on the tablet. I could not believe that this tablet did not come with an instruction booklet. It's taking me some time but I am learning how to get around this thing. That's why I can only give this product 4 stars instead of 5.
This is my second paper white and I am very satisfied
I purchased two of these for my kids since they both wanted tablets for Christmas. We liked that they could use it like their own but we had total control of what the used and viewed. It is a lot faster than the older Kindle. It is pretty durable as well.
I purchased this device as a dedicated reader with the occasional web browsing and video streaming and I am very happy with it for that purpose. It is the right size and the right weight. The Amazon case (sold separately) gives it a real book feel. If you are looking for more multi-purpose use, you may find this device frustrating - especially if you have invested in Google's ecosystem. The device runs on Fire OS - Amazon's flavor of Android - and app purchases are made through Amazon's app store. Google Play store and Google Services are not available on this device, and the most essential Google apps (e.g. YouTube) are not available in Amazon's app store. That said, it's still an excellent device for this price point.
Purchased for my 3 year old grand daughter, she LOVES it.
Excellent product with decent sound and form factor.
It is small enough to carry along on my daily routine. The price was right too.
Alexa is very easy to use. I just plugged it in, downloaded the companion app, and was surprised how much it could do with a few voice commands. I highly recommend it for beginners in home automation devices. The more I use it, the more intuitive it becomes. I am going to purchase one for my 86 yr old mother too.
I was impressed how good this tablet is for the price that i paid. Really good tablet for the kids.
Simple and straightforward. No set up necessary. Reading with this Fire is a breeze. Lightweight, holds a charge well.
this speaker is amazing and alexa is a perfect friend
Step son wanted a tablet and nowadays kids are up to date on technology so the kid friendly tablets weren't enough for him. Perfect for kids when iPads are way too expensive for a first tablet
Perfect tablet for kids, they love it, easy to use
It fine. I wasn't aware of what I was purchasing at the time but thought that I would need it in order to charge my book. Turns out I have several of them already from other electronics. Didn't really need it.
You find may uses for Echonfrom news flash to adding appointments to you calendar.
A Must Have!! Super helpful and convenient. Big time saver and all around fun!!
Awesome voice recognition. Great buy even if sole use is as a speaker. Great sound.
I am so happy I chose the Echo over the Google. Clear sound, listens better than google. More knowledgable than google, answers all questions correctly.
In my opinion the fire tv is definitely one of the best streaming devices out there with its awesome performance and easy to use.
I got it for my daughter who really loves it, it is very easy to use
Easy-to-use experience and the things I've able to do over my old kindle
love this tablet! has a lot of apps for free and great hd screen
This fire tv is an excellent streaming device. One of the best things about it is it is able to stream 4K big upgrade over the fire stick if you have a 4K tv. Also the micro sd card slot is nice to have. It is also very compact. The one thing you will need to pick up is an HDMI cable it doesn't come with one.
I have one in every room. It does everything from playing music, getting info and I use it for an alarm clock.
easy to use and has enough space. I highly recommend this product. Also a great gift
I love the kindle voyage. My favorite feature is that I can read while at the beach!! It's also very lightweight and fits in one hand.
Got this for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it.
Works great, several apps for my kids to choose from.
This awesome little device is perfect for everyone. It has an expandable storage which allows you to add personal photos and videos to the Amazon Fire TV box. It's perfect for traveling especially when staying in hotels as you can watch subscribed programming anywhere. I recommend this product to everyone.
Great product! I will recommend this to all of my family and friends.
This tablet is a great price and perfect for kids, however the picture quality could be better
Really like the voice commands, including commands outside the typical, movie/tv expectation (like the weather). Haven't used it as much as i thought i would, but set up (for the things i want to do) is fair....
Got rid of DirecTV and purchased an Amazon Fire TV. We stream video every night and the picture quality is incredible. Just make sure that your internet speed is able to keep up if you want to watch in HD. Nice to be able to cut the cord, save some money and not sacrifice picture and sound quality
I purchased this for my son & daughter-in-law for Christmas. It had to be returned as it would not sync. They got another one and have not had any problems that I know of.
Love it for the ease of using it and for the books I can read on it. Great buy!
Works well but too much advertisements with little control over content.
Bought this tablet as a gift and I might end up buying one for myself.
It is easy to use.. very convenient. I am glad I bought it.
Love it and would recommend it for the young as the old
I like the kindle 8 very much. I enjoy all the additional options it provides as well as the ease of using it. It will provide me with ability to be in contact with family and friends while on vacation.
Purchased it to watch/stream movies and tv shows on Amazon. Wish I would had bought the 4K fire stick. This is still a good stick!
great device still needs little quirks worked out to be the device that i truly want it to be but overall great speak and it does its job
This is a good little device. Well worth the money. Facebook is hard to read but overall a good product.
The product is good just the speaker came blown...
This tablet is so awesome and my Niece's and Nephew love theirs
We love Alexa!!! Awesome speaker! We have recommended to many friends and family!
Super convenient. Battery life for weeks. Perfect for morning train commute.
This cover is made for the Kindle DX and fits it beautifully. The problem - and it's a big one - is if you accidentlly try to open the cover from the back (which is very easy to do) you can damage the Kindle without even realizing what's happened. My husband did this and cracked the Kindle frame within the first week of owning the device. Fortunately, only the frame was cracked and the Kindle still works. We cannot, however, remove the cover because of the way it hooks into the device, the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back cover. After the incident, we attempted to clip the back cover to the Kindle, but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place. We are just extremely careful now, but the damage was done almost immediately. I hope this design flaw has been fixed.
This tablet is easy to use and it connects to my Wi-Fi easy as well.
A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device
Love this much more than cable tv. Children really enjoy it too.
I was hesitant to upgrade from my original firestick to this, but I'm glad I did. It works much faster and smoother. Well worth the money.
So far so good. Didn't like the setup, but once got thru that everything is good.
One of the best investments ever. Work great with all the streaming apps.
Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way!
this box is definitely better than the fire stick. if you have amazon prime and Netflix you don't really need cable with this box.
Kindle is the best. In this version, storage and resolution screen has been improved.
Love being able to read outside in full sun. Adjustable backlight for reading at night, great for the car or in bed.
I use my Fire to read, play games, browse, view Facebook, and much more. Great product for the price!
Alexa is the future. If you get a harmony elite remote you can control your Tv by voice. You can also control your hue bulbs. What a great toy!
Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price, I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too), the more than adequate specs (good enough screen, 1.5 GB of RAM, decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. Lastly, if you're deciding between the 7" and this 8" Fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead.
Purchased as a birthday present for my brother and was an upgrade for a previous model. I did not use is but he loves it.
This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
I am having a great time with Alexa and look forward to expanding her capabilities.
Love Alexa. I have 3 echoes now and 2 dots. I haven't played with them a lot but I love them. It's convenient to ask about the weather when you are getting ready for work or going out.
For reading, games, facebook, twitter, minor surfing the internet, this is a great device. It is small, but not so small as to be difficult to read. Fairly quick and dependable. For the price, it is hard to beat.
This is a nice little unit! Very portable and easy to read, or watch movies except in bright sunlight, it is easy to change the tablet light to not bother others in low light conditions
Good value for money. Light and convenient. Small and does not take up space!
My husband got one for his birthday and I'm the one that uses it the most, I have it paired to my spotify and I just ask Alexa for a song and she plays it for me. I get daily news, weather and I can shop on Amazon. Its awesome
It has all the features needed for my granddaughter and is easy to use. I'm am happy with this.
It works as advertised. I bought it as a gift so don't use it everyday.
Using this to add to the media capabilities of my TV. Works great..
Had to get to see what all the hub bub was about. The Echo as Texas Instruments chip and I work for TI
Got it on sale and it's good for what you pay for instead of paying a lot of money on an iPad.
The Echo is really cool. We use it to control the lights and listen to music all the time.
This tablet is a great beginner tablet. Amazing price! My child has used it over the last year with no issues. I'm buying another as a gift.
I love it. Great product.My son loves it. It is great for kids and adults.
I really love my Echo, love the voice controls and the ease of life now that ALexa is here.
I don't know how Amazon makes any money selling these. The quality is beyond what you pay.
This is a great alternative to an iPad especially for the price!! I would definitely recommend!!
Very useable device for the low cost. The screen is very bright and easy to read.
I got this for a cheap tablet and I love having it
This is one of the best streaming boxes I've had. Can easily interface it with kodi and also anything you may have on your kindle fire integrates as well. It's an awesome little box. Would purchase it again in a heartbeat.
easy to use. works great when you have an Amazon account
The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.
We haven't opened ours up yet, but a friend of mine has one and that's the reason we bought it. It's so much fun and easy to use.
Very easy to use and it is very convenient. Makes great gifts for anyone!
I purchased this for my daughter in the car. I didn't think I would like kids mode, but I hands found it to be useful. Amazon tweaked android and not for the better but it is still manageable. All things considered this is a cheap tablet but for a kid who cares.
This was a replacement for a Kindle Paperwhite that was lost. I did find the old one after buying a new one and now everyone in the family wants it.
This was purchased for my Kindle and I like it! Makes it easy to recharge it wherever I am. Recommend this product!
I AM LIKING IT SO FAR JUST FOR BASIC USE. READING AND SOME WORK VERY LIGHT. GOT A WIRELESS KEYBOARD TO GO ALONG WITH IT EASY TO CONNECT. NO problems very happy.
I love this kindle! My old one lasted about two years before it died so hopefully this one will hang in a little longer because I use it all the time.
I bought two for my kids for Christmas. They love it.
We love ❤️ it!! I just need some help and tips on how to work it!!
A steal of a deal on Black Friday and a great gift for young readers
love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service
I love the tablet . now i have time to catch up with my reading and tv shows and also facebook and magazines
Great product. As advertised. Very easy to set up profiles with daily goals and limits. Great purchase.
It's still confusing trying to figure out how to use Alexa and the app. To me, Alexa does not answer many questions at all or she does not understand many questions at all but I just need really be able to sit down and play around with the app. Is real funny though.
I have an iPad that I read books on. Unfortunately it's horrible to read on the beach, park or anywhere outdoors in sunlight. The kindle paperwhite is perfect for that.
Kindle is a dependable brand. I only trust iPad, kindle and a galaxy tablet. But none of their prices can ever match the value of the kindle
I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear.
Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
I use this tablet to control music on my surround sound home speaker system. It works great for that purpose. Streams directly to the receiver with no lag, and fits perfectly on the wall. Great device for this purpose
I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one.
Great for kids, my kids haven't stopped playing with it
She worked perfectly and helps out around the house hands free
This was my first Kindle, wonderful reading device.
I can go in this place and spend hours. Best prices and quality products.
This is a great product for someone who wants to switch from paper back books to electronic media. Great to read while outside or on the beach
Voice commands with Alexa is excellent. Home automation with Philips Hue is great.
Awesome tablet at a good price..I love the size of the tablet
It has everything we need so cable is not needed in this house!
Install was easy. Only issue was using it with PSVue.
Great gift for the family and friends. I have purchased several.
It's no iPad but for the price it can't be beat. Mostly use as e reader and the screen is excellent and perfect size for on the go.
Wanted to give my father another way to read his books or play his games without lugging around his laptop. He hasn't put it down since he was given it for Christmas. Easy to use and has a lot of options available for apps.
I thought this product would be a lot better than it is. It is not as smart as they say it is. It has a long way to go.
I was also skeptical about buying the Amazon echo because of the price. I was able to get mine on sale for $100. I wasn't sure how much I was gonna use Alexa. Turns out I use her everyday. From weather to traffic conditions on my commute. Alexa is quick and responsive. When she's paired with smart bulbs and other smart accessories it's really convient to have her. Alexa is easy to set up and worth the buy.
Easy to set up. The parental controls and safety features make this a great purchase.
I've avoided an e-reader as my tablet served well. When Amazon released this new Kindle Fire for $50, I thought, why not? I'm traveling a lot and it's nice and compact.Whoa! It also doubles as a tablet, as far as being able to access Internet, email, other things; the Amazon app (I can't remember the name, but it's pre-installed) has hundreds of free--yes, free--apps.I'm delighted to the point I've now purchased two more as gifts. I did add an SD card to increase storage space, but that was minor. Great product; excellent buy!
I like it. Works great and is so easy to set up and use with compatible products.
Wanted a cheap tablet to read books and comics. I found the lack of apps to be disappointing. It seems the tabelt is designed to make one buy books from amazon or to buy apps.
Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
Great beginner tablet for kids I would recommend it
The Echo is awesome and fun. We use it to control TV,s Thermostats, Lights, and Stereo all with voice commands. Anyone using amazon prime will like the voice ordering. We find something new everyday that the echo will do.
The backlight feature was what I was looking for for reading in the dark. Highly recommended.
No bells or whistles but does what I want for the price.
Great to give to the little ones so they don't break my phone. Found it at a great price and used rewards to bring the price down more.
My kids love it . I love the size and weight . It not easy to broke or crack
Got here quick, has a great speaker, and all the features are amazing and they keep adding more!
Didn't know how many lingering questions I had until I got an Amazon Echo. I mean, every little thing I want to know, I now just ask and hope Alexa knows. Very helpful to just get a quick answer to most things.
Incredible download speed bigger remote super responsive in selection Increased wifi range better bandwidth Definitely would recommend if you are in the market to buy a streaming media device
Bought as a gift for spouse. We are just beginning to explore the functions, but seems to have a lot of capabilities.
I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
Battery life is unreal! So much faster than my old kindle.
I have always enjoyed reading. I read to quickly and eventually spend a load of money on one book series. This product has already saved me at least $80, and i've only had it for a month. Yes I did the math! I love this thing!
It was a birthday present for a teenager. He carries it around and reads mostly on the kindle.
I have purchased a fire tab before for my wife. I would say it was the best consideration for a tablet. It lasted for a good time and I was really apprehensive from getting her one. It is durable in use, just don't go dropping it on cement. The only reason I gave a 4 star is because I haven't used it yet.
Great alternative to an internet connected/gaming tablet for a reading device for kids to use in bed at night.
the new kindle is a good, inexpensive 7" tablet with nice features and a good easy to use operating system. It is responsive and the screen has a good resolution. 8GB is adequate and the provided SD card slot allows you to increase your storage capacity.
Echo has a great speaker for sound and easy to program for music and radio stations Great product easy to use. Get daily news weather set alarm clock etc.
My 2 yr old loves his tablet. Best purchase ever. It has great educational videos and is easy for him to work on his kids profile. Amazon got it right!
Awesome for the price! Highly recommended for anyone looking for tablet. Easy to use.
My moth in law loved it. It was a great tablet for her!
Nothing all that special but does exactly what you want it to. Very easy to set up and use.
I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games.
This kindle replaces a previous model. The size is great, fits easily into purse or gym bag. The touch screen is a nice improvement over my earlier model. The backlit screen is good. Bright enough but not too bright. Overall, I am very pleased
A family member got the echo dot for their birthday and we played with it for a while and were very entertained so we bought this version because we enjoy our music a bit louder and fuller.
Love that you can pick different colors for the tablet, my mom will love it. Great easy functionality and ability to delete apps and install new ones.
With this device, you no longer need anything but wifi.
Gecksqd. Helpful in understanding different things .
Amazon knocks it out of the park with this Fire TV. Very easy to use and runs apps faster than Roku. Well worth the money
Nothing special just okay
We use the Amazon echo for everything from News updates to the weather report to playing our favorite music to controling lights in our home no complaints love it
This device is awesome if you already have a prime subscription. It allows you to have SIRI like functions and even order direct from amazon. Speaker doesn't sound bad either. I would recommend this item if you also have smart plugs to turn on and off small appliances or lights.
Easy to use. I'm still playing around with it. Purchase it for my son.
I would recommend this product to all my friends and family!
I absolutely love the kindle fire my boyfriend got it for my two youngest children who are five n six n must say I love the restriction time and parental control out of everything!
Great product for kids . Handy for travel purpose.
Easy to use and a lot of features. Perfect size screen.
My grandson had an older Kendall and I bought him a new were one and he loves it and it's a wonderful device
gave this as a gift and she seems to like it and using it often
It is better than in thought it was. At first I didnt like how small the screen was, but then the conistent reading, it got much better. After a month i it grew on me.
This is a great device for your transition off cable. I recommend slingtv to help the transition. I have the firetv as well as the firestick. Spend the additional money for better wifi. You can also wire direct for best HD streaming. Netflix and Prime work well over wifi with 20 Mbps type speed. I just upgraded to 100 Mbps for better results. Also see Kodi app.
Just what you'd expect. Construction is solid. The interface is intuitive. Screen is very readable and the unit fits well in the hand and is comfortable to hold for a long time when you get hooked on a great read.
Great product and very useful for weather and traffic reports.
Great and inexpensive tablet which meets all my needs and expectations.
Works great in my entertainment setup. My only real complaint is that you can't control it directly using an Echo - currently using a Harmony Hub.
It was a cheap tablet just for kids to watch movies. However, it forces you to put your credit card numbers to register the product. I don't want to since kids will be playing with it. I don't want them to be able to purchase apps without approval. Reset it to factory default, but the setup changed not the same as first started. Anyway, I won't but it again.
I bought this as a gift and it has performed perfectly. Can't beat at this price.
Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
Hopefully works great this is for my 3t son. Can't beat the price.
This tablet has everything you need to get you by. The quality is great and for the prize I can't complain.
Great device very functional love it will recommend
I purchased this and the Dot for use with my elderly parents. Both have poor eyesight and this voice driven product has enriched their lives. Set up an Amazon Alexa product for them and enrich their lives. Alarm clocks, timers, weather, news, music are just some of the things that can help them.
Very fun for the whole family! We have recommended this to our friends.
This product is as described. It's portable and the speaker is loud.
Works well and I would highly recommend this product.
The sales rep told me this kindle Fire tablet is easy to set up. Just follow the directions. Three hours later + a trip back to the store, a member of the Geek Squad finally got my e mail to work. He could not tell me why it was a problem. Also the camera quality is very poor. If you use it to check your e mails and browse the web, its fine. Other than that.... oh well.
Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
Only used a few times since I bought it, but the few questions I asked answered them fast and correctly
Very pleased with the Fire TV. I thoroughly researched alternative products before deciding on the Fire TV. The unit is fast and I enjoy the integration with Amazon Video, Netflix and other streaming services. My only issue is that the box is very simplistic cosmetically as compared with Apple TV or G Box. Other than that this is a great product.
Brought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it! Great product for the price.
This was a great purchase. I use it to order merchandise, play music, and answer questions.
Debated whether to purchase this or not. Recently cut the cable cord. We also subscribed to sling tv and already was Netflix subscriber. Love this option. My favorite is the music stations. Most have lyrics to the songs I enjoy through amazons fire tv.
I bought this tablet for my wife to play games on and read her books- she loves it! It was easy to set up and get going quickly!
I have 2 firestick and now the fire tv..i have it hooked to to my UHD tv and it's great.
I bought this intending to use it as a music and video player, so I can save battery for my phone. We got two, one for me one for my child. Mine works perfectly for what I bought it. All my music is on it with no problem. I did have to download an app to play my WMA files, but that was simple enough. My child's tablet is primarily used for app games, and I am told it is working just fine.
Nice inexpensive tablet for my kid. I put some movies on it and she was very happy on a 4 hour trip.
Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,
I so happy I can recommend this good thanks Best Buy is the number one
The Fire is very much so as it's slogan suggests, a sensible tablet. Inexpensive and versatile, highly recommend
Very cool and lots of features, I can play just about any song as a prime member, just say "Alexa, play...." or set timer for and set alarm for...I heard there are these modules and light bulbs the Echo can control. In the near future a device like this will be the center of your home controlling security, TV, heat/air, lights....so cool. Until then I love my Echo
I purchased this for Christmas.it was easy to set up and am now looking to purchase more for the other rooms.
We use Alexa with our Hue system to control our lights. We never manually turn on our lights anymore-- "Alexa-- Family room on!" It's fantastics.It's great to ask questions and play music. Our family loves it.
It's a great tab for low end applications. Especially for kids.
Bought this for my 9 year old and he absolutely loves it! The free pre installed apps, the High color resolution. The overall quality is great. Unfortunately no Google products are on this tablet and chromecast is not an option (amazon firestick ready). This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5
Works great, I can stream Netflix and a ton of other apps.
Small yet powerful; HDMI connection, 4K capable. Amazon content plus Android framework. Nearly perfect!
bought kindle for my wife she uses it for everything especially reading. loves it.
Best value tablet for the little ones. Great warranty, great parental controls. It's a shame Apple hasn't caught on to the needs of parents when it comes to digital media.
I love Alexa it's fun to use and so convenience. I use it as a timer when I'm cooking. Ask it to play music. Even my kids like it. Great product!
Hard wired as opposed to wireless. Easy to install. Much better than fire stick
Like it great apps selection.....,................
Alexa is helpful with the weather, sports updates, and music dancing during a party. Thank you Alexa. You even gave us some historical facts and dinner recipe ideas.
I was looking for a reader that was light enough to hold With one hand and this one is perfect.
I got it because I wanted to be able to use it to download books for college classes. It is slow and seems to freeze up a bit when I try to use it. I have a 64g memory card in it and have most of my stuff saved to it. I wouldn't think that would cause it to run slow.
Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.
I got this to replace the iPad for a child. I am so disappointed by the charge. It dies so quickly and the charger has to be wrapped around the tablet in order for it to charge. This was after 2 weeks of having the tablet. Low price but not worth the hassle and disappointment!
Seems ok but not what i really needed. I'm not much of a reader
I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.
Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though.
I love this Fire for kids. It even comes with the bumper cover. Great buy.
This is a great tablet for my 9yr old, and a great price to go with it.
Fast shipping and very happy with the amazon fire tv.
Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
It has some cool uses when it comes to books, music and home controls. However it needs better capability for voice control and command.
Great gift for my daughter. She's a big time reader, it saves a lot of space and money.
Enjoying Alexa a lot. Easy to use and great provider of information and music
Great fun...still experimenting with requests...music, etc.
It's a great tablet for the price. .I love the idea of shopping from my tablet.
Very good product. Works well with all televisions.
A perfect gift for entry level person. Very light weight and handy to use
When I bought this, I thought it was going to be yet another one of those purchases that I was going to think was a waste of money and more of a do nothing gadget that I tend to buy when I get bored, BUT boy was I surprised. We LOVE this. I find myself wishing Alexa was with me everywhere I go. Buy this... You won't no how you lived without her...
I have a regular echo and now the tap. Both awesome products, use them to control lights, locks, and play music. Would buy again.
Awesome product and top notch hardware inside the box and remote.
Great tablet for the price point....especially if you are big Amazon user.Expandable memory is a great feature.
The Paperwhite is my second Kindle. The back lighting and the ease of operation are big enjoyments and differences from my last (old) Kindle. The smaller size took a little getting used to, but, now it seems very comfortable. Very easy to personalize as well.
Replaced an older kindle with this new one. Great product. My wife really enjoys using it.
I think this product works good. I would recommend it.
much faster and stable than the fire tv stick... definitely worth the upgrade
This tablet is much faster than my 2012 Nexus 7, a perfect replacement at a great price.
This is the second fire tablet I've purchased. I got this one for my son for his birthday and I have one for myself. For the price, there simply isn't a better option!
I love my new fire tablet. It ls light and very easy to carry. I take it with me often. I have movies and music on it and it is great.
We use three in our house and I've bought a half dozen as gifts. I'm planning a roadtrip across the country and Alexa has given me complete weather for each stop
Bought this tablet as a gift for my grandfather for Christmas and he loves it! Very user friendly! It's also lightweight and easy to travel with.
I was looking for a good tablet, to use for movies, music. And to browse internet And when i saw that this tablet was on sale I had to buy it! and I'm glad I did. This is a great tablet and it"s light i carry in my purse. I Love it!
I love my 7" Fire Kindle...it's great when I go to appointments I can play some games or just read while I wait...light weight too not lugging around a bigger Reader...
Great e reader especially love the backlight. Definitely recommend to others
BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.
I got this tablet for my kids to play ANKI Overdrive, works flawlessly as host in multiplayer mode with IOS and Android devices!
I am very please with my Kindle Voyage. The size is perfect and the control lighting is exactly what I was looking for. Would recommend this to anyone.
This is easy to set up, we love the music and looking up info
Bought this for my uncle who is visually handicapped. He loves it! Weather at several locations, time, singer/ group verifications, connects to his iPhone Sirius XM station & so much more. Bought one for me!!!
I absolutely love Alexa, she can now play from my iTunes library when connected to my phone via Bluetooth. She is remarkable and I would choose Alexa over google voice.
It does so many Things. It is nice matching up with Echo Dot and using as Intercom.
Bought this tablet for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it!!
This is a very good product with good performance and value.
I love my fire tablet so much I have 6 of them. Well worth the $50!
the product is really crafted for kids n they just glue to it as it offers an array of rich topics, apps, etc
The best tablet I have had! Overall its great.Great camera, tools, apps & great battery! That will last.
I returned and got the 8" since this turned this product and would not turn on. I got another since it was a gift.
This nice, color e-reader doubles as an excellent low-cost tablet.
The echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you'll want them for all over your house.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and the uses are endless
I wish I had purchased this a earlier. Fun for the whole family.
We bought a second tv so we needed another firetv box. It works great with the services we're using.
I bought this tablet for my 8 year old son and he loves it. You can't beat $50 for this tablet. Not the most powerful or the best screen but compared to anything in this price range it's great.
Great tablet, easy to use. I used to carry a laptop when traveling, now this does everything I need.
Very helpful for keeping fitness, health and weight goals
I bought this tablet for my daughter to watch movies on & play educational games. It takes some time getting used to Amazon's Apps, But so far so good! It gets 4 stars bc the Camara takes terrible pictures.
This tablet is excellent when you are an on-the-go person. You not only have the ability to access the internet, but you have the ability to read a good book as well. You will not have to lug a big book with you if you’re out and about. I have never had a tablet where books can be downloaded onto it (and it’s free). I am one satisfied customer!
What a fun piece of equipment. I constantly find things for her to tell me.
It's great. I read it every day. The text is clear and easy to read. The battery life is nice.
Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
I bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. She is thrilled with it. She loves the number of books she is able to access. It wasd a Christmas hit!
Had one of these 2 years ago, got this one on sale and I usually pay more for a dinner. Does everything you need and plus you can expand the memory.
This paperwhite works well. It is easy to use. I would recommend. It is lighter than the fire I was using to read books on.
Is a god but i have to pay 100 dollar a year is to bad
The first one had a lag with the remote as it would randomly stop working but once I replaced it, it worked just fine.
Luv watching movies on the Amazon prime box.great price
Great gift for my Mother, she loves it. She plays Music to her grand baby's
I highly recommend this tablet for a toddler. There are plenty of learning activities that engage little minds. The case that comes with it is sturdy, my toddler drops/throws this tablet and it's not damaged at all.
Got this tablet to replace the one that had the screen cracked, cheaper than getting the screen replaced
I love having all of my streaming videos in one place and log on his single remote!
I've used a Nook for years but I'm beginning to like this tablet better. Charges very quickly.
I'm not big reader. Since the purchase, I have been reading a lot more! Even recipies!! I love this kindle! My boyfriend bought one the exact same time, then bought some cute cases for them.
Bought for Christmas for 6 and 8 year old granddaughters. Both girls loved it and have said it was their favorite gift.
Love it ! very easy to use!!! Good picture for movies!
I needed a tablet to play games, watch movies and so on while traveling. I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This tablet meets my expectations.
I love this tablet and it's easy to use. I would buy another for sure!
Gave it as a gift to a middle schooler. He loved it. Light, good monitor and decent speed.
The family really enjoys the Amazon Tap. This is an awesome investment. We talk to Alexa everyday.
All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!
Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
If you just want to place it and listen to music, this is a great unit. If you have a stereo get the dot.
Amazing for reading kindle which was my main concern. The cameras are not that amazing & downloding is pretty quick the battery evens last long great quality for its price great gift idea
This tablet is very kid friendly. It's easy for my daughter to operate.
Great stereo quality. You can ask Alexa to lower the sound volume or skip a song. Bought one for my son for Xmas and he loves it. Waiting to buy the charger.
good table good resoultion its better than the old table version my kids love it
This is honestly a little expensive. And I can find other ways to charge my devices.
great item for easy parental control... good size nice sounding speakers easy to use. but in a case asap!!! i bought more than one thank goodness... this item n the floor are not friends lol
I much prefer this over "multi-purpose" tablets. The screen is incredibly easy on the eyes. I can read it in bright light as well as in a dark room. It's easy to hold with one hand, plus the UI is very easy to navigate. I love the ability to highlight, make notes, and look up definitions.Did I mention that the charge lasts weeks? After reading one book (about 220 pages in print), I still had plenty of charge left.
I wld buy this product again great pics and price is well worth it
My nephews use their tablet all the time. It's durable and pretty fast. They love it.
Myself and my two kids have these tablets. The do exactly what I need them for, to read and watch streaming shows. They have games for my kids and they are cheap so if they break them I'm not to worried.
This is a awsome tablet and a great value love it!
Bought two of these as gifts they are well worth it. They withstand falls as well which is a plus.
This is the best of both worlds. A reasonably priced BT speaker and an Amazon Alexa enabled device. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a BT speaker and considering an Alexa enabled device.
It has everything I need, and is a great product at a low price!
With the newer 300ppi screen the Paperwhite really hits the sweet spot in the Kindle lineup.
Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone
Received this as a gift. I don't use it much but family loves it.
I have the have the Echo and this portable speaker is a great addition to my automated home. Especially if I'm working in the garage and want to listen to music
Smaller than I thought and processing speed is not very good. With that said, for the price you can't beat it...
We enjoy our Amazon Echo Alexa. I like being able to just ask a question out loud and receive the answer. If you want to know what the weather is like outside you just ask and she tells you:)
The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you.
This box is very easy to program and to use. We can access all types of TV programs and movies. The voice command is very cool and save a great deal of time not havei g to type every thing you're searching for. Love It!!
Got as a gift for my mom for Mother's Day . Really great
Recognizes all commands as long as you speak clearly and there are no other noises. Works like Siri your personal assistant.
Works like it should. Got it to watch Amazon and Netflix.
The Echo I found a little hard to get used to, but with more information I found the echo very useful to have.
Use it a lot for listening to audio books. Too many ads.
picked this item up on Halloween nite. Great content and shows-will recommend to friends and family
Before I switched to the Kindle white I was using Barnes and Noble Nook which had several down sides compared to the Kindle. Kindle battery last a long time compared to the Nook. Kindle does not jump pages like the Nook. Nook is very sensitive to touch and causes a lot of confusion when trying to find where you left off reading. My husband and I are very happy that we switched to Kindle especially since you have a greater selection of reading material through Amazon.
Got this for my mom so she can listen 2 music. Was simple to use.
I bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous 3 kindles I purchased. I am disappointed. I like the price. The home screen is just all the apps right in your face, not just the ones you want, like in the older version kindle fire. I mostly use it for reading books, and so far I'm dissatisfied. It's great to swipe to the next page, but when I want to go to settings or something else while reading I find it difficult to open. Instead the page just turns and by the time I finally get to the book settings, I've lost my spot! I downloaded the Facebook app and it's very slow. Maybe it's Amazons way of telling me that's what I get for $50 but come on. Sometimes I like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. I compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. I know there are other cool user tools, but for me I mostly use it to read and check Facebook and maybe Pinterest. It's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. I would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy.
Would highly recommend this product. Offers variety of TV watching.
The only thing I don't like is I can put my books in order
I purchased several of these for gifts. Everyone loved them. Works great and easy to use.
Great sounding speaker and microphones seems to work well. Good options for playing music as well as easy to set up. Wish there were better connection with iPhone so it is easier to request and play songs from iTunes as well as to make calls from phone.
Love my fire!! Easy to download books and is a great tablet for being so small. Price is right too.
I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members.
The echo is a great addition to our household. We love it so much we give them as gifts to our friends who don't already have it!!
I have bought a kindle paperwhite as a gift for three people and each has LOVED it. It's a reliable reader with a LONG battery life and a great little traveler. I highly recommend it.
Very easy to setup and use. Like the picture or screen. Bought 5 gave them as gifts. Everyone loved them.
This product works great. It was very easy to. Setup and get an account going I would recommend the fire tv to everyone that wants to cut the cord from cable. It was cheaper to purchase it at Best Buy then it was on Amazon
It's more for people that want to read without glare
I had been looking at the echo for awhile but wasn't an early adopter. As much as I geek out over products like this I wanted to wait till the skills library was a bit more tested and expanded. Well imagine my surprise when I got this as a gift! Absolutely love using my Echo/Alexa. Weather, music, shopping lists, and the constant things they are adding. Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat. Next purchase...smart plugs so I can turn some items off and on with my voice. Love the interactivity and I haven't even scratched the surface yet on all Alexa has to offer. I have found the Love my Echo website to discover new things I haven't tried yet.
Great product, and very easy to install and use. I love the music from Amazon Prime!
Let's me watch movies on road trips & overall good quality picture
I bought my son a Kindle a couple of years ago and decided to update his kindle to the newer vesion. He uses it for everything, which is great. Love that he can do so much with the kindle.
fast, easy to use, would recommend to anyone, !!!!
I bought it for my kid and he has loved it. Would recommend.
Bought 4 of these on Thanksgiving Eve. With their price that night, they were an amazing gift for my daughter's Christmas gift exchange, a donation to a less fortunate family, and kept one for me. I can only speak for the one I kept, but it's a great little, easy to hold device for reading.
Purchased these for my grandsons, ages 5 and 7, they absolutely love them. Able to download apps with ease.
Purchased these for our parents as a gift. Easy to use and entertaining. Amazon prime is a must.
I purchased this to use Playstation Vue and it seems to be working well. I also use if for Youtube and Netflix. Quite a few reviews commented on the remote losing connection with the main unit but I have not had that problem.
Really like the touch screen factor. Really lights up easy to read especially since you can enlarge the font
Great item. My teen lives it. This item offers more than just reading.
novelty products ala Siri, provides information on the spot. make sure that a wireless high speed internet connection is available or it will generate a great degree of frustration
It's a good buy compared to google home Over all I'm happy I bought this
Perfect for night time reading and outdoor reading!
Amazon fire is almost relevant to a tablet, which holds ,post of the feature and respect to processor speed it more than the expectation to surf and listen music
I purchased for my 7 yr old grandson to use for playing games. He is very happy with it. It appears to be a good buy .
I love the fact that this Kindle has an expansion slot so I can add memory for movie and music (and book!) downloads! Awesome!
Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music.
We decided to buy the tablet so our toddler could play educational games on hers instead of going for my iPad. I love how we can block her from going on the Internet as well as set a curfew. It's easy to use and my daughter loves it!
It's great since you can plug into an rj45 connector it's much faster than the fire stick
I got this to test it out to see if it would be good for my nieces' and nephews' Christmas gifts. Got to say, impressed. I went ahead and purchaed several more. I mean, it is not a Nexus 7 or Galaxy Tab, but for the price point, you really can't beat it. The expandability is also impressive, too
It does work well, the only issue is it just needs more support. I understand that more is coming all the time. I do enjoy it
Great tablets I bought two of these for a 5 yr and 6 yr the parental control is an awesome feature. No regrets whatsoever.
The Kindle Paperwhite was well worth the upgrade from my previous Kindle E-Reader. The touch screen capability makes it so much handier than turning pages and navigating with buttons, and the lighted display lets me sit and read wherever I like. These features use up battery a bit faster than the basic model, but recharging more frequently is not so bad considering the conveniences gained. I noticed one bothersome quirk, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Sometimes it jumps ahead more than one page when I touch to turn. Checking online, I see that I'm not the only one experiencing this problem. If it continues or becomes more bothersome, I will contact Amazon customer service for a solution.
I received the echo dot for Christmas and I love it! So when my nephew put the echo on his list of gifts for graduation I knew I had to get it for him. He loves it so much it makes me want to get one.
Ok I purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday. So far she loves it but gets tired of the kids included amazon trial videos. So I end up logging into my user account for her to be able to go on YouTube. But she really likes and enjoys her new tablet. Over all it's a good tablet for kids. What had me on purchasing this tablet was the free no question asked replacement warranty. She has dropped it many times but the included foam case has protected the tablet every time.
I love this little tablet. My daughter loves free time app on it. She wants to play on the fire tablet more than her kids Samsung tab
I bought my daughter one an she literary have been on it every sense I purchased I would definitely approve this on the market for the little ones cheap and worth every penny
Product does exactly what you would think. Works well for any and all type reading.
This is a great on-the-go speaker. I like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in. Also, bonus: Alex. I like the update they have done to it as well where you don't have to push the button to activate her, you can just say her name. If you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much, choose this one. Spend more,m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound, but you can't travel with it.
But even better with Kodi! Love the 4K! The remote could be better
I'm enjoying using this, though it occasionally can't understand me, especially during the word game. I love asking for music, any kind, and have it play. I love that I can use it to set alarms, to ser time limits, to ask the weather and to have Alexa tell me corny jokes. Recently I purchased the wifi plugs, but I haven't set them up yet.
i purchased the fire for my self to play games and surf the web. then my husband took my fire so i purchased one for him.
Good tablet for a good price. Great for our 8 year old
Love this product. The coolest thing I've ever seen. When Elexa listens to my demands and plays what I want to listen to is pretty cool Everyone needs one.
I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal.
Great tablet for Web surfing, reading and social media. Also has a good camera
This was my second one I have bought. These are not water proof
Easy to use and great clear image. Only use it as a digital book/magazine. Don't use camera.
easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS
Good sound but unlike Echo, you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do. I ordered a Dot so this may solve that issue.
My wife loves her new Kindle. She is using it all the time. She replaced her 1st gen kindle e-reader with this
The apps offered was as expected. I was surprised that it was heavier than I w pe red.
I like it and it does almost everything that I ask.
8/18/16Love the product & price.Would recommend.Customer.
I'm very happy with my Alexa Echo, it has a great features...makes my life easier...Love it!!!!
I got these for my teenage daughters and they loved them.
Love the firestick. You don't need cable tv anymore.
Very good tablet camera not very good poor resolution
I'm not very tech savvy but we're getting there! I think this is a great price for a tablet that can do so much!
handy
Screen, camera, and processor don't perform too well but for the price you pay, it's definitely a bargain.
Not as quick as my iPad but a great solution for traveling. Some of the apps that you get on an iPad are unavailable. Happy purchaser!
I had a Kindle earlier and rarely used it because the interface did not feel reading-friendly. This one is better. I am using it for two textbooks and find the interface improved. The purchase came with a free month of amazon prime which was a plus -- even though I decided not to renew after the month was over.
I waited too long to get the Amazon Echo. It's a perfect complement to my Sonos system and we got one for the kitchen n and another for the master bath. Connects to siriusXM and Pandora, reads me the news in the morning and frankly it's fun to have around!
This tablet is a great value. Tablets in this price range usually end up failing quickly, but this tablet has held up perfectly for almost a year now. The 8GB is somewhat small, but adding an SD card has helped with storage. The lack of Google Play is a nuisance as the app selection is more limited, but by adding Aptoide, I was able to access many of the apps that are available in the Play store, but not Amazon.
The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again
Got this as a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law. He loved it!
Product seems to connect to Wi-Fi pretty easily. So far has been pretty durable and held up to a couple of drops. Good picture and it streams games pretty easily
I bought this with every intention on reading more. Unfortunately I haven't the time. Still. Happy with functionality and options. Would purchase for a family member
The fire tablet is awesome. I thoroughly enjoy the tablet. Everyone should have this item.
I bought this for my 4 year old she loves it never outs if down
Alexa is awesome. If you are looking into a smart home this is the only way to go.
We bought this tablet for a 8 year old boy. Works really well. We have had no problems with anything. It is used primarily for games.
Love that I don't have to clutter my living room with DVDs
This device performs great! For the price it's really a steal. Affordable and easy to use.
Alexa is always available to answer questions or play my favorite music.
Great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads
All in all it is pretty cool but seems pretty limited to me. Gets annoying when you constantly have to access SPotify before asking for an artist or it defaults to Amazon free previews...but I get it. Wish it could answer more questions but assume that will come with time, updates or future models. Feels like one of those technological offerings that you try and fit into your life versus one that naturally fills a void.
Had my original Kindle for 8 years with never a problem. When it finally died in December, I felt I could just use my iPad and Kindle app. But I missed the smaller and easier to hold Kindle more than I expected. Love the new paper white. No external light source required to read in bed, but easy on the eyes. Only regret I can't get my word games on it due to incompatibility, otherwise would be 5 stars.
A very nice gift for all. My mother loves it. Super
This is only a good product if have amazon prime account
Fire tabs always work great! I will always recommend it
I use this table to control all of the smart devices in my home. Its the perfect size to do so. Also has the convenience of everyone in the home having the ability to do so with out have to us "my" phone.
I bought this tablet and used it for two days and felt like returning it. It didn't have play store, amazon' s version of Android literally kills the processor and makes it too slow. Web browsing through silk browser was a pain. It took for ever to load even simple pages like google. Apps were all useless, and the only thing you could do is listen to preloaded music( not streaming music) and read ebooks. Anyway, I changed my mind in the last minute and decided to root it. Installed slimLp and got rid of Amazon's junk, and it made a huge difference. The performance is way better and it actually works like a decent tablet now. It's a great tablet for the price only if its rooted. If you have no idea of rooting or don't like to risk it, its not worth a penny! Its a good buy if you plan on rooting it.
I saw the reviews and was impressed so I purchased 3 Kindle Fire tablets for my grandsons who are 9 years old. Needless to say, they were thrilled with them!
The Amazon - Echo is not just an amazing sound device but offers an always improved upon array of innovative services. My Best Buy for the year so far.
Easy to get started. Great variety of apps. Price very attractive..
We are using Alexa for many daily chores, music, weather, radio etc.
Echo learns as you use it. As you learn how to ask questions echo's answers get better.
I have owned the echo for about a month now and it has worked great. Connects directly to the internet and also streams music from major streaming services and allows connections from Bluetooth. You can also download skills which gives it added functionality. It can do so many things that it is taking me time to explore the limits of its capabilities great product..
Canceled my cable and got one of these. Steams netflix, hulu, amazon prime and anything else you need great.
This product is excellent for what we need.....only internet!
Great tablet especially for the price.Brother loved it for Christmas.
Nice product I like the color of the screen very clear
Easy to set up. Works great. Helpful tutorial. Would recommend over a Roku.
Not only is it an excellent first tablet for a child, but it is a kindle. They can grow into it as well. And from studying up on the product before hand, I was able to determine that they have excellent customer service! That is a big plus!
I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves the processing speed and the fact that it has 2 cameras on the device.
I got this box's for a gift and they love it and for that price can't beat that
Paying $49 for a decent screen size to support portable surfing and email on wifi is a great deal. Not sure I'm a fan of Silk, but it works well enough.
The Echo is the start of a very long relationship. I'm able to order on Echo, listen to music, and have a joke told to me.
The Echo is amazing and very quick with every question you throw at her.
Love the sound quality, perfect for what l needed it for.
I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading.
Very easy to use. I have downloaded three books and I am enjoying reading them.
This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.
This is a great tablet for the price I paid. My husband loves it!
I purchased the FireTV to integrate into my Control4 system as a media streaming device. It has worked flawlessly in the mode. I'm still getting used to the controls but they seem pretty straight forward.
Ties in perfectly with my wink hub. I am able to control my lamps and overhead light with my voice. Love it
She never has an answer for anything, she has to always be connected to an outlet, too hard to connect to other devices
Great tablet for the kids they can use it for games.
This is some advanced ass technology.
I have my Echo setup in my kitchen as that is where I get the most use of it. There is a learning curve to figuring out its limitations and getting it setup though. After that it is a fun device to use like I can add things to my grocery list or play a podcast or play Prime Music or turn on lights or give me the weather and sports scores. I am slowing setting my home up to have connected devices and this was a great starting device. I would say if you have spotty internet service this thing will not work but when you are on DSL you get what you pay for right?
Brought it for my husband and he loves it. There's fun apps and other things you can connect to.
My mom loves it for reading. My mom is not tech savvy but she was able to adapt pretty quickly.
works as described, but still needs some improvements such as more languages, more convenient menu... overall, it is one of the best TV boxes in the market now.
The Echo is plenty loud for our needs and performs as expected.
Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they're an Amazon version and limited.
good tablet for the price. only drawback is the limited apps for the fire compared to android tablets
Found out after having had opened and tried programming this awesome alexa that basically nothing comes with it. It's a listening device in my home that won't do anything unless I pay more into Amazon. The fact that I synced my pandora account is pointless because I have to spell out what I want Alexa to play by saying, "Alexa play 'X' station from my pandora play list." How is the rest of my family suppose to know what to request when I am the only one who knows my pandora play list (and barely at that!) I have many complaints, and basically disappointed in my purchase. I was lead to believe this was the radio of the future. It is if I pay for the Amazon Music Unlimited monthly.
the Amazon Echo does many things now with the potential of so much more in the future. It's providing great information every day.
Echo is a fun and practical unit. Plays great music and controls my lights. Love it.
I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
I have really enjoyed by Amazon Fire. It does everything I need and is small enough for my purse.
Works great just make sure you have wifi and an Amazon account.
Got it for my 9 year old son for his Common robot, he loves it, it's very easy to use and for the price well worth it
Chose this tablet due to the parental control features as a gift for my granddaughter.
Very satisfied with it as wellbas the serv8ce received form sale person
The service and shopping experience was great. The products are amazing.
Great price. Great product. Best product for the money.
I purchased this tablet for my grandma and she was able to learn to use it right away. This is a great tablet for someone who is a beginner when it comes to technology.
The Fire is a good deal for the amount of money it cost. Simple to use and has a nice screen display.
I love this product it very great for my son. My son educational apps on here
My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc.
Previous owner of an older kindle. Love the touch pad and back light on the voyage.
I love this item because my three children can use it ages 11 to 15. The screen is fenomenal.
This product is no different than the fire stick in my opinion it does have more memory and an option where you can add an SD card to it but other than that it is the same as a firestick no reason to pay twice the money for this box
Great funtionality and the remote with voice control is great. Better expierence than chromecast. The remote and streaming quality is superior than the chromescast solution.
My niece is going to love this! Great price and nice color.
My 3yo loves it and never wants to put it down. Lots of preloaded educational games and videos!
This is just what is advertised on the box. It was very easy to set up and use.
This was just what we were looking for our kids picked it right up and was playing on it in just minutes
The tablet is good for the price is really being sold
This is my second tablet, my daughter love it, just the perfect gift.
Good for the price. Expandable memory. Laggy at times.
Amazing price and awesome for a tablet for children. My 6 & 13 year old nieces love them
I bought 2, hardest part was going from iOS to learning to use the kindle fire. My daughter and brother love it!
Great device really like the option to use either wifi or lan
basic tablet. Good for beginners. Easy to carry. It can be used with ease.
one of the best products I have purchased. great sound
I got this as a replacement for my daughters kindle. It works much better than the one that came in the box, no idea why but thankful it was sent to me!
Lots of Fun!! Great for getting fast facts, playing a song, or adding items to a shopping list that's on the app on your phone. Great gift idea!!
This isn't a high performance tablet but i didn't expect it to be for the price. It's perfect for playing app games, reading, and web browsing. The biggest downfall is the limitations on customizing the home screens.
Great for everything when your hands are full and if you like to multitask.
It's easy to carry and super device for all books.
I bought this for my 12 year old son. He loves it and read much more now. Works as expected....Great!
Great expirience reading from a deviceGood for your eyes
Great kindle for the price nice picture for a 7 inch screen
Great Tablet for occasional users who want to Watch Movies, Read books, and browse the web.
The things that you can do with the Amazon Echo are amazing.
Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization.
I love my new kindle. I bought one earlier this summer for myself and just recently for my ten year old. One function that is awesome is its ability to work with the audible application. I can read on my kindle then audible will pick up where I left off, so I can continue with the read during my commute. My kindle will then propose to move my place to where I left off in audible. It has made my commute very purposeful because I am able to read literature for work a lot more efficiently. This may have been one of the smartest purchases I have ever made for professional development!
Highly recommended to all. Battery is good. A lot of things to do just like any expensive tablet on a cheaper price.
great tablet to use around the house, and on the go . my wife like to read alot
I purchased Amazon Fire for my son after reading enough reviews about this product. It works ok for e-books but very slow for Internet streaming and downloading. Also, the touch function is not very sensitive which you need to hit the same button couples of time to make it work.
I love my new Amazon Fire tablet. Its so easy to use and stays charged for a nice amount of time.
Another great Amazon product. Simple tablet that does what I need it to.
My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel "so grown up"! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!
Bought this for my daughter. Tablet works amazing. Only thing I didnt like was that you are REQUIRED to place a CC on file with amazon in order to use it.I would say if you are looking for a tablet stick to the samsung galaxy models vs others.
First experience with a tablet for my husband who likes it and uses it all the time. We like it.
Everything you need in a tablet !! Fast shipping, thank you.
I got this for $35 during Black Friday. Since I've had it, I noticed that the battery life does not last very long. I have to charge it at least once a day. At first, I thought that I may have a faulty tablet, but I looked on Amazon's website and the Fire has a battery life of 7 hours...no wonder.The size of the Fire, though is small enough that I can take it with me when I go out and am waiting to pass the time. I also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while I'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.I use the Fire for different things. Mainly, to play apps and stream videos on Amazon prime. For these functions, there's a little in the animation, when I play games, but it isn't frequent.I have read several books on the Fire and I must say, that I prefer to read off of the Nook HD. The print on the Fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the Nook.Since the Fire is from Amazon, it is locked down to only work with "Amazon approved" apps. As I mentioned earlier, I have a Nook as well. On that, I am able to download the Kindle app and read books that I have purchased through Amazon on the Nook. On the Fire, however, I am not able to download the Nook app so that I can read books that I have purchased through for the Nook.Overall, for the price that I paid, this is not bad. This is one of those tablets that if it gets dropped, I wouldn't get a headache over it.
I already have a Kindle, and a tablet, but I wanted something smaller to take when traveling to download movies to. This is perfect! Good price, and the color and clarity is perfect!
Kids love it! We are Prime members, good kid friendly case... purchased a 128gb memory card to hold all kinds of games and movies
It has taken time for me to learn how to use it, but I have been able to: use on Europe vacation, download books & audio books from library, look quickly at multiple email accounts, & communicate with grown children through Facebook messenger.
This is a very fun and useful devise. Very easy to setup! It has great sound. I was able to setup with the apps to turn on/off my TV along with my lights. I love how there are so many new apps. I can't wait to connect it to my Sonos speakers.I love it so much I purchase several of the Amazon Dot for my family members for Christmas gifts.
I have been wanting an Amazon echo for quit sometime. It is everything and more then what I hoped for. It's an incredible speaker on top of being the best source for all information. The kids even enjoy Alexa playing games and singing songs. It keeps my life more organized and more entertaining. Best money I have ever spent on my love of gadgets.
The Tap is a fun way to be able to bring Alexa around your home. Where ever you are, you can get access to all of the information, music, news, radio and more!
I wasn't expecting to purchase the Amazon Fire but, I wanted something smaller to tote around with me when I needed to instead of a big lap top. The screen is crisp and clear, and this tablet is faster than I expected when surfing around web pages. Glad I got this!
Not bad,but returned it and bought a dot to go with my soundtouch 20. Would recommend this if your not fussy about your music.
I bought this for my son. Some of his homework needs to be done online and the tablet worked perfectly for it. He could also use it at the zoo to take pictures and use it to play games.
Boys gift to their mother for mother's day. She was thrilled to get it and still enjoys it. Great!
just what is needed!
Great speaker, great sound quality, gets super loud. Alexa is helpful and can really do a lot. Highly recommend toanyone
This is an improvement over the old Kindle. Have had it for a couple months and it works great.
I thought I'd love this but felt like it had very little purpose. Did like it at all.
The tablet was easy to set up and the kids enjoy using it.
It really is amazing that it not only answers your questions but also can find and play your favorite music!
Got it for my daughter. Great tablet. It replaces a fire HD 6.
Great pay back for each $ spent. Basic tablet, very good for reading and surfing.
Works great with the dot across opposite ends of the house.
Love love it .works for me it's my best friend in my head.
This is my fourth one. I have one at work, one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom. This one was for my wife's work - she loves it. Good sound and amazing features.
This tablet is great for the price. Gets everything done quick and easy
If you never thought about getting a Echo you should now because this is the best thing since sliced bread.
Friendly user systen, easy to setup, good size to put in a bag
Bought for my kid, it's great for him, the apps are good, the free time, bumper and warranty make it worry free!
if you have a fire stick and use it everyday, I recommend upgrading. Actually being connected to my modem is so much faster than using the wifi signal. Less buffering with faster loads. No complaints.
$50 for a tablet is amazing. It does what it needs to do with not alot if frills.
I love my my fire TV, it has everything you need to stream shows/movies to your TV.
Alexa recognizes most commands and questions and will tell you when she doesn't. Seems like she learns daily. We have the remote control too and it's very helpfull when Alexa is not in the room that we are in. Set up is easy and music sounds great. Shopping lists and to do lists are awesome and they appear on your smart phone via the Alexa app. Timers and alarms are useful too. Right now my complaint is Alexa cannot answer your paired smart phone yet, I read Amazon is working on this.
The echo is still in the beginning stages of AI but is still great to have in your home. I loved how I could speak in another room in a normal voice and echo will work on command.
This is a great device and so much fun to use. It is so versatile in what it can and control.
It is not an iPad but for $40 it is a good tablet. Really good for reading.
Easy to readNo eye strainLong battery lifeSimple to useInterfaces well with computerNot for web browsingVery ergonomicLightweightSturdy
when switched to the kid mode it takes the worry away of them getting on inappropriate sites. The 1 year warranty is cheaper than buying a case for it fyi
Must have Amazon paid service to play music from the cloud and must be set up from the mobile app. Not portable. Cannot connect to Fire tv. Took some getting use to for me to get the commands right to change my nest thermostat. Must use the app to install 3rd party skills to the app to control smart devices.
I bought for my mother it's easy-to-use. Convenient for her to search the web and play her games.
This is a great tablet. I bought it for my daughter and it's very easy for her to use.
I wanted an inexpensive tablet that would allow me to surf the web and this was perfect! On top of it there are many other features that could be useful but you can't go wrong if you're just looking for the basics so purchase and enjoy.
Nice buy, great resolution I dimmed lightingWeight is good too
It is a good tablet for the kids to play their games on. Only drawback is the way the cord plugs into the kindle. We have had to fix 2 kindles because of this issue. For the price though, it's worth it.
I absolutely love my Echo! There's not a day that goes by it isn't being used. Would highly recommend to anyone with a hectic schedule like myself.
I purchased this tablet for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It has parental controls also (which she doesn't love)!
Many of my friends raved about how well the Fite Tv performed and after months of hearing great things about it, I have to say this has been one of the best investments.
Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
Great device to entertain the children while traveling
Kindle e reader is a wonderful device. I like the inbuilt light. It does not hurt eyes and it does not have side effects (headache or hang over in the morning) if used in the night unlike tabs.
I am Giving this tablet away to someone birthday sup.
I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!
Nice to have. Convenient for vacations etc. would like it more if the local library had more choices.
This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.
I bought this after my Kindle Keyboard died. I like having a dedicated reader. Its easier on my eyes. Its light weight and fits in my purse with the cover on it. The ads don't bother me. Great purchase
Love the Paperwhite, easy to read in any light, easy to carry.
When the unit is working, it's everything that you would want. However, the unit needs to be reset often as it will not turn on with the remote. Once you unplug it and plug it back in, it works fine.
Alexa has transformed out life at home. She chooses the music we listen to ("Alexa, play music"), she keeps track of our shopping ("Alexa, reorder cat food"), she makes sure we don't burn dinner ("Alexa, set a 15 minute timer")...I find myself asking for things when I'm not at home, only to be disappointed she isn't there. We are looking forward to buying other "smart home" items so that she can help use even more!
Everything you need with this little box. Get yours today!
So easy to use and navigate. Easy easy Amazon downloads from books to apps etc. I'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and Best Buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .
Best Buy always offers great products at great prices. There sales are outstanding and I always find their sales persons to be knowledgeable and friendly.
First got it for my wife who loves tech toys. We played with it and laughed and laughed. But after awhile it's used less and less as it can't find answers to things.
Great product... Met all my expectations
Great birthday gift for a 9 year old. He has enjoyed this so much.
I had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one I wanted. As I looked at and tried several, I thought the Kindal Fire was the one I wanted. After discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, I decided.that it was the reader I wanted. It has turned out to be just what I wanted.
Very excellent product, I am very excited about using it!
I have the old Kindle that is similar to this but was alot more. For the price this is a steal. I will buy a couple more for gifts. The only real complaint is the speaker is a little weak so invest in headphones or a plug in speaker.
i didn't knew about the product before i went to the best buy. Say the tablet with decent price and bought it so that i can give it as a gift. it works well.
We like our new Alexa but wish I had a tutorial to teach me how to maximize its use.
this is an excellent product provide a great picture
We have a couple of these now for our kids. Create a kid account and allow access to a few apps, add a memory card for more storage for movie video files that you have and it's enough to entertain the kids on car trips or keep them from going nuts in restaurants occasionally.
I wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick. I'll get flowers next time.
I have really enjoyed this purchase in the month that I have had it. It is very versatile, responds to many voice commands, makes additions to my calendar - and it has a great speaker. I recommend.
My girlfriend has been using an iPad for several years. She decided she wanted to try the Kindle because I liked mine so much, so I got one for her for Christmas. Now she is hooked. (Anyone want to buy an iPad?)
We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too.
Not only can you read books, you can do everything on it such as play games, order from Amazon login to Facebook and so much more!
Bought this kindle for my dad for Christmas. He loves it.
This is a good product for a good price. Please note my use of the word "good". The Amazon Fire tablet is not the best tablet on the market but it is a good deal for a low price. I bought this product as a gift for my mom and she likes it. It gets the job done. She uses it occasionally to read during her morning commute on the train or in a busy waiting room. This is not a product built for heavy use.
I have one myself and I bought 2 more as Christmas gifts while they were on sale. Sometimes Alexa has a hard time giving you the answer. I guess I have to work on how I have to ask to get the correct response. Otherwise, I enjoy Alexa Echo.
Very handy gadget, Performs well,a little difficult to get used to the commands and setting up music!
Pages are white and bright - indeed like a paper.Font and ability adjust its style and size gives perfect readability.Batteries last for very long time - long enough that you do not think much about charging them.
Bought it for my wife she loves it and I would but one for my self too
I purchased this wall charger because I have had issues with Samsung and other Kindle chargers. So far, this charger is great. Devices charge rapidly.
Keeps my granddaughter busy. She was showing me how to use it. Now she doesn't want to use mine.
designed to serve so many needs-- info, music and more!
This is one of the best products that someone has come with. I love it
My sons love playing on their tablet. Not only does it allow me additional time to get things done but they enjoy the educational apps provided.
A great price for new technology. I would definitely recommend this product for any family out there. This product is up with all current events, which keeps me informed of what's going on every day.
I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.
This tablet was a gift for a child and they absolutely love it.
I bought this tablet as a Christmas gift. It is a great tablet for a great price!
I highly recommend this product. My previous kindle didn't have one, so I'm very please with this charger. It's much more convenient than recharging through my computer.
Sound is good. Very convenient for getting weather, setting alarms, news updates. Alexa sounds so much like a real person. Love that!
The Echo is growing on me. It can give you weather or traffic or sport scores. All without lifting a finger. It can tell me how many steps on my Fitbit. It's learning new things all the time. It great. I recommend it. The possibilities are endless.
I purchased this as a gift and I'm had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations.
I have an Amazon fire tablet and love it so hopefully he will also. Pretty easy to use as your first tablet.
Great price. Easy surfing the web, great game playing, and way to enjoy reading new books. 8 GB is large enough. I like I can purchase gifts cards to make purchases.
Have 2 Echo's and 1 Dot located in out two homes. Love all of them...very versatile and provide needed information and entertainment when and as needed. Very useful and cost effective.
It's a great item to have in the house or wherever you maybe.
No problems. Easy to setup and use. Streaming videos is pretty darn good with very little lag over my wireless router. I use a Netgear Nighthawk x6. Recomend getting the firestick tv. Great bang for the buck.
Very easy to setup and use. Fun addition to family entertainment with the jeopardy game!
I got this for a friend an was very pleased. The fire tablet is awesome. It dose everything the kindle fire dose.
Really easy to work with lots of extras. Good buy for kids and adults
This has a lot of good features to limit the amount of time and what is accessed.
I gave as a gift to a kid who has autism! It has been helping on his development a lot!
this is my first tablet and so far it has been great. Games and apps. all loaded fast and worked great. Wish battery was stronger but I use it around the house a lot and plugging it in is not a problem and it charges fast.
This is an upgrade we purchased for Mom. She was able to use it with no problem. Alot like her previous Kindle
Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up.
I used to stream just about everything I watch. Beats paying a large cable bill.
I can't say enough good about this product. It has LED's so the screen is backlit, and yet the battery still lasts for weeks! I've had mine for over a month and I still haven't had to charge it. The capacitive touch screen is perfectly responsive and fast too. It makes no sense at all to pay so much more for the voyage or oasis, when the paperwhite is such a fantastic buy.
This tablet is showing it's age. I bought one for my 10 year old back when he was 7 and it was cool then. Picked up two on sale for my 4 and 5 year old so they can leave my phone alone and they like it. However it's slow when downloading apps and I constantly have to plug in my pin. Battery life isn't that great either especially when they stream movies so i still have to give up my phone . Overall still a decent product hood picture and they like it.
Great for little kids but I have a 10 year old daughter with Autism that loves this. She can watch movies, play games, and READ her favorite books.
What a Buy at sale price..Keyboard functions smoothly. Commands transfer without jitters.
I bought it for my Dad to play games and to download books on it so he won't drain his phone battery.
Great for reading in low and bright light. Easy to download books
I bought this Kindle as a gift for my 9 year old grand daughter. I have one of my own and absolutely love it. I read books, surf the web and also read all my personal emails with it. Great product for a great price! And so easy to use.
Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available
Amazon added the OpenDyslexic font, which should be applauded. Recommend to buy.
My daughter loves this tablet, its easy to used and secure enough to not have stolen.
I love the parental controls available. You can set what time they can start and stop using, as well as how much time on each activity. Also love the guarantee of replacement.
I bought this for my eight year old child. I didn't want to spend a ton of money so for what I paid it was worth the money.
My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
I really like the simplicity of the Amazon Fire Stick. It is a great product from when I am on the go and I can plug it in where ever I have a WiFi connection. It is easy to use and simple. If you are looking for basic but functional, Fire TV is a good buy.
A great buy as a second wife to my husband! She has all the answer without the smart mouth, she listen and most of all she shut's her mouth!
Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.
We are very happy with our new Alexa product. We are so happy that we have been calling our daughter daily with new ideas on how to use it. This has prompted her purchase one as well.
It works great! Alexa responds quick , easy to set up! sound is ok.
Bought it for Father's Day and my dad and mom love it!
If you want a dedicated device for reading books, the Kindle paperwhite is great. Battery lasts for weeks without a charge, screen is easy on the eyes,links to dictionary.com and wikipedia are so helpful!
I love it and I brought two more for my Grandson and God Daughter.
Love Echo for streaming music and trivia and weather reports. Very entertaining
very user friendly along with very low monthly cost to gain access to Amazon catalogs
Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. .
Able to watch Amazon Prime now on our smart TV. Easy install and breeze to work!
Great product. I love it. Best thing I every got. I would recommend.mend this product to everyone.
I can't believe I've wasted my money on cable all these years. I'm really happy with my purchase.
Good beginner tablet, Light enough for small hands to carry. I got the cover as well which was a good investment as little hands tend to drop things. Not a lot of space, but enough.
Wonderful product to have for toddlers and preschoolers.
I previously had a first edition paper white and finally pulled the trigger on a voyage. I'm so glad I did, the resolution is great and it seems easier to read. I also like that the screen is completely flat. I don't really use the page turn buttons like I thought i would but it is nice to have the option.
I bought this product based on reviews, and it fits the description as a near-perfect, reasonably-priced, all-purpose Kindle reader. The screen's front-lit display allows me to read under all lighting conditions, from bright sunlight to dark, without eyestrain.I bought the Paperwhite as a supplemental reader for my Samsung tablet so that I could read outside. After several months of use, I'm finding that I do all my reading on the Paperwhite.I read several hours a day and the battery lasts four or five days under that usage, which is a great change from my tablet, which needed a recharge daily, usually at an inconvenient time.I recommend buying the companion leather case because the case puts the Paperwhite to sleep with the cover is closed, extending battery life.
Don't know what I did before I had this. She is a great assistant in the kitchen, and am considering getting a couple of Echo Dot's for other rooms in the house. Very handy if you have other smart items in your home.
We had a streaming movie box that had Kodi pre-loaded. Even though the box was capable of speeds up to 100 mbps, it seemed to always buffer or just stop. We bought the Amazon fire because it supports up to 200 mbps and supports 4k as well. I rarely have any issues now. Also the number of apps this will run is great.
I always purchase the fire sticks til someone told me to try the fire boxWish I would have done it first. Love it. Much betterSpeed faster
this is a great tablet at a great price. unfortunately it can't connect to google play without hacking. if that's what you need, look at the acer tablet. if you are looking for an inexpensive fire tablet, you can't go wrong with this.
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I want one now.
This is an awesome product. Great for watching shows and movies!
can't go wrong with it, my first ever tablet, it's worth the price
Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
Bought this for my girlfriend's son and he absolutely loves it. Just about every person I talk to who owns one falls in love with it. Highly recommended.
I bought 4 of these and gave them to my nice and nephews for their Christmas gift. They are a awesome tablet for the price.
Bought 2 for my nephews who are 2 & 3. Very user friendly even for them. A nice grow into tablet for an excellent price.
This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected.
My adaptor doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but there are no instructions. It looks pretty simple. So it just simply doesn't work.
works great for what I need it for. Great size for traveling! and great battery life! For only paying $35 bucks you definitely get your money's worth
Growing up I didn't have electronics but this thing is awesome for kids. You can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain things. Great buy
Simple to setup and use. Would love to see more Google integration.
After searching online for the best price, I found this on bestbuy.com. I ordered it and picked it up at our local Best Buy the same day. Great product at a great price.
great tablet! pros: good size (especially for travelling) android based so 3rd party apps can be installedcons: amazon ads will appear instead of a wallpaper on the lock screen, apparently you can pay to get rid of them which is just ridiculous can be slow when playing certain gamesnot a lot of storage space
i would not change any thing on it at all it works very good
I am loving my Amazon Fire Tv because it gave me the freedom to only pay for what I watch which was one of the things that really bugged me with cable tv. I used to have hundreds of channels available but also paying hundreds of dollars for them and with the Fire TV I just spend the dollar amount that I want.
The earlier models were so simple to use. No nonsense listing of books in it's library, by author or title. Now there are big pictures with tiny lettering and lots of ads.
I have this and the dot. Very little difference between the two other than size. Maybe it plays music a little louder thanks to bigger speaker but if this wasn't on sale I would've stuck with the Echo Dot. 4 stars because of the functionality of Alexa product in general
We think she's great! We're learning things every day!
works well with no problems and I am happy with my purchase
This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.
Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read
Easy to set up, works great. Love having music available on command.
Bought this just to have as a device to read my comixology account. Works perfectly for my needs!!
Works as advertised.l
This product is great, and I really like it. Especially for kids.
Amazing item that everyone in the whole family enjoys.
I actually bought this one for a friend as I already have one. She reads all the time, and I told her this is what she needed. I'm not even sure she has taken advantage of all the other options that come with it but she loves it for reading her books. She is an older lady so I help set it up for her and have not had to help her do anything else. She has been able to navigate thru it with no other help. Greatest gift I could have given her.
You get the most out of this if you have prime. Prime music is great with this, you may want to expand the memory with a card though.
This product definitely gets the job done plus more! Plus I couldn't beat the low price offered by Best Buy!
The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain.
I use this everyday. My entire family enjoys using apps.
Got this for my son, great inexpensive tablet for a beginner.
Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite - BlackVery cool, light weight and easy to use. Thank you.
Such a great tool. I really enjoy it. Voice control everything. We are still working on adding house automation with it, but its awesome so far.
expensive but good with integrated Illumination. has lot of amazon ads, and they asking to buy some new books that "suitable" for you! I had the old version with small keyboard and it was with 0 ads..
I liked it a lot for my four year old and it is kids proof
I love the ease with which I was able to set up and connect Alexa to the internet in my home. I set an alarm to get up to go to the gym, a reminder for things, ask her the weather and she wakes me with the trivia of the day - which is sometimes very amusing !! I also ask her the news, the weather and what's on my calendar for the day. Every day I try something new and am always delighted with her and amazed by each new attribute of my Echo. I have a Dot in my bedroom as well and plan to add one to my home office. I think I'm becoming addicted to these wonderful and helpful units.
Compared to the cheaper model this one streams a lot faster and smoother
The picture is great. The motion rate makes any old movie look new and amazing. Only downside is it takes a while for the app center to load and be ready.
This is a very nice tablet for my younger daughter and especially the price!!
I have macular degeneration that makes it difficult for me to to read. The Paperwhite allows me to set the font size large enough to read comfortably and the great back lighting really helps also.
Definitely worth the investment...I may get a couple of more!
This is the best reading tablet to date, crystal clear and bright
I love it! We have them for all our children and they love them
Easy To Use · Long Battery Life · Quality Build · Quality Display
About this as a present for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it because not only can she play all her apps but she can also use it to read her books
this is my second kindle fire I bought one of the first ones 6 years ago and when it started going down hill I didn't hesitate to go buy another one they last a very long time and work great. This time when I bought one it was much cheaper too but only in price not quality.
It's the best and closest you will get to a book but I still miss that feel of holding a book.
I bought the Amazon Fire 7" Tablet while walking around and saw the price 34.99 at the time. got home and set it up immediately and added the Play store app by Google ( a bit tricky ) the device is nice to hold , battery is above average and the screen is nice to look at. my kids started using it and after that , I couldn't even get a turn to play with it. it's a great device for the $$ , even at regular price of 50 dollars, it still is a good purchase. my only "concern" about it is that I wish it had another 1 gig of ram , totalling 2 instead of just 1 gb ram. enjoy :)
Perfect reader. Low back light means no eye fatigue. Could read all day and night if anyone wrote something new and interesting
Good for someone who loves music. The speaker is loud and I enjoy using it.
Honestly I see no difference in this and the iPhone.
My daughter loves her kindle! Seems to keep her busy!!
I was looking for an inexpensive tablet for my children to learn on, and found that they had dropped the price of the Kindle Fire to $50. This is an unbelievable price for a tablet with this many features.
This item is great if you have prime. I really enjoy it. I even bought my parents one. If you don't have prime. Get the Google home.
I bought for my grand child. She loves it uses it a lot
I'm using this instead of paying for a monthly satellite bill. It's worth it
got this as a gift for my boyfriend he loves that it is very convenient and easy to use.
This was exactly what I was looking for. It was easy to setup and to use. I found it even better than an actual book for reading. If someone is looking for a product just for reading a book this is the product to get. The only issue I had is it did not come with a recharging electrical outlet product so I had to use my computer to recharge until I got one. Now I can charge wherever without the need for a computer. If you want to just read a book this is the product to get. Can't go wrong just get the electrical outlet at the same time.
Handy size, easy to read in all situations and we can even send other documents than books to it.
Replaced my Kindle with this; it was a great deal for the price
Turns on and off fans, lights, water sprinklers, changes thermostat temperature and entertains.
My 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet.. I say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. At some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. He enjoys it - a lot!
Fire tv works great and user friendly. Great for watching movies
Great tablet for beginners, nice and simple. Great price
Great little tablet to travel with even for non-tablet types like myself. It can lag at times depending on what you are doing but great for the $33 I gave for it during the Thanksgiving sales
I brought the fire tv to get rid of cable. I'm able to watch all my favorite movies and tv shows.
More interaction is needed between other devices. Too hard to remember opening statements to get echo to respond.
More than satisfied with my Amazon - Fire TV. I previously had a "stick" and gave it to my friend. This product is FAR SUPERIOR. I love that you can use a wireless mouse/keboard via USB port, and have the option using WiFi or an Ethernet cable for network connection. SO MUCH FASTER when hardwired. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE CHOOSE THIS... Definitely worth the couple xtra $$
One of the best products I've bought in the last couple of years.
this is the perfect table to download books from Amazon....
I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.
we love this Fire Tv, just hard to find shows for now.
Nice and lightweight; the screen is easy to read. I don't like that half the screen on the menu page is taken up by promos instead of my library.
I have a smart TV but the Fire TV is faster and extremely more flexible. It is the best value of all units I reviewed. I have highly recommend the Fire TV and Fire Stick to my friends. They too have purchased and love it.
Great sound and syncs well with andriod phones. Good buy
Love the communications with alexa and the new home display.
We open the box. We download a book. It's like magic. The words the phrases the complete sentences. So cool!!!
This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music, reading books, watching movies, tv sports, tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa.
the box is very fast and doesn't have any buffering
Great tablet for price. Upgraded my son to this after we ran out of space on the Kid Fire.
It's doing a great job .. just go for it without doubt..
great tablet and great price that I purchase 3 for all my children. They have no complaints. And if it breaks I can easily afford buying a new one.
My wife loves her new Fire 8 tablet. It is easy to use and rubs quickly and smoothly,.
I wish it could stream music from my private NAS and not only from purchased online music sources. Need to buy hubs and other interfaces for it to control lights and heating
I purchased 5 units as gifts to my nephews and nieces and they love it!
Great for book lovers. Worth the investment given the cheaper price of e-books.
Still not able to connect to wifi so I am unable to give a recommendation.
Great Gift, can't wait to see my family's faces when they open this on Christmas!!!
Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.
best thing to buy, if your tired of having to pay high cable prices. Very easy to install. will be buying one for my parents as well.
Everyone knows "kindle fire". When these went on sale I grabbed a few up to use as kiosks for our PTA. Little did I know that fires run a "special" operating system, not a standard android. The 2 apps I needed to run were not available on kindle store. After much research I found a work around but it was very frustrating.
It was easy to set up and use and the screen is big enough to play games on
This is my second fire tablet so I knew that this product would do all I needed plus the newer version had some extras like a camera. Works great for me.
Great product works well especially enjoy the voice commands and the Ethernet cord works well. Love the apps and its very user friendly
My husband really wanted an Echo after using it at our son's house. I did not realize how much we would use it. I know we don't use all of the features - my favorite is the shopping list & the quick access to it on my phone. Little things help a lot.
works very well, small but not too small, very lightweright and paperwhite is very very very readale
This is a great product. My only problem is that it got to hot and had to return it.
I've often said that everyone needs staff. Unfortunately, most of us can't afford to have someone at our beck and call. Well with the echo and Alexa you can and there's almost nothing it can't do. Well except for picking up the dry cleaning, but I suspect an Amazon drone will do that soon too.
I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. I'm not one to buy Kindle books, but the ones I do have are certainly easy to access and read.
Look at this product as a portable speaker first and an Echo replacement second. The big reason to buy this over standard Bluetooth speakers is this has WiFi streaming enabled. When you are at home you can stream music with ease to it. Voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories. The only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice. If you want bigger sound and always listening features, spend the extra money on the Amazon Echo.
I purchased this for my children (ages 2 to 10) and they all love it and use it with ease.
I like the ease of this electronic. She helps me everyday
This is the second Amazon Fire TV device I have purchased, which I bought as an addition for another TV in my home. This device is great because it allows you to connect to so many different TV source (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Sling TV, etc.). Also, the processing speed with this device is great and a little better than the firestick that I have.
I just ordered mind 5 minutes ago is this the newest edition the 2015 kindle some of my friends got this and I heard it is such a great tablet
I I bought this tablet for my son he is very happy with it
I love this e-reader! It's even better as it has the background lighting so you can use it in dark areas
I purchased a fire stick months ago. I like the product but wanted something more. The Fire TV is the way to go. The extra money for the fire tv is well worth it.
gave as a gift along with the cover. person seemed to like it
I love this. Sold 4 Apple tvs including 4th generation.
I do a lot of reading and it's just right for that
Its good for what my son wanted it for,, games and books. Good price also
It's an OK product. Nothing special. Not on the cutting edge of technology
I have purchased the fire stick in the past. Now the box does everything the stick does and I can expand the memory which is a huge plus for me. Also being able to plug directly into a cat5 cable helps with streaming..
My daughter loves it. Parental controls are simple makes it easy when monitoring what my kid is in to
This box will replace cable, food and water. If it didn���t need power, I���d live for free!
This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice.
Kindle fire is good because of the other things you can do besides just reading books. But it is slow and hard to read in sun.
I had the original fire stick and I don't truly see that great of a difference between the new and older version. I was hoping that whe. The new version came out I could really understand and justify why I was paying more for a new one, when my old one worked just fine. Unfortunately, I can't. For me, it's not worth the money and I returned the item and stuck with my other one.
Love my kindle paperwhite! Love the no glare and small enough to be held with one hand!!!
something that will get very useful as time goes by, well made, and works great!!!!!!!
Nice set up. Hopefully they will add more apps. But I'm very satisfied.
I purchased this for my son and he loves it. He does vary basic things like play games and watch videos but it works perfect for that
Love my Alexa so much. Best Gadget ever. Very accurate. Can't get enough of Alexa. Love it so much I got the dot as well.
I feel that this tablet was the perfect fit for my boys age 8 and 6.
This product is handy and it sounds great when playing music.
I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. If you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.
U thought it was going to be like an iPad or Samsung but it's all Amazon mode and you can't turn off the lock screen ads!!!! I get tired of seeing them...
Bought a firestick and the box the same day. The box has larger memory so I don't have to worry about clearing my cache as often.
Currently building a house and went ahead and purchase the echo to start 'building' my smart home. We currently use it for just the basic stuff right now (music, timers, weather, random questions) and love it. My 5 year old daughter loves being able to tell Alexa to play her favorite songs so she can dance. I plan to purchase a couple of compatible thermostats next as well as some smart plugs that work with Alexa.
It is a great phone for a great price. It has the latest Android Lollipop 5.1.It also has 8Gb. of internal memory.
This was a replacement for one of the original Kindles I used. I enjoy this product much better. Screen resolution and backlight are excellent enhancements. Works great in bright sunlight. Touch screen works much better that old keyboard. Would buy it again in a heartbeat
The convenience is great, good sound. Great value.
great handheld device for starters and easy to handle
Easy to use. Kid friendly. Plenty to watch. Great price.
I liked it. Would be better if battery lasts longer. Great if you use Amazon or shop a lot there. I still love my iPad but Apple rips the wallet. I loved this tablet.
My kids love itBeats buying a galaxy tab that's double the price and compariable in my opinion.
This tablet was brought for my 6 year old an is great for just about everything an I love that I can put controls on it . An it was cheap
After going over all of the info on most all of the tablets on the market, I was having trouble deciding which one to get. But on Black Friday, for $35.00, for my first tablet, I was sold!
What more can i say it works great and it's cheap.
Bought this to use in my business. Economically priced and a whole lot cheaper than an iPad and does the same thing.
I got this for my X'mas gift for myself. It is good up to now. Very easy to carry and eyes don't feel tired after reading.
Good product for the price and if you're looking for a basic tablet this is perfect. I ended up getting an iPad mini 2 as well but this will suffice the basic user.
It's not HD but it does the job: Facebook, recipes in the kitchen, streaming Spotify and pandora, Bluetooth is nice.
Simple to set up and use. This is the second Fire 7 inch I have purchased. First one was for Mother-In-Law for Christmas. She loves to read and this tablet works great for her. I use this one mainly to play music through blue tooth speaker on deck. Battery life is very good. Also Grand kids love to play games on it.
Initially I figured this would be just a fun toy, so I resisted buying one for a long time. I finally gave in and kept my receipt in the event I needed to return it. I absolutely love it and even purchased the Echo Dot. It is a great way to tie all your smart home products together and to simply ask for something to happen. There are plenty of YouTube videos of unique ways to use Alexa. I use Wink (not too happy with it), but with Alexa, those products work very well. The speaker is excellent when you pair it to your phone to listen to music. Alexa is not 100% perfect and she does not always understand what you are saying, but it is improving.
Happy with this item. Able to use it with ease. Would recommend this item to others. Easy to download things too.
I love the voice commands, listening to music, books, or jokes! I've bought audible and house work goes by faster with books on Audible.
Item returned. Already had this item
My entire family has fun playing music and asking Alexa questions. A great purchase for our home.
Verified PurchaseI got the kids version because this is mainly for my toddler. I know, I know, yes I did get this for my toddler. He is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect.
Purchased it mostly to listen to music but it does so much more than I expected.
I purchased this Kindle Fire tablet as a gift for one of my grandkids. It has all the features they wanted on a tablet, plus it's so easy to use!
I bought this tablet for my son, he loves it. He used to look up everything on his smartphone, and watched Netflix on it too, but this tablet beats it with speed and overall performance. It also takes really good pictures. Every member of my family owns one of the Kindle Fire tablets.
I have to say this tablet is perfect for my young kids and durable!
There shouldnt be an 8 gig tablet. Not enough internal memory. Kindle Fire tablets work on a modified Android operating system. But other than that a good tablet for the price.
I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She has an older Kindle, and she can't believe how much better the Oasis is.
This item is the perfect tv radio treat I can ever give to my family they love it. Comes great and with everything you need to stay focused on the movies or tv shows playing.
I like this one because it has vocabulary list, you can save new words in vocabulary list and review them until you master new words.
This is a great e reader. There is no glare it is easy on the eyes.
Very affordable and it works. I bought this for my kids and they like it.
the clarity is amazing on this reader and the adjustable lighting tops it all off nicely
This reader is very light and works great. Would buy again.
love this newer kindle easier to read and brighter text
I love this thing!!!!!So much better then my nook.
its a great product its a must have in your household
Needed a tablet that I could use at night before going to bed that wouldn't have bright light and this does the trick.
Bought this for my child and has been exactly what was needed. A cheaper and possibly better option to the iPad.
This is the best tablet I have bought. It is better than the $200 kindle fire I bought a few years ago. It has wonderful apps for children as well as the great amazon apps I like!
my husband purchased a Fire tablet for me for my birthday I liked it so much I purchased one for him for a Christmas gift
This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier
Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need.
The best tablet . Better the Samsung . I have had 3 samsungs tablets and they all sucked and broke fast
I got this tablet for Black Friday at a decent price. It's 8 inches, you can add more space with a micro sd and very easy to use.
I bought the Echo based on a suggestion from a relative... it's got some nice features and the 'easter eggs' are fun to find. Sometimes I feel like I have to yell at it for the Echo to hear me and there's a large amount of stuff that it doesn't know (Amazon is working on that). I would definitely recommend getting a Dot as well if you are placing the Echo more than 5 feet from where you'd normally be talking to it from.
Love the kindle products. I bought the original kindle years ago so this is a nice upgrade.
Bought this for my mother who is not so savvy with tablets but this one made it easy for her to use.
I exchanged the paper white that I had bought for this Voyage. This is thinner, lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite. Still getting used to the archive system since I had a Nook before, bit of a learning curve. But I like the Kindle interface better than the Nook, the book suggestions and shopping for books is much better. The only thing I miss is that the Kindle doesn't tell you what % battery you have left, it just shows you the bar in the battery symbol.
The paper white feels kinda like real paper. The page is clear and bright. I love to read at night. It's awesome
I have been using multiple fire sticks for the past two years. The Fire TV blows them away in speed and quality. I would recommend it if you subscribe to amazon prime
Great asking headline news, weather and stock quotes. Play Pandora often too. Wish it would work when unplugged.
Its nice to have a companion that only talks when spoken to ,Alexa is the only women who doesn't argue lol
I bought the Amazon Tap when it was on sale. I already had the Amazon Echo and the Dot. The Tap was a pleasant surprise. Speakers aren't as strong as the original Echo, but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable. TheTap will do virtually anything that the more Expensive Echo can do – including hands-free voice commands. Plus, it's portable and has a wireless charger base, so that it stays charged. It is easy to set up if you follow the instructions carefully. It pairs with your home wifi network, and can also act as a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source.
Bought it for my grandson for Christmas and he loves it
We can't get enough of it! We use it daily and even our kiddo can use it.
Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank
This is a wonderful way to cut the cable cord! We have Amazon Prime, so our Viewing membership is paid, and there are so many TV show series/movies to watch, especially with Kodi loaded on the unit. We rounded it out with an inexpensive Sling membership, which gives us the live TV we need for current news and network shows. We are saving so much on our cable bill and couldn't be happier with our viewing experience!
Great price! Easy to setup and the kids will not put it down. It's very light weight too. I bought 5.
This product is not just for reading books. It works just like a tablet.
The Fire TV from Amazon works great! I have cancelled cable TV and am watching movies, news, football and etc. via Sling and the Fire TV. Takes some getting used to, but I would highly recommend if you want to save money on your cable bill and still enjoy TV.
good product for this price. I like my Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet
I have had no problems with the amazon tv. It streams fast and has a clear signal. And has a clear picture.
Great product. The only problem is that my son is now staying up late to read books in his bed at midnight without lights turned on. :-)
It's so convenient to ask Alexa anything with out having to get up.
I have found Alexa (echo) to be indispensable. I use her for my alarm clock. I play music to go to sleep at night using the sleep timer so the music shuts off by itself. And I use the weather skills several times a day. I just love this device.
We have so much fun using the echo almost everyday. We don't give command to echo, we talk to her (yes, echo is not an IT).
Buy this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it.
It kind of small yes, but very practical if you do not want to buy I pad mini
I never thought I'd be an e-reader person, always preferred a paper book. I am dyslexic and decided to try out this Kindle at the recommendation of a friend. I LOVE IT! I've read more books since I bought it last month than I have in years! Reasons it is perfect for dyslexics: You can change the font size, line spacing, margins, and the actual font. The last reason is the best. Recently Amazon added the Open Dyslexic font to the font options and it's fabulous! The next best option I found is Helvetica. Another thing that I like about the Paperwhite is that it has a matte screen, not a LED one like most electronic devices. It eliminates eye strain and the "blue light" issues at night. I also love that our library has the ability to borrow e-books, which has helped me save money on the books.
Bluetooth inaccessible if not connected to Wi-Fi. Device not chargeable hence not portable.
Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound
i bought this last year for xmas love it so much I bought another and I also bought the hd version.
I had the Fire model befor this one & it was ok, but way too locked down. This one is basically an Android tablet, with some key features added for Amazon. Little too baby for reading though, prefer my Paper White for that. But, great tablet for surfing, games, and movies/YouTube. The ONLY downside, won't connect over 5ghz (Wireless-N), stuck on the 2.5ghz connections.
Kindle fire has nice video quality, easily connects to wifi. Now has the ability to use micro sd storage for photos or videos. Micro usb keyboards also work by simply plugging in.
The young girl and boy that I bought the units for in Nigeria for school use just love them the price was great and they are being put to good use.
Our 11 year old daughter received this for Christmas and she seems to love it so fay. Does just enough to keep her entertained and I love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants.
This is the second Kindle Paperwhite that I have bought. The first is now in use by another family member. I truly enjoy reading with this e-reader. Is it easy to adjust text size and brightness, depending on your needs and room lighting.
I have owned a kindle before & prefer it to an ipad
Price was just right.i would recommend to someone.
This kindle fire does everything you need a tablet to do. Great picture and fast processing.
good product for a best price! highly recommended! 4K supported!
I've enjoyed using the features Alexa app and like the portability that this unit offers. The sound quality is good.
Good for beginners. Small for little hands. My 9 year old son loves it. He can read books on it. The video quality is great.
For those that have Prime this is almost a must have. Keeps all your Amazon stuff in one place.
It was easy to setup and fun to interact with Alexa.
My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price.
My son loves the tablet. I like that Amazon give you free unlimited downloads for two years
Great wait to watch TV and not have a hugh Cable bill. Wish I had this years ago
Had my first kindle (the original) for many years when I lost it. Love my new Kindle PaperWhite. Can read in the dark.
Purchased as gift for senior citizens, and they love them. Not to techy for anyone young to old to use.
This is such a great product! I am learning new things to use my Alexa for each day! The games she plays are fun and I especially like how she connects to all of our smart devices to voice control them! Would definitely recommend this to anyone!
flips between Prime, Netflix, and Hulu quickly and easily & lot more
Great easy to use great pictures great price. Awesome
The sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers. That however is really just the tip of the iceberg. If you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking. Also this works if you have Phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice.
Good for the price. Low memory but good descent graphics easy to use
Product works ok. It's user friendly. I don't really need or use it much after purchasing it. For those that like it ..what a bargain
Good price within batter quality love it works perfectly
I have several Kindles so knew what to expect. It is a great reading device and I keep several in different locations.
With Amazon Fire TV, you can access thousands of movies and TV shows instantly. Find favorites quickly or access weather and sports updates using the Alexa voice search...
the device works flawlessly... nearly indestructable for a 2 yr old... also comes with a no questions asked replacement policy through Amazon in the event that the screen breaks or something crazy
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video.
Great speakers and helpful turning lights off and on when I can't get up to do so. Also, I like that I can tell Alexa to play old time radio and Spotify.
Exactly what I needed at an affordable price! GREAT purchase!
There are definitely better tablets out there but being able to read books, surf the internet and play games for $50 is a no brainer.
Continuous updates make the echo up to date always.
This is one of the best kids tablets I have purchased. It's not as restricted and complicated to operate as other tablets I have tested.
My new Amazon Fire TV works terrific! Great for streaming TV service, PlayStation Vue.
This particular version of kindle is really good for reading ebooks.
Great device for tv show, movies, and supports 4k.
Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50.
Excellent value for my 3 yr old, everything you need plus HD and the wife can order off amazon prime, so happy wife and kid for the price cant beat it, 2nd one I have owned....
The camera not quality pictures but all else great
I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it.
Needed an inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.
Only one reason people buy these i for kodi. It's a great device and i love it i hated paying 100 dollars for it just because the sticks were sold out due to resellers
This device is very easy to setup and use and has great sound quality!
I loved this Kindle which is even better. It's a gift to a very important friend. Now he is unable to hold a book open with. He says that is easy to read but even lighter is wonderful.
I love my new Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite - Black. I would highly recommend it.
Great image quality, fast device. Jumped to this from Nook and would never go back.
We originally purchased the Echo to play music in our master bedroom/bathroom leveraging out Amazon Prime account. Now that we've been using it we've found countless uses for it. We're so happy with it we just bought the new Echo Dot. The speaker in the Echo is great. We purchased the Echo Dot for areas of our home that already had a good music system, but we wanted the other great features Echo has outside of playing music.
I love everything except that it is not compatible with ITunes
I am very pleased with my Kindle Fire except for the battery area gets hot after a while. I use my Kindle to read eBooks and holding it can get a little warm.
I'm glad that I bought this product, it's easy to understand, my grandkids loves it.
Perfect for travel and home. We have 5 in our house and everyone loves them.
Bought for my wife as Christmas present. She has early version of Kindle. She likes how little it weighs, and doesn't need a cover with separate light. She also likes swiping to turn pages rather than pushing a button. It is easy to read and has adjustable fonts.Only negative is after downloading a book, she has to search for it, rather than it automatically appearing on list of books.
I enjoy Alexa. It is very helpful. The news flash briefing is my favorite. I love that the device continues to learn.
We have so enjoyed our Echo. It helps me with my calendar, spells words for us, tells us the weather, etc.
The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
I'm an avid android user, however you'd be very hard pressed to find an android tablet of this quality in this price range. The quality of this Amazon Fire tablet is really great. It is not HD, but that doesn't matter to my 9 year old, who uses it to play games and listen to music. It has extremely robust parental controls, allowing parents to set a child profile and then set screen time limits, bedtimes, and limit content available. The child profile is actually a little too restrictive in my opinion, as I think my 9 year old could handle something in between full unrestricted access to amazon content and kiddie games only. Overall I am very happy with this purchase.
The tablet is good, the kids enjoy it, and is easy to use but the camera could be a bit more upgraded but for the price its a great deal.
Love this newer version of an e reader. I had a Kindle Keyboard and loved it. I finally wore it out after 5+ years. This Kindle is even better as you can read at night.
kid love this, it can use for multipurpose game, video......
A great place to start in tablet market good value
Bought 2 of these as christmas gifts, simple and easy to use.Both are enjoying it for web browsing/recipes. I set them both up prior to gifting them, i know it is an amazon tablet, having to create another account and use a different app store stinks...But worth the value.
The set up was complicated and I had to go to the Amazon web site to get it rightIt finally worked
The echo looks very classy and it works flawlessly and very responsive to voice commands
My wife uses & is quality product to use longer term.
My eight year old granddaughter loves it. Did research and the best deal was at best buy.
I was using a Kindle Paperwhite and when I saw this on sale for black Friday, I figure why not. I have been very pleased so far.
Not compatible with South African plug standards. Bought this unnecessarily.
Product works well but you have to put in all the product knowledge yourself and put the things you want it to know . I thought it did all of that by itself . But there are thousands of things you can enable for it to do. And it's very sensitive when your speaking to it and also will come on by itself from the TV. Not an expert yet and maybe those settings can be adjusted
I love how easy and fun amazon echo has made my home..learning more everyday to really benefit from all its capabilities.
This is my second PW and my 5th Kindle over the years. I don't know of a better way to consume books. Read on the Kindle, catch up on the iPhone, further on the iPad, and back to the Kindle.
I bought this kindle paperwhite especially for reading on the beach and have tried it in bright sun and it is amazing
I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
Replaced paper white with voyage...amazing screen!
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!
My daughter wanted this product for herself. I got this unit based on the price and size.
The bigger screen it so much better to do anything on. Games and movies are better because you can actually see them.
This is a great reader and has lots of new features. Go with Kindle Paperwhite.
It offers many more options than I was looking for. It is easy to use
I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more
Love the apps. His old fire stood up to significant wear/tear and drops. So I'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.
Movee very slow but it is ok for the price that i paid for it.
The doctor recommended that I not use harsh light products before going to sleep. I love to read books but my current tablet was extremely bright. The Kindle Paper White Tablet doesn't have the same glare and is easy on my eyes.
This is the little tablet that could!!!The price is a steal and the speed and function deliver. Not a great camera but functional. Not great for skyping but that aside a real bargain!
This Amazon Fire TV is awesome! Way faster than the stick.
Great dealing with Best Buy. They are always helpful when I ask questions, and honor all promises.
Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.
Easy to setup. Great peoduct. I want to recommend this product.
I would buy this item again. Fast shipping. No hassle.
This was a really good product. I really enjoy streaming movies and TV shows.
Little bit slow but perfect fit for my 6years old daughter.
Awesome gadget plays music answers questions tells the time.
The echo is fun and friendly and certainly helps with the kids math. Always fun to ask her random questions and try out new skills. Have one in all the kids rooms. Great for music listening.
Great screen, fast and responsive touch controls, and linked to Amazon for your apps. Overall, the best tablet you can find for under $50.
The fire 7 is the best low priced Android tablet in my opinion. The lack of memory is kind of disappointing, but it does have a micro SD slot and for the price you can't expect all high end features.
My 1st generation Kindle broke and I decided to replace it. The back light was the one thing missing from my first Kindle. The back light, long battery life, lightweight and ability to store 1000s of books made this an excellent choice for me. I almost never leave home without it.
My wife loves the Echo and we would recommend to any of our friends
It's a little bigger than my original one I had for my kindle fire, and the prongs do not fold up. But other than that, works great!
This was my third Fire 7" 2015 to purchase. One for me and two for gifts. The apps in the Amazon appstore are not a numerous as in other stores, but I've got email apps, games, office productivity, everything I "need". For a simple to use tablet it gets the job done very well. As an e-book reader it's great, but not outstanding. The screen is not as nice as higher end models, but for the price and quality this unit can not be beat! The speaker is mono and not as loud as nicer Fire units, but again this is a sub $50 unit.I use mine daily for email, web, some simple games, I've even sideloaded a few apps that work great (Your mileage may vary).Expect to like the unit for what it can do and you'll be happy. If you think this one is as good as a $150 tablet, well look elsewhere.All the sub $50 tablets I've seen out there can't hold a candle to this one's build quality and features.
The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. It works so much better than my Apple TV and I am a huge Apple fan
Really great product. It's pretty good! Did what I needed?
great gift have one myself, easy to use & carry!!!
Easy to replace old Kindle. Like larger screen and light
This is a great tablet, I have the Kindle Fire HD or something like that and I got this for my grand daughter. She loves it, I hate that she's only 9yrs. old and I have to add her tablet to my Amazon account on my tablet cause she doesn't have an email, cause you have to set up an account with email.
Fast shipping and great product Would recommend to friends
This is an awesome tablet, fast, great HD display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment. If you look for a great tablet for entertainment, surfing the net, or reading your e-mail, this is the best you can have. I also purchased a 128 GB SanDisk Ultra Plus memory card. I strongly recommend it, not for work but it’s great for entertainment.
have owned 2 kindles this is far the best. no light required. simple to use
Our household is an Apple household (3 iPads, 4 iPhones, Mac, Apple TV etc) but for the price of these tablets I gave this a try. I had low expectations due to the price point and didn't expect much as far as screen resolution etc...Set up was easy, linked with my Amazon Prime account easily as well...screen resolution doesn't compare to iPad Retina display but that's expected....battery life is ok but not on par with iPad...I use it for Ebooks as its smaller than my iPads and for checking Facebook etc if it's nearby.It can't replace iPad BUT...I bought 4 of them so everyone in my house has this small, functional tablet....Might even permanently mount as small TV screens in bathroom etc...
It's a great little tablet with good features but isn't worth getting h less you have Amazon prime.
Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get.
Easy to setup, more than acceptable performnces. I use the device to check emails, play, surfing the web and I never have any problems.Excellent price.
I recently bought this on sale at Best Buy for $34 on Black Friday and couldn't be happier. While I wanted primarily an e-reader (which this does very well) I also use my new 5th generation Fire 8 for Facebook, CNBC, Fox, and CNN news updates, Alexa queries, and occasional email. I added a 32gig micro disk and now store all my Amazon e-books on it (and yes, you can save all your e-books onto the micro disc. Just read the documentation as it's easy to do). While the Silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. I also added two security apps via the Amazon app store to keep me protected. They seem to work well so far. The screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while I haven't downloaded any movies yet, I'm confident they will play well. I should also add that I had to separately download an update from Amazon to install Alexa. While doing I needed to call Amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric, responsive, and helpful.
My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a "search" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that "this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me.
I bought two of these for my children. They are not powerful, they do not have a bright screen, and the battery life is ok. But they are cheap options for kids to have tablets and helps keep down the fighting. App store is not good, but keeps kids entertained and that is why I bought these. Great value for the price.
Great because I can play music from phone without battery go In down
Good product overall. I used it mainly to control smart switches (WEMO), ecobee, in addition to all the other "smart things" you can do. Having an IFTTT account is definitely helpful and compatible with certain products. Not compatible with Chamberlin MyQ Garage wifi opener.
product is good,,no complains better than the old one
Great item for watching all new and old movies and or tv shows.
I love it. I have several all of kids enjoy it and so do I
The fire is a decent tablet. It mostly uses the Amazon store so you are limited as to some of the apps. If you want something not HD to watch YouTube or search the net, then it is worth the purchase. For the price it is a well made product.
This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!
This is a good tablet! Kinda slow but what else do you expect from a cheap tablet? :)
Good for its purpose. lightweight travel companion.
The Firestick is awesome! Would highly recommend to anyone for their tv.
I like this product, particular the translation function that makes reading much smooth.
Bought this for my four year old niece and she loves it.
This is a great product . I bought it for my grandsons 12th birthday. It was super easy for him to monuva. He loves it
This is a great devise for reading books or taking photos. Best Buy Associate was very helpful.
This product is great. The customer service is great
This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend
Purchased as a gift - recipient has been enjoying the Kindle
I love that I can talk to it and get an answerI have recommended to my sister. now we can send a message to each
Amazon Fire tv is the best box, fast, good interface and simple
Perfect addition to our kitchen and can't have picked a better product for our home!
I bought this to have some extra features and compared it to my roku sticks and roku 2,3 and 4. I prefer the roku for netflix and the roku for many maybe more use friendly. However if you are looking for something that can do it all with more capabilities and features the Fire TV wins. I am amazed at what I can do with this little box. If you have not tried one do so.
Everyone needs one of these. Easy to use and fun to have
The 4k is pretty nice and they response time is nice. Wife uses this mostly. Haven't heard any negative comments yet. Got it to use for PlayStation vue.
Awesome speaker easy to set up. Easy to play. Great by the pool
good product for the price..Holds a decent charge and surfs the web just find..I have also steamed videos on this device with no issues.
Even better price. The paperwhite is awesome! Buy it!
This tablet is perfect for an adult and kid. It's worth the money. Inexpensive.
Very good tablet and easy to use. Its small a portable.
I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad
I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
I ordered this power charger at the same time I ordered my new E Reader. It works great, very fast. I was disappointed that it was an add on and not included with the price of the reader.
My 3 1/2 year old grandson son LOVES this "big game" as he calls it.
Price great for quality and versatility. Bought for son to use for streaming movies and reading books. Great product for him but had to purchase extended memory miniSd card.
Love for old programs or programs I have missed and navigation through some very interesting programs that are not on regular tv on pay per view
Great device for all your media needs. Plugs right in and ready to go and isn't hard to operate!
Extremely worth the money. Also with kindle they offer the underground app which gives you completely free games with in app purchases that are free. The same games cost 5 to 20 bucks on android and the apple store.For the price you cannot get a better tablet, I have had many tablets and for 50 bucks you can't go wrong.
Trying to reach the minimum required characters to get my points!
Alexa is like Siri for home. I love it! I play songs cleaning the house or play different genres for get togethers. She plays corny jokes that are funny, too. Anything you ask she pretty much knows. I recommend definitely.
Bought this for my 11 year old. He loves it. Has access to the Amazon underground store so he can buy all the apps he wants. I've set controls so he can't accidentally buy something with real dollars. A great tablet - way beyond expectations for this price.
This is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. The case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. Once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. Easy to navigate menus with great parental controls - this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. The key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling.
I got this for sister's son who is enjoying it so far with the apps and games.
My biggest gripe with it was the lack of directions. My first purchase went to the wrong card because I had no idea what the 1-click option was.
Bought for my kids for Christmas. Great tablet for the price!
great purchase very pleased with our tablet!!!!!!!
very easy to use. was bought to use with Kindle. happy with my purchase!!
I fabulous way to incorporate smart tv technology into a well performing pre smart tv. Great functions and great sound. Blows away Apple TV!!
I bought one, now my sister has one, my mom and three more family members. Easy to use and set up; I keep finding more uses for it. It is the center of my automated home and a good Bluetooth speaker, alarm clock and news reader!
Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters. They loved there first ones. time for a update
Bought this as a gift for someone but I haven't heard of any issues
Great e reader! Would recommend this over the other kindles.
The Fire is great for me. I do a lot of reading and now have WiFi abilities to get more books directly onto the system.
Bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it.
I bought this because I have Amazon Prime. This was really easy to set up. Picture quality is excellent. Better than cable or satellite.
Excellent tablet. Great product. Deliverd on time.
I got this product for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. He uses it all the time for reading. When I held it myself, I couldn't believe how small and lightweight it was. Very cool
This was my second e reader and I love it easy to operate along with a lot of apps available.
I purchased 3 (2 as gifts) recently believing all prior purchases would be compatible with the Paperwhite. I was highly disappointed to learn that interactive solitaire and word games I played on the old Kindle Touch were lost.
Great day reading. The backlight works great in the day as well. It is nice to have enough light to read wherever you are. The batterry life is also long
This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
Nice for working out or spending time on the riverbank. Great product.
Simple, everything works no problems. We bought for my mother in law . She loves it.
Way faster than the fire stick better over all connection
Affordable, versatile and easy to use whether it is for e-reading or searching the web.
I bought this unit for my daughter who loves to read but sometimes get frustrated by the size format of paper books and the weight of traditional tablets. The e-ink is super easy to read and the unit weighs next to nothing. A bit spendy for something you can only use to read on but so so nice to use.
Good for music and various information.Hoping the company continues to upgrade the technology so you can get directions and search for things on the internet.
I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that "hard copies".
Bought this fire for someone as a Christmas gift and it was the best gift given that day. It is perfect for any small online tasks one would like to do and absolutely perfect for reading books!
Great deal and wonderful product. Saving money on cabls
With the capability of apps and other things, my kids don't even touch my computer, this thing does everything.
This Fire TV works great. I would recommend having Amazon Prime Video and NetFlix. Also if you know anything about KODI you should DEFINITELY add that.
No problems so far.
No complaints so far. Great price, great tablet. Purchased an SD card so no worries there. I like it so much I'm going to buy one for my niece. She loves her games and books!!!
Really happy with it. Easy to set up and every day I find new features to it.
This is my second Amazon Echo that I'm adding to another level of our house and I couldn't be happier with these devices. From controlling music, lights, thermostats and the list goes on and on, life with Alexa and an Amazon Echo is much better!
purchase the box so I can save money because I tired of paying Time Warner. Best decision I made
My tablet is the best thing I have gotten from you
I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!
I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!
If you want a cheap nice tablet get this one! It does everything
Able to surf the net and facebook, but slow in those apps and you get all notifications that occurred since the last time you were on your Kindle even if you checked your facebook notifications prior to using the kindle. Excellent for its purpose of readING only. Which is why I bought it.
Quick delivery, great tablet, met all our needs...would recommend
Great for streaming and learning games for kids. Good research tool for older kids.
Bought this for my six-year old Daughter.Easy to navigate.The only knock is that is doesn't have expandable memory.
We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.
This is an inexpensive kindle that works great. It is a little slow loading which can be annoying, but I do love it - especially because of the price.
Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.
Great media player for the kids... video streaming is great and fun games to keep them occupied. Expand the memory with an SD card
I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old grandson. I took it out and set it up for hime before giving it to him. He refuses to put it down. I would recommend buying a very good case with it.
I don't like it, I would not recommend this to anyone
Gave as a gift to my wife. She loves the size. Good battery life. Now needs to find a cover for it.
My wife uses for watching movies, reading, Pandora etc...honestly does everything her more expensive tablets did.
Is a great tablet the only bad thing is the lack of space and you have to buy an SD card for extra space
Husband loves the 8" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading
Best box. Really like it so far and having 4 k is nice
I have several of these tablets and they are still my favorite compared to my expensive IPad. Best buy ships pretty fast and I am pleased with their online store.
Store salesman recommended the Fire over ROKU which I had history with. Stated that you get more with FIRE. What I find is that they are very different in how they actually operate. ROKU is more user friendly while the FIRE is more tech savvy and can be open sourced to some degree. One is good for very computer knowledgeable on how to manipulate software and the other "ROKU" is better at a user friendly interface that is more preditable.
We are so happy with the fire stick! Our friends kept telling us to get one and I don't know why we waited so long!
Fire worked fine and was simple to set up. I must add, however, that the overview menu should have more than a few on-line locations (Apps) like Netflix and YouTube. It should work as a main menu whose apps include things like liveTV, DiscPlayer, and even phonograph. Instead, it is pretty much all-Amazon. At least, if it was easy to access, it was Amazon. Aliza was not all that helpful either for non-Amazon material, certainly not for TV shows that are not in the Amazon library. I think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but Amazon. I was spoiled by my previous (Old Sony) BluRay Disc Player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything -- including Amazon. I may be showing my age and ignorance here, but I bet I have lots of company. I say KISS for usage, even if it means a more complicated install.
I wasn't sure how we would like the tap, but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke, play my favorite radio station or play music. The fun continues as I add apps and Alexa expands her knowledge base.
I am enjoying the Echo. I get news, weather and other information that I like each day. It is nice that I can also play the music I have with Amazon.I add new tasks all the time and I am still learning what I can do with it.
It literally speaks for it self!!! It's awesome to have something update me on news and entertainment! And the fact that it uses spotify for music as well, that's to awesome. I got it on my Birthday and told Alexa ( the echo's name) it was, and she said, " happy Birthday". That's Show's how personal it can get, then the other voice active products. The speaker works almost to well! I live in a 2 story town house, and the voice command can work as I'm walking down stairs. Just check the product out for yourself. You will want one!
Product has been great. We use the amazon echo for almost everything.
Its awesome and of course better than the last gen. Love the HD screen.
Definitely got the job done. This tablet is nice size and affordable
It works perfect with all the android apps, fast and never freezes or anything. No problems at all.
Very nice and efficient gadget that is so user friendly that even our young kids love to use
I bought this for my 12-year-old daughter. The camera, space, and design work perfectly for her. She loves it!
This is an very good to use in all areas. The letters are very clear.
I got this for my wife and she loves it. Screen is easy to read indoors and out.
You get Amazon access with this which is pretty good, but it won't compare to an apple or android device when it comes to apps. My son has one of these but his grandparents got him a samsung tablet and he doesn't even touch his Fire anymore. He says because the apps aren't as good. Its probably fine if you like amazon products, readers, etc. But not as much for a lot of the games.
This is the best way to go if your sick of cable bills. Movies galore on this.
Heard about the Echo and had seen it on tv. Absolutely love the product. Very fun.
it's and super cool device for music streaming. it's also voice activated.
For 7 year old. Now has two in different colors - can tell what is on which one by color.
I would purchase again. Great product for the price.
This is my first tablet. I has been fun learning how to use it. Great price.
Amazon nailed it. Its readability is superior to the book. The new page turning feature is a great improvement over the previous version. And, BTW, you can carry a library with you wherever you go.
I am satisfied with the Kindle Fire but would have liked a bigger screen model. Good for playing games.
The echo was very easy to setup but took a little time to figure out proper phrases to control devices. What amazon downplays though is that this is more of a gateway and does not control devices without network.
My grandkids love these, purchased 3 for the 6 - 7 year old. Per them "the best gift I got"
Great product for the price. It performs perfect for everyday use. My son likes it for his educational purpose.
Got two for my mom's and they love it. So many great features!!!
The Amazon Echo has very good voice recognition. It works just as advertised and is quick with the responses. I was glad to see it at best buy so I could touch it and try it before I bought it. The setup was easy and quick.
Turns out the Fire is much better than I expected. Well worth the $50 I paid for it!
Very useful products. I like very much . Perfect side . Very easy to navigate into
Enjoy the product. It works well. The whole family likes to use it.
This. Is a great charger. I like it better than the square ones.
I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed.
This is an excellent streaming device. It has all kinds of apps and other apps that you can download and you can even hack it to put Kodi on it. What I really like about the Fire TV box, over the Fire Stick, is that this box has an ethernet port, so you can connect it to the Internet, through a hard line, for a more stable connection than wifi, which means just about no buffering/load times, depending on the speed of internet you have. With wifi, you will have some more buffering/load times because the signal can fluctuate and go in and out sometimes. With the ethernet connection, the signal stays pretty consistent. Definitely recommend this.
Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet.
I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more
this is the best e-reader, great quality, great price.
I found the Paper white Kindle so easy to get used to. I always preferred paper books and could never get used to reading on my iPad or iPad mini because of the weight of them. The Kindle is user friendly and light to hold. I love it!
Great item! my grandchildren have had a ball with this!
Good charger
Actually easier to hold than a paperback, and might even be lighter!
It is little slow at start up. But once its up. it works great. For the price, it is a great device. I play basic games, they run smoothly.
Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size.
I bought this for my son to read books on and mybe play a few games. So far so good. No complaints.
My granddaughter loves this tablet it is durable..
Got for my grand sons for Christmas and they had a blast. Uploaded favorite games and loloaded music.
I've come from using a Roku and also a Nexus Player and this Amazon Fire TV blows the doors off of them. I do like the newer Roku 4 but you can't beat the price and features that this one has. I definitely recommend this one.
I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!
easy to use, plenty to watch. Easy enough to set up.
This Kindle Fire 7 blows away my other tablet for performance, battery life, readability, color, and many other options. I love this size as well!
This is my first kindle, and I am using it to read, play a few games, although not really a gamer. Over all I am really liking this kindle. Great deal too.
The tablet exceeded my expectations for $35. Kids love to play games on it and is great for social media.
I'm a cable cutter and Amazon Fire TV has been a God send. I have more content now than with cable. Highly recommend this producg.
What else can I say about this product other than it is truly fun and amazing. We spend hours finding new things to watch
I bought this for my 21 month old daughter and she has already learned how to use it. What a great way to keep her busy and quiet at the same time. Thanks
I am having so much fun with my Amazon Echo. I discover no features every day. I especially love the music and news
This is a good product and streams very well for all of our favorite online services!
Love the fire stick and the fire tv. We use the fire tv in our family room where our WIFI connection is weak. Streams beautifully!
Gifts for 4 yr old grandsons very easy for them to maneuver around.. great charge life. We have to force.them to take breaks.
Really impressed with this little device. It has all the. Ells and whistles including 4K UHD streaming in Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon Video. However, it does not stream in HDR ( not a deal breaker for me). Love this device.
I'm very with this kids friendly tablet. My daughter she uses my iPad and I decided to look one perfect for her...two years warrantee.
Have not used it yet. Salesperson did not sell me the correct cord so I could set it up.
I got a really good deal on the tablets. My kids love their tablets.
It's nice to go out in the yard and check my online stuff but it's just too small.
My previous tablets have been androids, so I don't care for the navigation on the home page. It has take some getting used to. However, it's nice to have an actual Kindle when I read my books, as opposed to just the app.
I purchased the Fire Tablet with expectations of a average performing tablet at best. I was surprised to see that the tablet performed way better than expected and is still doing so. I would recommend this tablet to anyone that wants a good performing tablet without a HD screen.
great learning tool for my granddaughter. she loves it.
Heck fifty bucks for a tablet a name brand tablet that feels premium not bad for the money!
I live alone, so I got this so I could hear another voice. I've got it programmed to play music from my era. It sounds great. I love it !
What a fun toy this is! It was easy to learn to use, and If I needed help, the online User's Guide is right there. Purchasing books couldn't be easier, and there's no "hard copy" to dispose of when you'e done. I was able to check out a book from the public library with little effort. With so many low-cost or no-cost books, as well as current best sellers, there's an endless number to choose from. You can use the search function to search by topic or title. I like using a stylus pen on the touch screen for that. I know I will enjoy my Kindle Voyage for a long time.
Plays music fantastically and has answered all my questions
This is amazing can easily move it from computer to TV. My kids love watching movies. Set up in seconds and ready to go.
My girlfriend and I have essentially become cord cutters so we had to find a box top set so that we could watch our Netflix, Directtv, and HBO. We got this because it was recommended by a friend. The user interface is simple and it works great if you have Amazon Prime. The main issue we have is when we forget to put it to sleep, which i recommend you do, is that the apps stall and don't start up right away. I'm not sure if it's the apps or the Fire TV itself. Its bothersome at times but it's nothing that we have to get replaced.
Works great. But could use more apps and less preloaded junk.
The ease of use is great, the features are great, Alexa Voice command works great, very pleased with the Amazon Fire Tv Box. AA
I didnt realize how much i would actually use this thing. she does everything. my 10 year old uses it for school. i use it for everything else.
My daughter loves her new tablet. Plenty of games and videos to watch
I love the size and the Light, to be able to read, anywhere, anytime!
Granddaughter loves it. She plays on it daily and downloads the games with no problem
The fire tv is great for those who have amazon prime and Netflix as it allows you to view thief 4K content that is included
The Amazon fire TV has been a joy to own. It has a very simple to use interface. I also love the fact that it is always ready in the background a simple push of a button and it wakes and it's right where you left off. In my eye it's worth every penny I paid for it.
This is a great tablet. My wife, my 4 year old son, and myself all use this. It is so easy to use, my 4 year old shows me all the tricks. Amazon is even easier to use which we really enjoy. I would not recommend the Nuprocase however that I think we got from amazon.
Amazon echo was a great choice. Get your money's worth.
Easy to use for kids and elders. Very Basic functions.
Met and exceeded all expectations! Easy to use, perfect size, arrived when expected and an excellent value.
Great starter tablet for my 9 year old daughter . Its has everyhing she likes from games, music, to movies. She loves it and cant out it down . Great tablet !
We purchased a couple Amazon Firesticks first to facilitate cutting the cord. The Firesticks are ok for bedrooms or less used TVs, they just don't perform as well as the more powerful Amazon TV Box. I will be purchasing another one for the movie room. It's been great cutting the cord. But the one thing I'm waiting in is for Hulu Live to make it over to the Amazon platform. They keep saying soon, so patiently waiting. Hulu Live looks to be much better than our current Sling service. Other than that the box is great and that one issue might be Hulu or networks holding it up.
This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting
Bought for my grandson. He loves playing with it and enjoys the videos.
This is an awesome box to have. Makes it easy to watch all your shows.
I was going to buy Roku 3 but the team member suggested buying Fire TV instead. I'm glad I did cause you can get Kodi on this and it's still got HBO and Netflix. Works great!
For the price I paid not having HD on the kindle was no matter. Has lots of storage and the kids are using it at school for their class assignments. Screen is big enough to read off of and everything is loading fairly fast. Kindle looks to be durable.
Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
My wife use the echo every day and it's gotten 10 times better now that we've added the Philips Hue and Nest Thermostat in with it!
I originally bought the more expensive, Voyage model, and I definalty prefer this one. It is much easier to grip, and is doesn't get as smudgy. I could not tell much difference in the screen quality, the major noticeable thing was the Voyage has a smooth screen, and this one is a little rough to the touch, but that doesn't matter at all.
For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!
My wife loves it and won't let me use it. I may just have to go get my own!
I was previously using a first gen Nook e-reader. This is crisper, faster, and MUCH better battery life. Plus it goes on sale every once in awhile.
I've had every Kindle since they came out and have been impressed by the innovation, design, and overall quality. This one is the exception on all counts. Lightning issues on the bottom of the reader are distracting and I don't see a visible difference from the older models. Evidently, production is of higher value than quality.
Bought this for my 7 year old so he could play games on those looooooong hockey game car rides -- this tablet was more than enough for what we needed and the app selection is good in the Amazon store! No complaints here!
The antenna with power booster pulls in more than 30 HD channels. It takes very little room and works very well. Great for supplementing cable on other sets.
bought for daughter in law and she likes it. she wanted a fire
What impressed me the most was the amount of free kids apps that you get with the Kindle. These are easy to use in both size and software.
Nice for watch nexflix play games best item i buy .
Lacks a lot of the info so readily available on Google Home
Definitely a good learning tool for children. Easy
This is my third one, don't use anything else for reading books.
The Kindle Fire will not disappoint - durable and easy to use. We have 4 kids using them all tied to the same amazon account. So convenient!
Has a timer for how long your kids can be on the tablet
Each time that the Kindle Fire needs to be unlocked, an advertisement pops up on the screen. To remove these ads cost an additional fee, so be aware that this is the case. I have owned Nooks previously and they were more flexible in usage - such as being able to read epub books easily, for example.
Sometimes the screen is not as responsive as I would like it to be but it does what we need it to do and our daughter loves it.
The Fire is a fantastic tablet and is so economical. My granddaughter loves it!
I bought this for my father for Christmas. He has a smartphone, but the screen is getting a little too smail for him to read, so I thought I smaller tablet might be nice. I was right. He absolutely loves his Kindle!
My husband is enjoying this tablet for reading and netflix.
Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one.
The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful
It took less than five minutes to set-up and start using my Kindle. Features are easy to use and it's holds a charge for an incredibly long time!
I have recommended this product to everyone I've talked to. It's easy to navigate and and allows me to mange my TV time.
Lovely upgrade for my sister from an old iPad gen.
Hook-up and set up is simple. You are able to watch TV quickly after set up! I was pleasantly surprised by the app options. I no longer miss having satellite!
Like I said it's very gimmicky unless you plan on turning the house into full automation tilts just gimmicky
Me and my Boyfriend naught this for his niece so she could play games on it. She liked being able to have us download games to help her spell on it v
We bought two. One for a university student, the other for an 11 yr old. No more waiting for books in the mail! Books are immediately downloaded. They are able to run Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, Pandora etc not choppy, immediate loading. TToonnss of apps. Many free. They are surprisingly durable, more than my son's iPad. The battery life is good. Thinking about buying another.
More positives than negatives on this one. Battery is great, readability is great. The backlight makes low light reading super. The only thing that would make this even better would be water resistance.
I bought the Kindle Fire HD as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has never had a computer or Kindle. She loves it. Best gift I gave her. She plays a lot of games on it. That keeps her mind working. Love the size of screen.
It is a good cheap tablet. Lacks in performance but acceptable for price
This is a great item for use is household and kids
Cheap tablet that runs great and plays hearthstone silky smooth
I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
I'm very pleased with my fire tv purchase. It was highly recommended and it indefinitely delivers. So many tv shows and movies are available, now to find the time to watch them all.
It's processor is super fast plus plays movies & tv shows so clear! I love it!! Best money I ever spent!!
Nice size screen. Very fast easy to use nice size nice screen
Got this tablet as a gift for my mom, who is 72 and is a little not used to high technology, so she uses this tablet mostly for Facebook and reading an e-book. Works fine, but if you are an user that likes high resolution screen, plenty of storage and fast processor, this is not your choice.Good streaming can be done though.
We had one before and it was stolen so we got another and loving it as always, great thing to have on the go or when you don't want a bunch of books all over
Was looking for streaming device. Weren't sure if I want to pay $100 for 1 but it was on sale for $70 so decide to buy it. Did research and found it allow me to install dev app to connect to other server source for streaming so bought it instead of roku or apple.
I have enjoyed my Kindle. I am an avid reader and receive savings on my books. Love the ability to select font size too.
Text is very crisp and easy to read. Would recommend to others
Fast, solid, all the necessary features for an ebook. I like the side pressure page advance and the small size fits my small hands.
The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.
I have bought multiple fire tablets and will continue too. I would advise to get the protection plan for any problems and we have had a few. The tablets work good for the most part but I would upgrade the memory to 16 if you are going to play a lot of games.
Love my new Kindle Voyage. I have an original Kindle but this one does so much more. Recommend it highly.
We are pretty unhappy with this purchase. Several of the most popular apps (Instagram, You Tube, etc.) are NOT compatible with this device. Now I know why the sale on this was so great. We can really only run the internet and Facebook on this device. Will be returning and getting a different tablet.
Purchased Amazon Ech and for a few days found myself using Alexa (virtual assistant) a lot. It was a lot of fun however, after a few weeks I rarely use it. I think because I use more apple products, Echo is not always compatible with things aroumd my house. It is nice to have when you need quick information (if your phone is not nearby). Alexa responds very quickly, soumds great, looks great, and has some fun skills. If you have products that you can use in pair with Echo to cut on appliances or lights, you will use it a lot more. Overall a good product!
I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!
Very fast at loading apps and downloading movies and TV shows. Would highly recommend. Also have a firestick and the box is much faster and has more memory.
My daughters had been talking about the Amazon Echo for a while! I made the decision to purchase them each one for Valentine's Day. They are loving it!
It's great I gave it as a gift to a family member and they can't get off of it .
I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
Far exceeded my expectations. Very simple setup. Having Amazon Prime makes this purchase a "no brainer"
This is my second Kindle Fire and it is even better than the first.
We love our Echo. It has been a fun toy for all in the family. She updates us on weather, plays music, tells us the news and even tells us jokes!
firebox is small but fast, runs great and takes no time at all to set up
Very little storage, Amazon Android skin bloated and too many ads
Needed to upgrade from the fire stick as it was too slow and dying from at least a years worth of being used
Use it everyday for getting weather forecasts, laughing at jokes and so much more!
Bought for our child who has vision issues but LOVES to read. ❤ She can borrow library books and they return "automatically". Appreciate that the screen lighting is more gentle than other tablet items. Grateful for no game options. Wish I could control the ads better! That's my only complaint. Some advertised books are plain wrong for a young one but there it is with a sample or picture. Just gotta keep an eye on that.
Absolutely adore my Echo. I am always skeptical when my husband brings home new fancy technology but Alexa has not disappointed. I love having my music in any room of the house and I am able to control the song and volume without having to touch the Echo. Makes my life soo much better.
Love it working great on my 4kTV real easy to use.
I feel like I have been completely lied to about this device. Despite reviews claiming a hands free mode that does not exist in the settings. I just downloaded the app for the first time today and there is no hands free option to enable in settings. And Pandora said it's not available in the US on this Amazon tap. Thanks for ruining a birthday Amazon
I ordered two for my grandchildren for Christmas and decided to get one for me on the black Friday deal because I couldn't beat the price. I've been using it for about 1 week and so far I am really liking it and my grandkids will love it. They only issue I've had is the 3rd day I couldn't get it to charge so had to do a hard restart but now the charger cord that came with it no longer works but its too short anyway so I use a micro usb cord I had. I've read that this is an issue with these but who doesn't have an extra micro usb cord laying around.
I have to admit that I was quite surprised by this Amazon Fire tablet. I have been using Apple, Windows, and Android for the past few years and never gave Amazon a chance - until a Black Friday deal at Best Buy.It is responsive, visually great, and the OS is quite easy to navigate. I set this up with my younger son in mind, and the parental controls are superb. They covered everything I could think of to prevent him from doing. Amazon also has plenty of cases to choose from for their own tablets.The only thing, and this just may take time, is that I wish the app library was more extensive compared to Apple and Android. Other than that, everything else is Excellent!
Very slow, freezes frequently but it was 34 dollars
If you like to read, this is an excellent choice. Battery life is weeks even with the backlight in use. Contrast is great both inside and in direct sunlight. Most municipal libraries have loads of free books in the kindle format so the device effectively pays for itself in short order.
Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she's not tech savvy.
Purchased for our niece. She is 6 years old and it's perfect for her. She loves it!
Android unfortunately always is buggy and whether its nexus or amazon they have the task of cleaning up the bugs and unlike some people I am not complaining. The bugs will be fixed soon just like the first one. Anyways...this device is giving more everything at the same price. Thanks Amazon
I purchased this pad for my boys. It is an excellent pad for a great price. They use it for all the popular apps, along with their favorite games. Sound, picture, and the touch screen are all great. I couldn't be happier with my choice. If your looking for a great pad at a great price, look no further, this is the pad!
I got this for ky 3 year old and she loves it. She has dropped it a fews times, once outside and it just bounced. I also love that I can set restrictions on play time, I can have it where this is no play time until a certain number of minutes of reading time has been completed. I don't have set times of the day that she can even get on it
I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix.
I am very happy with this tablet. It was an upgrade from the Kindle paperwhite. The screen is very sharp, and the tablet is very lite.
I love my Fire because it's so easy to buy\\review books, movies on plus shopping is a breeze, as well as downloading apps. I would'nt give mine up for the world.
This was bought for a first time user of any type of computer/tablet. He found it very easy to work with and enjoys it very much
Enjoyable to have so much music so readily available. Also great to have songs from back in the day so readily available. Having a weather forecast at voice command helps things run more smoothly in the morning. Very convenient to have a timer available even though your hands are sticky with dough or meatloaf. The ap is also good for finding new skills.
Unlike my Kindle 2nd generation which requires an external light to read, the Paperwhite can be used in the dark.
Great product!! Love sound quality. Love being able to control Dish Hopper.
This amazon fire box works great. I don't have cable, we use the apps and Netflix that is connected to wifi. Easy to set up. We have one in every room.
Its exactly what I am wanted and the price was fair
My son loves it. It is easy for him to use. He doesn't want to put it down.
I absolutely love the fire tv box... It's amazing!
Battery is nice. Screen looks amazing. Couldn't have asked for anything better.
The paper white is great after a day on the computer at work. It's so much easier on my eyes than a tablet. Love it.
My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working.
Love the compact size and ability to read it anywhere.
picked up a tablet because my laptop is over 3 years old, does a good job, sound levels are good, nice picture for a non hd product. Lots of pre installed apps and the ads on the sleep screen are annoying but for around 50 bucks not a bad product.
Found this tablet to be very intrusive with adds, almost forced to use credit card to make things work.
Great tablet and price for my four year old she really enjoys it
Hulu, Netflix and more on this device. Ethernet cord from router straight to the firetv device is 10x better than connecting wireless
I love my firestick. We choose not to do cable to save money in our first apartment and it has been great with the firestick.
Recommend anyone wanting to watch a wide variety of things from movies, TV shows or sports to get one.
My wife was the one who wanted this item. It unpacked easily and setup was a dream. All you need is an Amazon account to start. It responds quickly and has unlimited potential. My only gripe is that you have to look up the skills but I suppose someone will figure out how to overcome that. It is always listening and will turn up or down the volume by command. We are still having fun playing with it. PANDORA AND IHEART are the best!
Love this gadget!!! I highly recommend it!!! Easy to set up too :)
This is a great product if you wanna break away from the expense of high cable bills.
A lot of tablet power and features for the price. Kids will thank you.
What a nice little helper for answers to immediate questions! Weather forecast in an instant.
It is very easy to set up and use. It has great functions, but am waiting for more to be added to give 5 stars.
Really expected a chord with it for the price we paid. Very dissapointed.
The only thing that I didn't like was that I had to sign up with Amazon Prime in order for my son to get unlimited games. I ended up paying a little bit more.
I was a bit skeptical at first, but the reviews were right. The Echo is great piece of technology! I need to add more smart devices to fully appreciate the capabilities,but great for facts, music, news and weather.My kids love it and my wife too!
I purchased this for my teenage daughter. She is constantly reading, but was using her cell phone.So glad I got this for her. What a difference! Free shipping and super fast delivery.
was skeptical at first because I thought it would be the same as the fire stick.Boy was I wrong.4k is awesome on my 4k tetevision.
I purchased two for my nephew and niece. They love it. My little nephew is having lots of fun taking pictures. Great tablet and affordable price.
I bought this for my sister as a birthday gift and she loves it.
Bought this for my dad and didn't want to spend a lot since I bought another pricey tablet before for them and works just as good!
Small, light weight and easy to read. Read in the bright sunlight with no glare and read in the dark without disturbing anyone.
Tablet work like charm and I never have issues with it
Source of information and entertainment for the whole family! Would definitely recommend.
I were told about the fire stick tv from a friend so went to a best buy store to buy one.the store had to order me one I had it in my hand in two days and I have been enjoying it. Use it everyday.
Easy to use and great selection of books movies and games.
Love the Kindle great for my children...and also for my older kids
I recently bought the Amazon TV because my PS3 was having difficulties streaming Playstation Vue. Therefore, the primary reason I bought it was to stream Playstation Vue. It works flawless. Additionally, after setting-up Playstation Vue, I began to download a ton of different apps and use it a lot more and for a lot more streaming services then I had originally planned. I would for sure recommend it for anyone wanting to stream any shows. It is a excellent device and easy to use.
for an inexpensive tablet it works great. does the basics very well.
This is great for someone who LOVES Amazon and has prime. The video playback is in HD and is spectacular
This tablet works very well and the price is excellent. I bought for my nephew and he is so happy.
Started with fire sticks as I thought cheaper was better option then I got to see one of these in action. So much faster.. definitely would recommend.
I love my kindle so much. It has a great screen clarity. Also the price was on point.
This is a really good product, super fast and great screen, would buy it again!
For me it is too small. I would prefer it to be 8".
This was a gift for some kids in my family. Great tablet for reading and playing games/apps.
this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media
For $50 the kindle fire 7 is a bargain. I had the original kindle and the difference in functionality is night and day. The only minus is amazon prime is now $99 a year and it's hard to justify that unless you shop amazon alot. But still overall a great deal.
Works great, he can enjoy his apps without interruption. Now we just need one for his younger brother since the only negative thing is that he wants to take it away every day.
So what they have adds. My wife got it for $50 and I know on Black Friday it was $35. Where else are you going to find a color screen for that price. It works well and couldn't be happier.
Love it. Great for kids. Gave some to nieces as gifts
I actually didn't think I'll be using the Amazon Echo as much as I do when I decided to buy it. It's definitely become a something that's called on for everyday purposes from playing music to checking traffic. I don't really have any complaints except for that the Echo doesn't hear me use its wake word so I feel like I'm screaming at it before it takes action. Overall, very satisfied.
This is my second Echo. The first one I purchased at Home Depot for 139. I knocked it off my nightstand a few times with no damage. The last time it fell, it completely died. So now it's just after Christmas and they are few and far between to purchase one. Amazon has a back order for almost a month for 179 and eBay tries to rape you with prices up to 300. I finally gave in and purchased one for 200. I love the Echo and all the accessories that you can purchase for it. BEWARE, buy a stand or wall mount for your Echo and protect your investment. My mistake the first time. If you have pets, you can count on it being knocked over. There are too many components inside the Echo to be abused. That is all.
Perfect product that met my needs and expectations.
Great product. Easy to read on without feeling like you're staring at a computer screen. No glare at all no matter where I am. Very easy to hold whether reading sitting or laying down. Highly recommended!
I bought two of these for my two grandchildren. (A 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl) So, I bought one in pink and one in blue. We down loaded age appropriate games and they are lifesavers!
The amazon echo definitely meets expectations! Easy and fun to use!
I purchased this on sale for about $38.Worth every penny and more! Not only do my regular Kindle books look awesome backlit but now I can by or checkout from the online library comics and graphic novels as well as tv episodes and movies. It looks great and (after a year or so) I will be ready to upgrade to HD.
Great tablet got the money plenty of features and easy to use and big enough to ser
We were hesitant to buy an electronic reader, but started to accumulate so many books we ran out of space to store or give away.So happy to have the KINDLE and can share on iPad so often we are reading and discussing the same book! Love it!
Was looking for a tablet with expandable memory that was reliable. Amazon Tablet was the best choice
We use it so often - especially for music! We also use it for timers, controlling lights - we can't live without it!
I bought my fire tablet during the Christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging iPad. I am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video. I added an inexpensive SD card to download videos and shows. It is great for travel.
They love it from the kids. I have this by myself it is really good I would buy it for anyone
I love it everything is in one place. I do recommend buying this you will not be upset
There was a lot of proprietary stuff that takes away from the actual usage of the device.
I decided to buy this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it. She uses it daily and had no problem setting it up by herself! For someone who sucks with technology she has no problem with this tablet and it is a nice size.
I updated my kindle touch to this. I loved the price. I got it a few months ago for $50, which is still an affordable price for a kindle. I love the Bluetooth and text to speech features coupled with the fact that it has an expandable drive. Those features along with the price were what I needed. Oh did I mention the resolution for watching movies is good. The camera is not the best, but I didn't get this for the camera. Matter of fact I got one on Black Friday as a Christmas gift for a friend.
What can I say, for 50 dollars this tablet surprised me. I did buy it during Black Friday when it was on sale, yet still worth the 50(regular price). It may not have the best screen resolution nor screen size yet it runs smooth. I have been able to watch Netflix and play games on it with no problem. Plus your able to expand the storage up to a 128gb that is crazy. This is going to be my travel tablet and I did buy a second one for my cousin for Christmas. I think overall for 50 dollars you can't complain and am very happy with the purchase made.
Product works well but has more potential than is currently offered. A bit difficult to set up on households sharing a Prime membership. Lacks flexibility with your I tunes library unless you want to pay Amazon to access the songs you already own. Hopefully Amazon will get smarter. Highly recommend the product.
It's a nice idea if you have a need for such a gadget. My opinion was it wasn't worth the money. Computers and smart phones do mostly the same thing so why have an additional gadget. It might be more worthwhile for someone that wants to use it for running smart gadgets around the house. Not for me so I returned it.
purchased for my mother-in-law for Mothers Day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her!!! just touch the pic!!
Christmas present for the spouse which she asked for. Happy wife equals happy life.
bought this for my wife's birthday and she loves everything about it!
I purchased the item for $33 and was shocked when I began using it that the battery lasted 10 hours with moderate use, came with 6 months of free newspaper subscription and was preloaded with a lot of features. Its not the fastest in the world and I would prefer more storage, but for the price and considering how well it works I'm giving it 4 stars.
Easy to use, great gor reading, easy to download books
I had a kindle Paperwhite that I'd bought in summer 2014, and by summer 2015 something had gone funky- it wasn't charging anymore. So I upgraded to one with a higher PPI a couple months ago. The difference is slight; in fact I haven't noticed it at all. If I went back to my old Kindle I'd probably notice that the quality had changed, but really, it's a very minor upgrade. But that doesn't matter- because the Paperwhite is awesome anyway! I am a woman, and I can fit it in the back pocket of most of my jeans (so dudes definitely can), it slips into small purses and it holds a charge for weeks. I have a pretty big collection of physical books, but I really enjoy having a library on a tablet that I can bring with me too. I buy physical books when I want to linger around a book store, or for poetry, or books that I want to high light or share with people, or that I like the covers of. I buy Kindle books that I really want for the story, or that are on sale on the Kindle store, or classics that are cheap (a couple bucks) or free. The Vocabulary Builder is really nice- I just highlight and lookup words that I want to know more about, then it provides a definition for me and saves the word as a flash card so that I can practice later at my convenience. I use my Kindle at night- the back light is perfect for reading right before bed. I wholeheartedly recommend this device if you just want a reading tablet. I might get another tablet for watching TV or playing games, but I just wanted a dedicated reading one, and this is perfect for me.
My youngest daughter is very pleased with this tablet.
Easy to use. Lightweight... can easily read in low light / night.
My old kindle was on its last legs and I needed a multi finctional tablet that was also a reader. The Kindle fire fit the bill excellentlty.
Bought if for my 6 year old son. Has plenty of space. Long battery life. It's durable and hasn't broke when dropped (I'm going to buy a case though!!!)
I do most of my E-reading when we travel. I always used my I Pad, but finally replaced that with the Kindle (for reading). Nice to be able to read in the sunlight, which is not possible with the IPad. The light is also not as harsh as the IPad when reading at night. So now I travel with both.
It make take a little getting use to, but it is very helpful.
Needs more apps and has bugs that need fixing.....
A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.
I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.
I love this item...I got it for my grand daughter for Christmas and I am sure she will love it also...this is her first tablet and it has all the features she'll love!!
We keep trying to find songs she doesn't have and only found a couple.
My granddaughter loves her tablet. She has learned how to play both educational and recreational games. Will be very helpful in the future.
Very good voice activated music player. I anticipate and look forward to the integration with Sonos equipment and my music collection.
Granddaughters really enjoy their gifts. It was reported the house is quite because of increased reading and game playing. Taking trips in the car is quite and pleasant.
I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot
This tablet I can read all the letters and words on so it is pretty good. I hate the ads on the lock screen the goverment doesnt need to know when I READ MY DIGITAL BOOKS>
The Fire TV is much faster than the Fire Stick. It's super-compact. It has a better antenna, so it can pick up the wifi signal from farther away than the fire stick. It also supports 4K streaming and has more memory than the fire stick (this means gaming capability). The only downsides are: you must sign in/create an Amazon account (which is free), it doesn't come with an HDMI cord (which is required for use), and it doesn't have expandable memory. Overall, it is well worth the price and I would suggest spending the extra $60 and purchasing the Fire TV instead of the Fire Stick.
This is the second Fire I've owned and have found them to be a good reliable tablet.
This is my 2nd purchase of this tablet! But for positive reasons I bought one and had to buy one for my daughter also she loves it, the apps the games and music work fine with and without wifi!
Great product for night reading! Light and friendly.
Had a fire stick and loved it. Eventually got this because I wanted the 4K capabilities. My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner. I use it for sling tv a lot as well.
I really love the tablets my kids love them.I recommend then to other people.
I enjoy this product. I wish it did more. It was a Christmas gift for my spouse and they enjoy it.
Great little tablet for the money. Used some rewards certificates to pay for most of it. If I was to do it again I would buy the 16GB version. Very happy with the handy little tablet!
This thing is great, I can get all my music, weather, sport scores and more
I got the Fire Stick and had to return it because of the lag. Not enough RAM to run smoothly. The Fire TV however is great. It runs plenty fast and being able to Bluetooth sound to an external speaker is awesome. I rarely use my tv speakers any more. I highly recommend the fire tv!
Grandkids love it! It's very easy for them to use. They enjoy reading and playing games!!!
It was a nice tablet for the price. It's a nice beginner tablet and a good tablet for children.
Great product!! It was easy enough for my ten year old to use. Also it was easy to set it up for her. I highly recommend it for the price!!!
Great tablet for the price well built and worth every penny
The fire tv is great for streaming videos from various services. The amount of content available, allowed me to cancel my cable subscription.
I bought 2 of these. I didn't want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.
Great little tablet, fast, does a lot but does not do it all. Missing Google Play Store and screen is only ok. Price cannot be beaten
For the price you have to deal with a lot of pre-loaded stuff, but it is a great price for a capable tablet.
My parents had a Kindle Paperwhite they were sharing and loved it so much they wanted another one so they wouldn't have to take turns anymore. Unless you're looking for the full Android experience with the Fire or FireHD, this is the best Kindle model - the Voyager model doesn't add enough to justify it's higher cost. My tech-adverse mother absolutely adores her Paperwhite!
You can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.
Works as described very portable with wifi and Bluetooth
I had a kindle fire that was about 4 years old and wore it out. This was purchased to replace that one and I love it. It is a little lighter and smaller. Still has all the great features and you cannot beat the price for this small tablet. I highly recommend it!
For the price, it's tough to complain but it does occasionally stutter or get slow downs. Overall, you can't find a tablet at this price that will outperform but if you do have the extra money, I would use it for the new Fire HD 8 instead.
We bought them for our kids but they are good enough for us to play too
Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.
I was quite surprised by the ease with of setting this up. The voice control with Alexa works great, far exceeded my expectations. Great picture quality and a good selection of shows and movies.
The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.
I like the Amazon Tap because it is portable. I have used it several times and it makes things a lot easier.
Gave as a gift, they love it! There are new things to love about it everyday!
Two improvements needed. Better browser, it is awkward to use to connect to library. Also want to see black background with white lettering for night reading
We had recently purchased a home w/ speakers thruout but needed to add a receiver. In the meantime, we heard about the Echo and thought it might be fun and also provide a means to have music in our pool room. The sound is so good, we have decided to not spend a lot of money to run the speaker system in the house! The set up was well documented and had no problem getting "Alexa" up and running in a short amount of time.
This is a great streaming device. Definitely worth the extra cost compared to the fire stick. Apps open instantly and operates flawlessly.
We purchased 2 of these for our children. They find them easy to use
Had the older model that didn't light up... Was always having to get to a lamp. Now I can read anywhere without any worries. The light adjusts as needed. I get lost in my book without any worries. The screen is perfect size with great clarity and easy to travel with.
Easy and fast access to all popular apps. Appreciate the voice search on the remote.
Working great so far. Battery holds a charge much better and longer than old regular Kindle that we had. Best Buy did match lower price that they advertised days after I purchased this one. Very satisfied with product and Best Buy.
I've had the stick but upgraded to the box for faster speed
Purchased as a gift for a friend who has never owned a tablet of any kind. Great little tablet for a beginner, very good response time, for the money you really cant go wrong.
I have cut my cable. I would have done this before but didn't know how to get college sports. Fire with Amazon and SlingTV has bridged the gap. I receive local channels with an antennae and the fire does the rest. Saving about $75 per month.
If your looking for a simple tablet that does basic things? This is the one for you. I like it.
Fantastic deal for price. Does everything I need and then some.
It's amazing! I love how loud it plays the music!!
I love the load up speed there on great and a great way to enjoy netflix
Such a high DPI! looks like printed. the books are much cheaper
the tablet a 7inch starter tablet is very durable excellent tablet for kidsvery tough good processing speed.
The hardware is good, software isn't 100% operational all the time, i.e. PlayStation Vue has had issues quite often in the month I've had it, when it loads, it's great.
Honestly the worst tablet ever owned. Was very slow and unreliable would switch off
It is very easy to set up and easy to use. I love the slick looks.
My niece is using this for her college, great for kids use in college, very versatile.
She has no idea that this item has limitations and was thrilled to receive a tablet with a camera. She seems to be entrenched in it 24/7 so it must be working.
Got for my aunt for her first tablet. It has been user friendly for her, she yours it mostly for reading
There are plenty of Youtube videos showing how to install Kodi on Fire devices.
Love this product so much that I have purchased 3 now
Fast. Almost no buffering. Overall a great product. But only complaint is it's seriously slanted toward Amazon Prime. For instance, I have AMC through a cable subscription. Then why do I need to pay again for episodes on the Amazon AMC app? So stupid. With Roku, I don't need to pay anything extra for episodes I'm already entitled to.
This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead.
The only draw back to this device is no internet service included. My 1 year old granddaugther loves hers and I don't leave home without it.
I bought this to use only one application. Oh, is it most difficult to get this thing to continuously work! And I still can't get the geek squad program to properly download onto the device. I'm pretty disappointed.
This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!
Great product, I bought one last year and loved it. Had to buy another for the guest room. Having Alexa makes it even easier to use.
Very good quality product. I bout as a gift for a friend, she loved it
I install the echo in less than 15min and was using it and asking all kind of questions
Works as expected. Bought two as a gifts and both love them.
My son was excited to get this and it kept closing on him. Returned it but they don't have any in stock to exchange. Frustrated and my son is upset
My son trys to claim them all as his own . We own a Amazon Fire 7 tablet , Amazon 7 Kids Safe Fire Tablet and a amazon 8 HD tablet and he thinks all of them are his .
Set up was easy and I'm not really technological. The sound is fantastic and really fills the entire downstairs of my house. I love listening to music on it I love having random questions answered andI can't imagine not having my new roommate Alexa.
My wife gave this to me for Christmas. She try's to find some tech that I have never heard about. I'm not sure what happened or how I missed this coming out. This is by far my favorite gift in over 20 years of marriage. I was completely unaware of the Amazon Echo. I'm so glad she bought it for me. It's amazing all the things works with it. Thank you sweetheart for buying this for me!!
I like the size of the device as well as the expandable storage
Well my kids love them. So that's great for me. The only bad thing I can say is i can't figure out how to make it so they can download free games and not ones that cost money.
The fire tv has been very easy to setup and use. I haven't missed cable one bit.
I watch everything on this now From movies to Sports and ur everyday news
Don't over pay for things you don't need or want. Great value for a reader ! Just we were looking for and works good.
Good product to have for your family entertainment.
I recently cut the cord with cable and couldn't be happier. This fire TV box has made it so easy with so many ways to watch programming. I love it!
Is Great product. Easy to set up. Worked instantly.
This is a great little tablet. I haven't used my computer in weeks because the little tablet is so handy. Can't believe it took me so long to get one. Also bought my son and grandson one.
little hard to set up needed help to set up by son
Much faster then the tradional fire stick, I highly recommend it over the fire stick!
We had an older Kindle that needed to be upgraded. This is the same quality for less than half the price!! Love it and has a camera, our old one did not.
Its a great thing to get all the information I want really quickly and easy. I love my Alexa!!!!!!!
easy to setup, great for traveling and reading on the plane
It reboots sometimes but it beats paying cable bill
Great for kids. Lots of games and books for kids..
This is great, my daughters first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started. She loves the pink bumper guard and so do I for the safety.
Fast, supports ultra 4K, expandable memory, side load apps.What's not to love?
Our entire family is loving the Echo, easy to use, very smart, and sounds great..
I need more learning but I'm coming along.Sirii is better. Music is great on the echo.
I love these tablets I have two, I would definitely recommend they are light weight and hold a battery for a long time, great for emails , surfing the web or just shopping im gonna buy another for sure you should by this product
Inexpensive gift. Should have bought more to give away for Christmas
Very inexpensive and well made little tablet. Picked up two for the kids and they love them.
This tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. I bought the HD 6 when it came out for my daughter. I just had to replace it because it wasn't charging anymore, it wasn't the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.The best quality tablet i have ever seen. Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet.
I'm pleased with the potential this product has to make my everyday life easier.
I love this tablet because I could control my children his time with it it's working out really great
Bought it for my daughter and she can't put it down. Great for nextflix
Cancelled my dtv and this is everything 8 hoped for
like better than the 7 inch Kindle better to read.
Improvements over earlier 10" kindles. Only need a case or stand .
We have 2 Roku 3s, and we like the Fire TV better. It works so much better with our SlingBox...you don't have to go through your cellphone. Our Rokus freeze up frequently, but the Fire TV has only done this once. (So far!) We will probably buy a second one for our bedroom and move the Roku 3 to a guest bedroom.
It nice and simple clean looks nice.I'm really glad the bestbuy rep suggested
We bought two for grandkids and one for mother-in-law and both are happy with the product
Got for my 8 year old. The parental controls are nice. I wish the netflix app was registered as "video", so I could give him 30 minutes of games and 30 minutes of video. I'm sure this works with purchased videos, maybe prime, but not netflix. He Star Wars Commander, netflix, and reads books. It's a good size for little hands. It's great that as the parent, I can buy a book or game, and all devices can use it, even with each other if it's a multiplayer game. I bought a cheap case elsewhere that also props it up for hands-free video watching.
I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great.
Spots on both sides of the screen make it easy to move from page to page, both forwards and backwards. Light is great for both night and day reading.
Clear, easy to use, easy to read, This is my 2nd paperwhite & would buy again.
I'm still learning what all i can do with this device, but I am continually amazed at it's capabilities. I love playing with it and learning from it. When doing other things, I have Tap playing music. I love this thing.
I bought the Echo for my wife. She absolutely loves it! She mostly has it play music, but even the grandkids like to ask it questions like jokes.
I purchased this tablet for my daughter and ordered a protective case for it. She really enjoys amazon free time and I really like the way amazon software works.
I bought this as a requirement for my sons class. It was easy to set up, and he uses it with no problem at all. He just uses it for research in class, so I didn't want to spend a lot money-or give him my tablet, but I'm very pleased with all he's able to do on it. The price just seals the deal; I'm very pleased overall and would repurchase the tablet.
I have used the Fire TV for a day, and I think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality.
Since I got a 4k television I purchased this. Its a great little device. I still have an original 1080p version and this one is slightly faster. Great product.
This was purchased to replace a 1st generation Kindle. The Paperwhite is far superior to my old Kindle, display is easier to read in any lighting scenario and page turning is much better.
I was buying tablets for two grandkids ages 5 and 10. These did the trick and I didn't have to spend a fortune. I also bought the protective cases to protect them...Great purchase!
Goog!I would recommend this to a friend!!!I like it
Great its the box that will save me money. A must buy
I was NOT expecting this product to perform so well. Sleek design,compact, and easy installation make this product well worth the money. The only thing I was a little turned off by is that you cannot fully customize the wake name..yet..and you cannot connect it via Bluetooth to a soundbar/extra speaker. The overall performance of the sound that comes out of it is surprisingly great though. I just wanted more. I got over not being able to add more speakers pretty easily though. It's that good. I might suggest however adding a Harmony Home hub with it so you can REALLY take advantage of the voice features. It was my understanding that the echo can pair with the hub so you can control more items. I'm going to set that up today so it is NOT verified just yet.
I know it has Bluetooth but I think it should have had a auxiliary port for older speaker's
It is a very nice tablet, but the 10 inch tablet seems faster and easier to enjoy for the price
Nice size. Good tablet for the price. Bought three to have some spares. Only problem is having to get extra app to run You Tube properly.
Alexa is great for listening to music. Sound quality is excellent.
This is fun but would not buy again. Not very informative. Keeps say "I do not understand your question. "
Good product at low price... and very good image resolution
Works just as you'd expect. Small and compact which is nice, and charges the kindle really quickly (faster than it charges on my laptop). A little expensive for what it is, but glad I ordered this.
This is the 2nd fire tablet ive purchased. The first was for my daughter ans she
Black Friday sale $35! Can't beat a Kindle Fire for that price. Functionality resembles Apple products, but still isn't an iPad/iPhone. Great price for the product though! If you don't prefer Apple products, this is something to look at!
The Amazon free time is very kid friendly. My 2 year old uses it with ease. Tons of kid apps for all ages
I took my Kindle to the beach. You can read perfectly in the sunshine. I also like reading it while laying down because the page stays upright. it doesn't go horizontal when you move it
I wanted to buy the Echo for my husband and he loves it. We love to ask questions and play music. In the future, we want to connect our devices that are compatible with Alexa.
Great for streaming media slingbox Amazon prime Netflix Kodi great value
This Kindle is alot larger and better for viewing.
Bought this to read out by the pool. Works great! Only thing that could make it better would be if you could adjust text size for imported PDFs.
If you have Amazon Prime, this is an excellent way to view content in a small, quality device.
We bought this Amazon Tap Bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother. He loves it! He can play his fave tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening.
Bought this for my twelve year old grandson to replace his two year old Kindle Fire. He loved the blue color and said it was like his friends mini pad.
Easy set up. 4K ready. Great picture and WiFi connectivity
love the access to amazon and the ability to communicate with alexa
It really does almost anything i would recommend it to anybody
Everyone is able to use this. Even the 4 and 5 year old grand kids .
Hands free ask her anything and she'll answer and the speaker is loud
I bought this for my 8 year old. I was a great buy. The price was affordable compared to other tablets on the market and e 8" screen is perfect. Another great buy!!!
I gave this item to my wife and she loves it. She has used it to answer many questions and listen to music.
Echo is terrific! Can get quick weather reports, traffic reports, and answers to a lot of questions. Alexa even lightens up your day and mood with jokes!
I asked my Alexa to put on the music, what time and date and put my shopping list. Oh and how to spell thinks.
Excellent echo radio....good invented....nice product..
Being familiar with the Kindle tablets, I knew these would be a great gift for my nephews. The price was unbeatable for such a great product! Now that Christmas has passed and they have been given their tablets, they love everything about them. We are living in a digital age and these tablets will give them a great start managing their time and abilities to navigate through the operating systems for it.
I've used one before and loved the size, weight and feel.
Bought this for my mom. Surprisingly very capable and fast. Quad processor for the price? Unbelievable. User friendly.
Great size. Very portable. I like to carry this one in my bag. Holds alot of my favorite books. Easy to read.
Its a Kindle with Amazon and for only $40. Its a win regardless its for yourself or a gift for family.
excellent.they really enjoyed them. highly recommended.
Very powerful, tablet, can do so much with it, love it! Love the kindle, so many titles available.
This is a much improved Kindle reader than ones made 3 or 4 years ago. Much more user friendly
Did a lot of checking around and found this to be the best value.
Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age.
I purchased for my husband but Alexa is part of the family now. She can play anything off the internet and can interact with us if we have any questions but the best part is her "yo momma" jokes!
Fire TV helps me navigate several viewing sources which helped me end my relationship with my satellite provider. I'm now spending $35 per month & have access to sports, movies, etc.
I read many of the reviews about this tablet prior to purchasing it and was so glad that I did. It's a great tablet.Simple to use at a price that can't be beat. The item arrived in the promised timeframe and in good condition. Very happy with this purchase and will buy more for gift giving!
Good Product for the purchase, great for beginners.
I just cancelled cable it's very easy to set up and tons of options to watch. Ask Alexia anything you want any she has an answer.
Easy to set up. East tie you. Would highly recommend this product to others
Easy to operate for any age. I was amazed that even the four year old handled it like a pro.
This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.
Unit is nifty for some functions, it would be good with a prime membership. I expect a little more usable content without additional purchase for the price tag. Still have not fully explored the unit.
The kids love there new tablet and it got here so fast that I was shocked I only like shopping at Best Buys
Great purchase!!!! Allowed me to cut my cable off!
This was purchased to replace my 3rd gen Kindle Keyboard. The backlight is a great feature and even though I miss having page turn buttons, it was worth the cost savings to forego them.
At first I was a bit skeptical about the sensitivity of the touch screen on these new kindles, but it has been great. The reading is very smooth and I am quite please with this purchase.
I'd suggest 8-12 is a good age for this tablet, it's a great starter tablet until your young one shows responsibility, care and proper use of electronics.
This is so perfect for reading. If you only want it for reading, then I would most definitely get this. I can read for hours on it, in light and in the dark. It's super easy to buy books and download books. Favorite Christmas purchase!
Feels like you have your own concierge, butler, comedian and musician in the house. A lot of fun.
I have a 2nd generation Kindle and1st generation Kindle Fire. I hardly use those now. I also have an iPad mini, and an iPad Air. I like the Kindle Paperwhite because it's just for reading and so small, it hardly takes up any room in my purse. I enjoy reading novels on the Kindle PW especially with the backlight, more than I like reading on my iPad now.
I love this Echo, when I need to remember something I tell Echo to do it for me.
Good over all i had competitors sreaming devices and none were as good as this i would recommend to buy
I got this for my son because it's cheap enough for me to replace if he breaks it. I really have no complaints about it, has my music and great apps for my son to use. Not to mention it's easily replaceable. For more visit www.blackliontravel.com
The sound quality of the speaker in my opinion is not worth the extra cost versus a Echo Dot. I could spend the difference on a separate speaker to use with the Dot and also have the flexibility of using that speaker elsewhere.
Great little tablet would have got Five stars if you could use it with chromcast
I love it for my kids, they r enjoying playing games and watching kids cartoon.
I bought this on Black Friday for my 9 yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it
Really love everything this product can do. So easy to carry from one room to another.
I love the Amazon Fire Tablet. It was easy to use, easy to set up and is easy to see and use.
purchased as a gift for my mom and she loves it. great starter tablet.
THIS ITEM IS GREAT FOR A 15 YEAR OLD. IT IS JUST WHAT SHE NEEDED.
The best "personal home assistant" out there. Also the first, so it has a head start on Google's offering.
great price for a lot of fun. this is my 3rd amazon fire, great for games, movies. I installed kodi on it for extra programing and life tv. I loved my amazon fire TV.
Love my Kindle Paperwhite. I have always been a traditional book reader, but the Kindle is so easy to throw in my bag and go anywhere.
Very good product. So far working so good. Would recommend
I purchased this to give it a try, man it is great. It's a very reliable and responsive tablet. Connects to wifi very well and doesn't have buffering issues, as of yet anyway.I set up his and hers accounts but wish I would have bought two so when we both want to use it at the same time.
Good solid adaptor to fit the Kindle Paperwhite.
I love it you can ask it anything and it will answer you you can keep up with your football team he can play the music that you like and music you've never heard so you can figure out if you do like it I found out today if hummingbirds migrate you can ask it some very interesting questions.
We purchased our 2nd Amazon Echo for another part of the house because we like it so much. We can play all of our music and radio subscriptions. Plus there's a lot more.
Easy to set up and use. new skills being added all the time. we now have two echo and a dot in the house. makes playing music all over so easy and convenient.
I am glad I bought it. It is easy to use and have given me good book suggestions.
Have been doing exactly what it's intended to and only wish it more intuitive
I love it for reading but, it has issues when searching the Internet at times.
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! No problems reading on the beach.
Works well from outdoors, to plane to reading in bed. No issues. Excellent all around. Better than a light.
I've had every Kindle e-reader available. Though it doesn't have all the features available on the Voyage, the Paperwhite is the best. The issue I've had are the emergence of tiny light "leaks" emerging from the source through the matte textured page background. They're little pinhole-sized, bright light scattered across the page. It usually begins with just one, or two, and becomes several over time. It's distracting to reading. In a conventional book, it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page. If these little things don't bother you, then it's not an issue. The Paperwhite models don't seem to have this problem as often as the Voyage does. I went through 3 Voyage models before surrendering and returning to the Paperwhite. The Paperwhite has fewer total lights, so it's not as evenly lit as the Voyage, however, it's nothing significant.
It's so much better than her viewing on her tiny phone. Great price too.
Easy to use and can put parental blocks on it so that the kids don't get into what they shouldn't.
Most tv's come with all the viewing apps you need but they're not portable. FireTV has everything you want plus it fits neatly in your suitcase.
Person really likes the gift. Says it is ideal for his needs and then plus. Easy travel size as well.
It's good for reading books. It's great for playing games. Yeah.
This stuff just keeps getting better. Easy to set up and use.
My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games.
I have to say Alexa has been a great disappointment. Most of the time she doesn't know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesn't understand the question. I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say "Loop Mode" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right. There are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. We got it at a discounted price thankfully and I also got a Dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price. Dot is even worse at listening to commands than Echo is.
Good features, good cost. Recommend to anyone looking for tablet.
This tablet is technically my 3rd tablet. I always look for something cheap, and useful. I also am always looking for tablets that I know I can easily replace without cringing, if my son destroys them. This tablet has been the best so far. I love the limitation I can place for my son's usage, and the fact I can specify on what they can spend time on! Battery time is really good, I usually have to charge it every other day, even after heavy usage it does take a while before it needs to be charged. Wish there was more apps, and I have had issue with certain apps, but it may just be those developers issues and not the tablet itself.
The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. I love being able to watch my favorite shows and movies. I'm not a techy person but this was pretty easy to set and use. I like the taking remote. You can ask Alexa anything.
It's great but I miss the hd option. My 5yo loves it!
I love my Fire TV Box!! I use it almost everyday!!
Good tablet for browsing, watching videos and playing games.Totally worth the price.
Part of gift
Gotta say, I love this silly thing! Total light show, PLUS so much more!
This certainly isn't the most impressive device out there, but at $40 it is a fantastic value.
My 4 year old doesn't like the tablet for several reasons.. I can't say why, but she just doesn't like it. So, I'm going to have to get another tablet.
These are Christmas presents for my granddaughters. I am sure they will love them
Item worked fine
This was a gift for my son he enjoys it very much.
Alexa definitely makes life easier. The only downside is that she doesn't understand everything you say. I mostly use her for music, timers, and daily weather and news. The DOT doesn't have the sound quality of the full Echo, though
Great starter tablet, but let's face it... It's a Kindle at heart. Still, it's pretty awesome for a Kindle!!!
Easy to use, does great job of adjusting the background light for reading. Takes a little adjustment from my old keyboard kindle, but not a problem.
Bought this at Best Buy only because Amazon was out of stock. Does 4k video, tons of apps that support it. Just make sure that your cable company is on the list of providers for standalone apps, e.g. HBO Go, Discovery, History, Travel Channel etc, else you'll find yourself not able to watch their specific content on this box. Bought it mainly because I use Playstation Vue to stream content and hate the tile setup on Roku. PS Vue on the Fire TV is a timeline setup, I prefer this much more than the Roku setup. Great box, works flawlessly with Alexa and Prime memberships. IMO, worth the $90, plus I got a free 30 day trial of Sling. Although I think the Sling trial is a con more than a pro hahaha!
Great item, good service from Best Buy. It is uncanny that new and unique products are introduced often.
Bought this for reading on the Beach, works great. Plenty of books to choose from.
I love how it has a built in light and the fact that's it compact. Very easy to use.
It is as expected. For a tablet that cost $50.... Not bad
I wasn't sure about buying this product. Until I saw all of the amazing things it could do. A family member showed me and I was amazed.
I bought one and recommended this product also to my family and friends!
Very Good product. it works very well, have no troubles with it at all.
We bought this tablet right before a trip out-of-town, and it was a good purchase. Eight-year-olds crave entertainment, and the Amazon Fire gives plenty of that.It's been easy to handle, and hasn't had any issues breaking down.The charger cable is a pain to plug into the tablet (only the part that fits into the tablet itself), and some of the tablet versions of apps like Neko Atsume aren't good compared to the phone versions, but we are overall very happy with our purchase.
It's light and convenient to carry. I can, in fact, carry it in my jacket pocket. So it's good when I am moving around by bus. Book downloads are instant and don't take a long time; something I was concerned about. And the screen is truly comfortable, no strain whatsoever. The functions within the Kindle are also convenient enough to use. I bought it for $99 during Black Friday deals.
I was happy with the Echo but because I'm all Google I returned and went with the Google home. As far as the Echo the speaker was really good, picked up my voice from everywhere around my apartment (google home doesn't do as good as Alexa) Its a great toy for anyone
It's great for the kids, but not intuitive with using. Took a little bit to get used to it.
Amazon fire tv is great product. Wish the voice command option was more user friendly.
I love it. So easy to set up. Works with all my Amazon apps like Audible. Learning something new about it every day. Especially like using it for music. Totally happy with the item and purchase!
Very good speaker, echo is amazing, able to control Philips hue, and through Logitech remote, the tv as well.
This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!
I bought this item for a kid and she love it,, best of all the color make the product well like able, She claimed that it is fast and the parent is able to set up parental control.Parental control help parent to monitor activity easily
this product went well as a gift and was well excepted and used many times since purchase.
I love this Kindle. It syncs without needing to prompt for it, downloads new books quickly and the backlighting is effective even at low levels so I don't disturb my sleeping husband when I want to read in bed. Its compact and lightweight size make it easy to carry anywhere and comfortable to hold.
This kindle is totally worth buying. Does not have all the fancy bells and whistles that will almost never be used but has exactly what you need to just enjoy a good read.
Received the Alexa for my birthday and the whole family loves it. Going to purchase a few Dots for the kids so they stop taking my Alexa from the kitchen.
Decent little tablet at the price won't break the budget if broken.
The Amazon Fire TV is a great streaming box. I also have the Amazon Fire TV Stick which is just as good. The reason I gave the Fire TV only 4-stars is because I see no reason to even have the Fire TV as the Fire TV Stick is just as good if not better, considering its size, than the box. Sure with the box you get better performing specs out of it but what for? In my performance reviews, the Fire TV Stick performed on par with the Fire TV box. The choice is up to you as they are both great streaming devices. However, save yourself some money and go with the Fire TV Stick!
Bought these for my 3 college students. They love them
Love voice controlling my lites and small appliances, but there are some bugs to work out, sometimes have to ask twice, sometimes does not recognise them, but I am patient, uses Bing as a search, not impressed,
Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs
Good for kids ... brightness is not so good, .....
This was a perfect tablet for my 12 year old. It does everything that she needed it to.
I like this Fire very much. The background is bright so reading is easy. It would have been nice to have some instructions included.
Amazon Fire TV is a great system you able to watch videos on Netflix. Play video games also be able to do a lot of streaming very excellent system I will recommend this for other people to buy if they're wanting to gain more an lot of streaming.
It is highly recommended for someone who loves reading. Easy set up, lots of books to download.I have iPad, but this beats reading experience hands down.One downside is that the new Kindle Paperwhite has lower battery life compared to it's previous generation. Hence only 4 star.
Great price for tablet. Works great for my 3 year old that loves trains so can watch all the train videos on Amazon Prime and can limit the time with the FreeTime settings on the tablet.
If only the echo could sync up to a wireless Bluetooth speaker to extend it- it would be even better.
I bought this to replace my NOOK HD 7". Screen is way better than the NOOK HD.
I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me.
I received this tablet as a gift. I love it so much that I bought one for my husband.
I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
It is very fast and reliable, it is everything it says it is...
The best service ever and and knowledge of products
I bought two of these as a birthday gift for my niece and nephew. They absolutely love them. They use it all the time to play games and music. Great deal, great price LOVE ITL:)
Great product the entire family enjoys it. Works without any problems.
Bought this during the black Friday sale and really a nice tablet; the UI could be a little better but OK for a $ 35 device.
The Amazon Echo was recommended by our IT department at work and is easy to use. Alexa is smart and usually right. Highly recommended.
I haven't purchased a dedicated reader before, but bought this for a cruise where I knew it would be too sunny for an iPad, and this was easy to load up with books for my kids and I and it looked great in the bright sun while wearing sunglasses. Happy with the purchase.
Great tablet for the price. It is very clear to use and it responds well.
I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!
I'm a gadget guy and I've been watching this product for a while. I've read and read about the capabilities and finally decided to pull the trigger when I saw it on the shelf. It's been about 3 weeks now and I've learned a lot of the features. Alexa can tell you the forecast, your commute, and even some dad jokes. The sound quality is much better than most of my other Bluetooth speakers but she has to be plugged in all the time, no internal battery with this model. Right now it seems like more of a novelty in my kitchen but I plan on adding some home automation to get my money's worth. I don't think you'll be disappointed with the hardware or AI but it is difficult to add extra capabilities or "skills" through the necessary app because you have to scroll through all of them sequentially. The developers should add categories or a search function by capability. Last I checked there were 2 other models will the same AI capabilities and at lower price points. Read some more reviews and articles and find the one you can justify dropping $100+ on. You'll like it!
The lighting makes this kindle the best I 've seen.
Got it as a gift for a family member, and it works pretty good for the price you pay. Not a lot of tablets for $50 range. And it's pretty decent. Recommend to a friend who ended up buying for himself.
This is a big improvement over my old Kindle. The Paperwhite screen is perfect, and I'm loving reading on a Kindle more than ever. Read on!
Charger has worked well for charging my Voyage. Comes as a separate purchase from the Voyage which I found. Think it should be bundledwith the purchase price of the Kindle Voyage.
It has everything I need and the size makes it easy to read.
Bought one for my wife and I...I got the white one, she got the black one. Started reading through Stephen King's entire bibliography. Really loving it, and really loving the device. Great battery life and functionality. Highly recommended. If you are thinking about buying one, just do it. You won't regret it. And make sure to set up your local library digital account to rent books for free!
It was easy to set up. It is even easier to use. And I love all the free movies !!!!
it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointments.
Perfect for beginners or for anyone that wants great tablet at a great price although it's cheaper than when the original was released it still has the same greatness as it's predecessors for 1 forth of the price.
At first I didn't think this equipment was of much value when someone pointed it out to me. However after I got to thinking about it, I considered how much easier it would be to use as opposed to the keyboard. After using it, I've found that's not only is it much easier & faster, it's much more accurate as well.
The display is so much better than my previous Kindle Fire and have found more uses for it. It's nice to pull up my Comcast app and watch shows while working out on the treadmill. It was a pleasant surprise to find that Alexa was loaded as well!
Brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it!
This tablet is actually a surprisingly effective device, given its price point and performance, and definitely exceeded my expectations!
This tablet is awesome! I use this tablet to look at my emails, check facebook, browse the internet, playing games, shop a little and of course, read books. Does all this with ease, and I don't have any issues or problems. Lots of apps to load with ease. Great product!Overall, This Kindle fire works great and meets my needs. I could not be more happy with my purchase. Highly recommend!!!
I purchased the Fire TV box over the Fire Stick because the box supports 4K video. There isn't a lot out there yet, but I've been able to watch 4k programming from Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm using the Netflix, Hulu and FXNow apps -- Amazon Prime is built in. I also downloaded the free VLC app to stream video from my computer. I may end up getting a second one for another TV. Very happy with the Fire Box.
Amazon kindle fire tablet looks sleek just like a galaxy tablet. It functions well for its price.
I love my Echo! It just gets smarter and smarter! Wanting another one for upstairs.
Love the echo... amazing devise with all what u need in 1 product.Great buy
Absolutely can't get enough of my fire TV. Best purchase of 2017!! I highly recommend fire TV to anyone who doesn't want to pay a cable bill anymore. Hulu, Netflix, HBO is all u need and at about 1/10 the cost of cable, I love it!! Don't forget Kodi *wink*
Daughter love it can download all her app good battery
Tablet is good for it's cost. Works cool. Not used much so far.
I bought this for my Don's second birthday and he loves it. My five yr old loves it also. Very easy to use.
Size makes tablet easy to take with but still large enough to be easy to see.
I didn't realize that you can't even put Youtube or similar apps on here. Ugh. Had to return product and get a different one.
great product, we are loving it, highly recommended
This tablet has so many apps with games, movies, and books that it keeps my nephew entertained for hours on end.
This is a great little system for listening to music and simple commands
Very functional for my needs. Quick and easy to set up. I love my new Kindle Fire!!!
I love the new Eco. It is especially fun to listen to all the great music.
This is my second Kindle Fire, and this is a great improvement from my 1st generation version. With micro sd capabilities, I can download and store so much more. Paired with Amazon Prime and I'm never bored!
We love Alexa she is fun and informative. I would get this as a gift for a friend.
I believe it could be a little faster. Screen isn't very tough, broke in a few months.
Tablet easy to use and is great for face book, internet, watching movies, and reading. price was great.
I love this tablet. It is a perfect size, works great and was very affordable.
Not much negative to say other than I don't like how you buy an Amazon card to put on the tablet and yet they still require a credit card.
Bought for my daughter , so far she is very pleased
I am really enjoying my Amazon Echo!! It was very easy to set up and very easy to use (you just have to remember to say Alexa first). Showed it to my sister-in-law while she was visiting and now she wants to order one.
I purchased this tablet for my five year old and he loves IT and so do I. The games and activities are age appropriate. This tablet is such a great buy.
This product is so fancy, neat, and fun to use! HOw could you not pass this up to purchase!
Great little tablet. Exactly what we needed for our daughter. It works great around the house and she can play games while we roadtrip. Perfect for our needs.
My son is very happy for this tablet that I gave him for Christmas
The sales person was very helpful and informative.
Purchased for my grand child. They love it. They play and add gamehis.
Long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. Alexa.
Overall this device is great. No problem with performance and usage. My only fault I think they can advance on is the remote. the current one is nice and sleek but lack the ability to type. Hitting the arrow keys to search for anything is a pin. Second I would add the ability to search for Apps a little more easily. Finally the web browsing is not the best and definitely needs advanced on.
Lightweight, fits perfectly in my hands, good screen quality. Makes reading even more enjoyable.
I have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and HD, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her.
No problems, enjoy being able to watch movies without paying additional fees to rent. Netflix & hulu accounts are available
I love my kindle fire but wanted this for reading outside and on the beach. It is perfect!
We upgraded to the 4K version. It has better buffering, and we love the voice search capabilities on the remote. It is super simple to set up and start watching your favorite programs. It also let's you add external apps like Kodi. Well worth the money.
This tablet has been so good that I bought 4 so far.All my nephews and nieces have one and they are loving it.
The screen is clear and battry last for 8hr. The camera is easy to use and can been taken for good pictures.
I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
Got this for my mother in law and she loves it. It's easy on your eyes and it is very user friendly.
My son was very pleased with this kindle and will read more often now.
The processor is very slow. The tablet is great for reading books and ordering stuff from Amazon, but it is really slow opening aps. Pay more to get the better processor.
was looking at a tablet on sale. saw the kindle-old one quit (on off switch), this one even had a camera. love the whole thing.
I love this thing. I am a bit of a bibliophile and obsolutely love books. This isn't to replace books, but it makes stories more accessible. It's easy to use. Has great better life. It's perfect.
Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!
Great for outside reading. My iPad has been good too with the kindle app but can't see well in bright light. This fixes that.
First time user and very pleased. Great for me because of my book downloads. Not too big and not too small.
Got an unbelievable deal!! The best part is having a library of books at my fingertips!! Easy and simple to set up and great when I'm traveling!!
is simple and easy to use, also is perfect size for my purse or a carry on bag
This product lives up to all of its hype my 4 year old grandson can use this with ease
I purchased this for my fianc. She reads books with it,surfs the web, and watches Netflix on it. Very easy set up and easy to use. It also comes in different colors.
He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint.
Love my Echo, cant wait to learn how many things she does! LOTS OF FUN
I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO YOU. This product is really light and portable. You can carry it to caf or library for reading. There is no harm to your eyes because of it specific technology. The only drawback is that it will flash when you turn the page. But this is the common problem for this kind of reading stuff. I think it is acceptable. I bought on the price of 99 with a 25 discount. So it really worth it.
The newest Kindle eReader (Voyage) is a very good upgrade over the current model. It has several new hardware & coming software enhancements over the current model. However, unless you do an extreme amount of reading, I would not recommend upgrading if you owned the current PaperWhite generation. The high price does not justify it.
It's a tablet, there's not much more to it than that. Simple interface, and easy to use.
It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
I purchased the Amazon Fire TV because it gives you the ability to use streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and many other android based programs. The Amazon OS and GUI is excellent. Smooth and not complicated. The ability to use the microphone on the remote is perfect for anyone as it is very accurate and easy to use. The video streaming is very good, the processors and RAM can give you smooth playback with any media file you can play on it. I highly recommend this box for anyone looking for a streaming device at a great price.
Love that we can have access to so many movies and tv shows!
Love it, especially the ability to stream Prime Music.
There are some things I can't download. But, good.
The tablet is a good tool to help him with reading
I like buying things that work as advertised. This does.Although it does not respond as well to my wife's commands. Hmmm...
the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. It works well as promised.
I am enjoying my Amazon seven inch tablet. It is fast paced with good graphics and long battery life. The main problem is that the volume is lower than other tablets. Still,great deal for the price.
This is a great device to have if you dont have cable at home and you need to add a program call Kodi also.
Small lightweight reader, the paper white really does work, in any conditions
I bought this product to replace my nvidia sheild. I'm glad that I did. I have noticed that while streaming video that buffering is almost non existent. In my opinion, this is the best platform available for running the Kodi app.
I am amazed at this little tablet! I had, and still have, a Kindle Paper White for 3 years before I dared to try to use it, and after using it I was intrigued by the possibilities.... I joined a public library and began reading books for free. When I had trouble downloading some books because they were EPUB instead of KINDLE, I decided to look into the FIRE. This FIRE cost me $39! Amazing. I don't use a SMART PHONE and normally only find myself online at home or someplace where I drag my laptop like a hotel or at Starbucks. This little number allows me a lot of flexibility. Besides downloading books, I can go online, I can download music from my AMAZON PRIME account for free (music that I don't want to pay for to get onto my IPOD CLASSIC). I can hook up the FIRE to my BOSE speakers and the sound is great! I already watched a PBS TV show on the FIRE while waiting to get an oil-change done on my car at the dealership. I added 64 gigs of memory for about $20, thinking that I might build quite a music library on this little machine. Since the memory is removable, if the tablet gets deep-sixed, no problem transferring the music elsewhere, I think! I have almost figured out how to get the music from the FIRE onto my MAC...but maybe it can't be done ... I don't know. AMAZON doesn't let you download from the PRIME music library to a computer...they only allow the download to tablets and phones. But there must be a way around this...I think it's been fun trying to figure it all out. On the downside, I hate the fact that the screen is not an anti-glare screen to begin with, but I bought something which I think will solve that problem. Don't like the fingerprints ... I'm trying to get used to the notion of a touch-screen. I'm OLD...I don't like change...so adapting is not that easy. But I'm working on it and I would say for the money, even adding the cost of the accessories I purchased, that this was a worthwhile meander into the realm of mobile connectivity. I'm having a lot of fun with it! The tablet DOES subject one to advertising when you open it...but I ignore it. I ignore all advertising everywhere so it's not hard for me to do...it's a well-ingrained habit. If I were forced to look at and read the advertising however, then I would consider a more expensive tablet that is free of advertising. But for the money you have to make allowances for commerce, I guess. I'm an APPLE person so I felt this would be very hard to figure out, but it's pretty intuitive after about 4 hours of making endless mistakes! LOL. I SAID I was old...don't expect to know what you are doing right away if you are essentially a technological idiot. Thing is you CAN figure it out. I don't read instructions so maybe if someone were more willing to have things explained to them it would be a shorter learning curve. But I only learn by trial and error. Have fun! Buy the thing...it's so cheap that if you hate it it's no big loss! The screen adjustments for reading are good...font size, background color, etc. I needed to have something that was easy on the eyes...this works for me!
Purchased two for my twin girls and they love. Simple, they can download apps and watch videos. Only thing the chargers are working not only after a week.
The screen is big and the Kindle is easy to navigate. Having Amazon prime definitely makes it worth the investment
The size is nice for portability, roughly the size of a normal paperback, nice features, very easy to use, adding books to it is a very easy procedure, either downloading or hooking it up to the computer to transfer .pdfs, etc.
I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already.
For the price it's perfect. Does all the basics well and if you break it you won't be heartbroken. Well worth it.
Was in special,, easy to get it online and pick up in the store,, nice service and the personal very gentle
Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is.
Works well.great for playing games and daily information
This has been one of the most valuable accessories I have purchased from Best Buy in a long time. I do encourage everyone to find a use for it
I strongly recommend this item a lot of things to do
A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.
I bought two of these for my kids, They've destroyed ipads and this was a low cost replacement. Great price still not an ipad substitute
I love my old kindle, but after a few years and drops the power button doesn't like to work a lot of the time. So took advantage Black Friday deal to replace the one that is going out.
Ok device for the asking price. Would give as first time user
Great item to have in your home. Works exactly as advertised. Hopefully it won't become outdated
She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her
much better than the stick...do not i repeat do not waste your time or money on the stick...go directly to the fire tv
Bought this for our 8 year old boy. Nice to have a micro sd slot. The processor seams a little slow. But seems to work sufficient enough for him. Great parental controls.
I had been doing research on wether to get an echo for a long time already had to take advantage of the sale.
This media streamer is good. I like the voice feature.
Use it everyday...sign up for amazon prime and watch almost anything..
This is the fourth one I have bought. I love them. So easy to read books or go online.
Love that tablets bought the tablets for friend that love it
I have a three year old one and this makes it work like a dinosaur. So many improvements.
At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it..
Tablet is for my 2 year old son and it has great learning game so for him! He's learning to read and so much more!
Easy to set up. So far I like it. I added CBS All Acess to it and work great.
I picked up this tablet, stacking some discounts and codes while on sale for $33 delivered.
We decided to cut our cable bill and start using streaming devices instead. The Fire has been great. The only problem is finding time to watch all the stuff we put in our watch list.
So far I've had my Fire Tablet for over a month. Its my first tablet. The lack of the Googlke Play store means the Amazon apps are pretty limited, but I found avway around that. The front camera is grainy but acceptance while using Skype. Battery doesn't last long, and it seems to take hours to recharge. For a $50 first tablet, I suppose those are acceptable flaws. Feels robust in the hand, though the plastic casing reminds you of its materials if you hold it tight.
It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.
This was bought primarily for photos. I added the 128 card. Putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. My wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. I'd recommend making a Geek Squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. That way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. Also I got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. That made it $100 less and hence the "great deal" in the title. It may pay to ask about a return. I plan to take some of the free classes offered.
Gave these as gifts for Christmas and everyone loved them! The are small and full of fun
I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!
I have an Echo or an Echo Dot in almost every room in my house! The Echo has incredible sound for such a small device. The Echo Dot is not that hot as a speaker, but both of them work great for controlling your other smart home devices. I personally have it set up to control my Hue lights, my Schlage Connect lock (with a Wink Hub), and my Logitech Harmony Hub to control my entertainment system! Fantastic buy!
I bought the Amazon Kindle so I could enjoy reading without lugging around multiple books. I usually read my ebooks on the Kindle app but I have gotten frustrated with my phone/tablet going into sleep mode. This Kindle is sufficient for my needs. I purchased a reading light for when I'm in low-light situations and it works very well. I am satisfied with my purchase.
At first, the fire box was great. After two months the remote stopped working. I'd say save some money and just get the fire sticks. I have two of them and no problem. The fire tv box has been nothing but issues.
I bought this tablet for my 8 year old....when going on long cars rides it's nice to keep them entertained. It was a great value.
Echo is a great first step into using smart things. Linking it with your amazon account allows you to stream music from amazon prime or your amazon cloud. you can add items to shopping lists, ask questions, etc. You can then start adding smart devices in the home to control. The possibilities continue to grow.
This is my husbands tablet. It is just for general use, but he thinks it's great.
i bought this for my mother in law and she cant put it down she loves it
Got a great deal. I don't think I'd spend more than $100 on it. Works well with xm though.
We bought this to have all of our streaming services in one place. It does exactly that. Awesome for logging in and taking it with you.
For the longest time, I was using my phone to store a few books to read when I have the time. But it came to the point that my battery was suffering from this. What I love about the Paperwhite is the battery life, about 8 weeks. In addition to that, you can turn down the brightness to the point that it looks like an actual page, so its actually better for your eyes. I have about 300 books on my paperwhite so I am beyond satisfied. Definitely worth the $.
Great kindle for everyone who loves to read highly recommend and what i like is you can enlarge print to fit your needs.
Bought this after reading and watching a number of reviews. It was a mother's day gift for my wife. She loves it. She gets to tell it what to do - and it listens. Highly Recommended.
The Amazon voyage really is a fantastic ereader. Prior to owning this tablet, I had a couple of PW2's which are great tablets in their own right. My wife knew that I had my eye on the Kindle Voyage but I was waiting to catch it during one of Amazon's rare sales events. Unfortunately my wife ended up buying it for me for Father's Day and I planned to take it back and wait for a sale but after comparing it to my PW2 side by side, I decided I couldn't wait for it to get cheaper and so I kept it. The PW2 is a great ereader (ended up giving it to my oldest son) but the Voyage is more crisp and the backlighting is quite a bit whiter. It's also a couple of ounces lighter and slimmer. Is it worth the upgrade? Definitely, if you can get it on sale (usually $150). At $199? Well, that's up to you. Obviously I paid full freight and I don't regret it.....much. :) With that being said, the PW3 is worth a look too. Same 300 ppi clarity but usually $80 to $100 cheaper. The Voyage has a bezel that's flush with it's glass so it's not the "crumb catcher" paperwhite is but hey, maybe you want to skip eating while you're reading and save the dough!
The tap has pretty good sound for a speaker this size. I also have an Amazon Dot, but would recommend you pay the extra cost and get the Tap to enjoy the better sound. It's worth it.
I just needed something with a front facing camera to allow my grandmother to skype with my son. On sale for $40, a tablet that does that and allows you to stream videos...steal. Technology is a trip.
Finally stepped up to the plate and got into the Amazon Echo bandwagon; let me tell you, I don't know why I waited. Easy to connect, easy to teach it new skills, don't have to yell or talk like a robot myself to get it to work. My house is on it's way to the future!
even my luddite spouse loves it. Easy to use. Read in full sunlight.
My son uses it in his therapy to track his program. It is the perfect size.
We got a great holiday deal on this tablet. The set up was easy and it made a great gift.
Great phone for any level of android user, starting from a beginner to an advanced root user, camera can be better though
Worked great ..... it entertained my 2 year old just great.
Purchased this to mainly read books after my Nook died. Can't beat the price, but the print quality isn't as good as some other tablets. It's more like black on grey as oppose to crisp white. It can be a little difficult to read from versus the higher price tablets.
Device makes an excellent personal internet access machine! Some apps don't load on the device, but those are few and far between. Great music player as well as good interface with online streaming services such as Netflix. No need for a DVD player for the kids with this!
Having had a Roku as well the interface for the Fire TV far exceeds that of the Roku .
Got this for my dad as a gift. He loved it! Great alternative to an iPad
Kids love it I don't get to use it they take it over , really want the other things to come with it but to expensive they should have bundles for them .
Is exactly what I was hoping for. Easy to use. Absolutely perfect product.
Got them as Thanksgiving and Christmas gifts during the Black Friday. Works perfectly as an e-reader or as a basic tablet for watching youtube or reading anything online. You get what you pay for so don't compare this with Apple or Samsung. Happy with the purchase.
Didn't already said great! Minimum fifty characters?
Easy setup, great sound, stylish, and fun to use!I'd love one for every room in my home!
Great sound. Great for playing music, or controlling your home. With some exceptions. Don't expect Alexa to answer any questions you have though. "sorry, I don't know the answer" is a common response. Obviously google home is going to have great access to google but can't Alexa at least TRY?
This is great for a first time tablet owner lots of features
Excellent device. Great for reading on the go.reading settings for more than one reader.
Love Fire TV. I have since cut cable, with the exception of my internet connection, and have no regrets. I get more channels through streaming media apps. and at cheaper prices. The menu is also user friendly. The remote is excellent, as is the voice commands options. You won't regret purchasing Fire TV.
This has been very best Android box I ever purchased. There is so much to watch and very easy to use.
Installed easily. No issues so far. Using it for netflix, amazon prime, and playstation vue.
Gift for spouse, easily downloaded books. Uses while waiting for kids to finish school activities. Definitely recommend.
One of my many Christmas gifts and it was successful
I purchased this for my mom as a substitute for her kindle fire when she goes to the beach. She loves it and no glare when using! Great if you like traditional looking books.
it can answer very easy questions, but anything more advanced it does not understand. You have to be very specific, for example you can ask whats in a martini, but you cant ask how do I make a martini. Its got room for improvement.
I needed something that will easily connect to hotel WIFI cause I travel a lot so researched all devices and saw that the Amazon Fire was meant to connect to hotel WIFI with ease and I must that this device lives up to what it says it hooks up with to the hotel wifi with no problems great picture and fast steaming and I now use this at home as well I love it.
I bought this for my husband mainly for surfing the internet. Seems to do this fairly quickly. He likes it.
This is my first kindle and I love it. Would highly recommend
If you are all in on Amazon, this is the tablet for you. If you don't care about all the bells and whistles, and don't need the latest and greatest tech its a great tablet. We purchased one for my dad (60+) and he enjoys it for his web surfing and facebooking. The screen could be bigger, but for the $30 bucks we paid for it, its hard to complain.
big screen,2 year old granddaughter watches Sesame Street and scrolls through selections....
Picture quality is great and wide variety of features
Let's be perfectly clear, this is not an IPAD. But for $50.00 this 7" Fire is a steal. I'm very happy with this purchase.
We purchased this for our son (9) and it works great for him.
I was looking to purchase the Fire TV stick or the Fire TV. I got the FIre TV on Black Friday. My friend purchased the Fire TV stick and I was impressed with the capabilities it provided. When I saw the Fire TV on sale, I decided to give it a try and I was really impressed with the speed with just going through the menu and the apps. I would definitely recommend this product who is looking for a media player. There is a lot of app options to get.
Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.
Great device. Bought 3 of them for grandkids.. 7 of them have them.
It wouldn't connect to internet. Tried at home, at a couple of Wi-Fi spots and at the store where I bought it.
Works great, nice picture, pretty fast; only downfall is that you can't access the Google Play Store, which I needed due to some specific apps. That's the only reason for 4, not 5 stars. I will still keep it though. Great for the price
Great kindle if you don't want to spend your money for the wifi .
I was in need of a new small speaker for music in the kitchen. The Echo has been a surprisingly awesome addition to my home. You know that best friend in college you listened to music with who had the most extensive selection of bootleg cassette tapes you had ever seen? With my prime account through Amazon, I have spent countless hours playing music long forgotten. "Amazon, play {insert artist here}..." and I am reconnected to old music and exposed to new. I love asking Amazon about the weather while making my coffee. The sound quality is fantastic. There is so much that the Echo can do that I have yet to explore. I started using the grocery list this morning and feel like there is more and more to get out of my Echo. I will be buying an Echo for my folks soon- and my teenagers love it. 5 stars!
Echo simply did not do anything it was advertised to do. Basic weather was sporadic and more detailed questions resulted in "Cannot find response".
Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage.  Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.
It is like having a stereo with every song. We have just started to use this incredible device
I really enjoy my echo. I also bought a battery for it so I can take it places
This is s great product. We plan on expanding the smart home aspect.
I have owned several Kindles over the years, and this one is the best yet. The contrast and clarity is improved over the already-good Paperwhite 2. I like the page turn "buttons" on the bezel as well.
I like the covered protection it has and also it comes with 2 years replacement so no need to worry. It has fire os so apps won't be much but there are enough apps for kids .
Gave the family the Echo for Christmas and we are still learning how it can be used. So far it is a hands free Siri, not a bad thing, that can be used by the whole family. It is an easy and fun way for us to learn about the IOT.
Better quality then most tablets in same price range. I still suggests the accident protection plan or at least a okay case for it. Ads on lock screen is a bit of a let down but it functions like its supposed to.
I wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies (Netflix, Prime), that could check e-mails, that could Skype, etc. all while remaining affordable (under $100). I have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. This tablet has handled whatever I throw at it, and with no hiccups. I had the cheaper $50 Fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. If you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up.
Great way to read books. The screen is readable in any light. Add a waterproof case and you have the perfect beach or pol side library!
This Fire TV works great for playing some games and streaming content. It's a plus that it's 4K enabled. Haven't really been able to use the 4K so can't comment on that
Bought this for my elderly aunt. Was able to customize it so that it would be very simple to use for games. Amazon customer service is amazing.
Really loving the Fitbit Blaze so far. It reminds me to keep pushing and motivates me to stay active. The features are awesome and battery life is amazing. I definitely recommend this watch to someone looking to start being active/continue to be active/or push their limits. Great investment. FYI (it's a fitness watch not a true smartwatch)
This was on offer for thanksgiving. I just bought it just as a second tablet to iPad. have to say it is good. .
I'm super impressed with Alexa and how easy it was. Literally out of the box and connect to wifi and done.
Nice amazon fire tv ... Super quad core processor good box to see apps
This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. It is easy to use and keeps him occupied for hours.
If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem.
If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint.
My Amazon Echo did not power back on after we had a loss of power, even though we had it plugged into a surge protector. I am almost a full year out of warranty for my echo and Amazon sent me this power plug for free and almost like magic my Echo came back to life as soon as it was plugged in with this new power adapter. Yay, we have Alexa back in our lives! Hooray!
Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!!
Haven't had that much experience with it yet but from what I've done so far, it's been great fun. Love that it can be linked to my home security system. Also, so grateful Geek Squad offers a free class on how to use it. I plan on signing up for that soon!
Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome!
Just make sure you have good internet speed and you will be all set.
The Amazon echo is worth it just for playing music. You can play pandora or Amazon prime music. But it's much more from setting a timer to adding items to my shopping list. Alexa answers your questions better than any device. And totally hands free
We are enjoying Alexa a lot! she is funny at times
Like the music at your command. We keep in the kitchen. Everyone in the family can add to grocery list. That Alexa app on our phone reminds us what to pick up at store.
The tablets and the cases are perfect for my grandkids.
Got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. Uses it for game play, homework, etc. Mom and Dad loves the parental controls. Not having to worry so much.
Did not go shopping for this item specifically, but the salesperson saw us looking at it and gave us lots of information and we bought it. Pretty cool, we are still getting used to it and love being able to play music via voice commands.
Enjoy Kindle but have to tap screen several times before it goes to next screen when I'm in e-mail
Love this lightweight easy to read Kindle. Carry it with me all the time especially to the beach and pool. So easy to see! My sister bought one the same week I did, she liked it so much.
Love it! So much better than the model I had previously.
I love the fire tvits great to stream netflix....amazon, it also lets u download games
I got this during black Friday for a great price. I know this is essentially their older tablet but it still has a decent processor and has a micro SD slot for cheap expandable storage.In short it runs great and I set up a child's profile for my son so he can play the apps we added for him and don't have to worry about him running up charges etc because of the child profile.
I got two Fires for the kids to tool around on while they're learning how to use a tablet and they are great. They're fast, HD, and have expandable storage.
I bought it for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it. Her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too.
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
I bought this item for my kid for 35$ and enjoying lot. Compared to other Tabs this is a great bargain.Pros: Its easy to use , battery is excellent works for long, even while games are being played.Strong body and very good touch sensitive.Cons: Screen resolution looks little grayish , not bright enough. which probably is good for kid eyes while playing longer.
This Kindle fire is amazing. I love how kindlely and fiery it is.
I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!
I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show
Great for the kids, picture quality is great and it is durable.
Amazon echo is an amazing product. I researched and read reviews and they seemed too good to be true. I purchased the Echo from Best Buy for my husband's birthday. It was very easy to set up. ALexa is very charming. This is like having a computer that answers all your questions, plays music, and creates lists. This is truly a wonderful voice recognition device.The sound as a music speaker is great. It's a hit with the whole family.
Very convenient! It fits in my purse or jacket pocket, which is a plus, and it has most of the same apps that are available for my mobile phone. I am enjoying my new device.
New kindle is so much better than paperwhite. Kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite - not a problem with the voyage.
Fire tv is to Android users as to Apple TV to Apple users. It's fast and never has any issues streaming
Bought it for my wife and I haven't heard any complaints, so I think it's great. If she's happy I'm happy
As an existing Amazon Prime member, this is a no brainer. Has all the parental controls and kids can have a decent tablet that is durable for use, at a good price.
This purchase was totally worth every penny I paid for it, which wasn't even so much.
The Fire Stick runs nicely on the bedroom TV, and I have the Fire Box setup on the main TV.
My 8 year old loves the tablet. It is easy for her to navigate. She has been downloading apps with ease. Which are age appropriate. She loves the magenta color. Best of all was the price. Very affordable.
Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.
I bought this for my son, He really loves it for reading and playing Games.
Bought it for the bedroom. Now I have to buy another for the family room.
Purchased as a gift for my 83 year old mother. It proved to be simple to use. She is very comfortable using the device and the option for large screen print has given her back the joy of reading.
I like how it runs Android, so I can sideload any app for Android on the Amazon fire TV. I just wish it supports NTFS file system and have a volume control and power for the actual TV (like a universal remote)
This will be the perfect Christmas gift for my grandson who loves to use his little sisters tablet. Easy to use and very reasonable price.
For the price the tablet works well. The biggest issue I've had is the battery life length. The battery seems to not last as long as my previous iPad mini.
I purchased 2 Fire tablets for my foster children, and I must say , I love them! The Fire give parents so much control over what the kids can do it. The best feature is the curfew it has on it. You can set it for a time to come on and off, and more than anything, you can set it so, they will have to spend a certain amount of time on educational activity before it allows them to start watching videos or playing games, etc. I love it!
I bought this for my granddaughter so she could have it to watch movies and play games. She loves it and takes it everywhere she goes. It is way better than a leap pad and it can grow with her.
This is much better than the echo. The sound is great
My son has a 1st gen iPad and some of the newer games won't work for that operating system. I wanted a decent tablet that could play those games without locking up and not be as expensive. Amazon came through with this great product to meet my needs.
Easy, fast and efficient.great lil tablet in this price range for anyone.
This kindle is great, perfect size. Easy to navigate. I even purchased two more for family
Good for the price, but that's not it! The interface is clean as ipad and but there is limitation in app stores. Initially I tried to use this Fire tablet to cast videos to my TV which has the Chromecast embedded. I have not figured out how I can do it. Beautiful display, easy transition from my paperwhite, connected easily to my wifi. I haven't done much yet except read books. It looks so pretty! TANGERINE is so pretty! Good Price as well!
Great product .I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.
Alexa enable Amazon eco is awesome voice command device and great sound quality
I love the ability of my fire to hold ebooks or audio books as well as being able to go online, check email, take and post pictures and updates. I can even play a game while listening to an audio book.
Great voice recognition - super easy to set up - the closest you'll get to the computer on the Enterprise!
Well worth the money. I found the Fire tv great and I really am satisfied I recommend it to all my friends and family
I love my Amazon echo. Amazon is always updating the software so Alexa is always learning new things that can be useful on a daily basis.
I had an older version of the kindle and was starting to have issues with it so decided to look into a new one. The week I decided it was time to look at purchasing a new one it was on sale! That was an added bonus. This is a great improvement over the one I had and it cost considerably less. It's much faster and has a camera.
The kindle fire is great especially the kid version. The free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.
my husband wanted this item. from what I later found out, you have to also buy different componets to do certain things. didn't expect that.
I bought 2 of these, played with one of them, then gave then as gifts to people for Christmas.
Just ask or command the machine does it...getting really lazy now LOL
Great tablet, apps are in Amazon's app store, works great !when I initially downloaded software, I received a virus which I, managedto load my antivirus, but just barely since using the keypad was difficultwith the virus (iiicandy virus), but running the software A/V I managed to remove it... Have Kaspersky A/V for android...
The processor and speed of this unit is unparalleled. As long as you have fast enough wifi (and a docsis modem) you will only get signal loss once in a great while; and it won't be the FireTv's fault. Love the plethora of apps available for various channels and the use of SlingTv with this box is a great option in place of cable/satellite.
Wanted a tablet that was cheap in price but good in quality. This is it. Plays the games they enjoy, e books, you name it. Parents controls are great. You can limit the time they have on different fields. Has help my kids with time management. They know a few minutes here and there can add up quick, or let them play later.
I have two fire tablet in different colors. I love to read because the books are so clear. Many books are available to read for free. I like to purchase both free and paid books. As much as I read it may be cheaper to just go kindle limited so I can read any book.
I need to set up the app so I can have more options
should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse
Good streaming box for 4K with Netflix and Amazon prime. Has issue with sound not balanced or randomly lowering or going really loud.
Great choice, battery life outstanding, many kid friendly features.
I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon. Excellent value.
Great device. Makes things so easy when you can just tell out what you want to hear, or ask our questions...especially while cooking, our if your hands are full. Have integrated out with the Philips hue bulbs and love it.
Replaced first generation Kindle, love improvements!
My kids love this tablet. There are over hundreds of games, books, and shows to pick from
From what I am told, it is excellent! Was a gift...
The Amazon Echo is a great way to be entertained and stay well informed! Thanks to technology you can ask Alexa, questions and because it's a blue tooth speaker you can play your music in a stylish way!
I like the new kindle I purchased. I like the home screen better than older versions.
Great tablet. My kids love it. Great for the prices.
It is fast and affordable streaming player. All app are supported.
Love this tablet. Great for social games and videos. Cant beat the price
Great for my kids. Syncs to all of our Amazon videos and netflix. The protective kids case is a must. Makes it easier for smaller kids to hold without touching the screen. Also does well with drops to the ground
Alexa was easy to setup and begin using. It can answer just about any question you need an answer to. Loads of fun to use!
Easy to use, fast response.The display with light is a big plus.
Nice, sleek design, works well, at least so far:)!
There is so much to do with the Echo, that I am still getting to know it. Everyday, I learn and try a new skill. Great device, great price!
I've tried Apple TV, chromecast, original fire stick and I love this one the best. Easy to use and setup, voice search is nice. Much better if you have add on products like Netflix Hulu or kodi. Only beef is the poor content selection from Amazon.
Got these for the neices and nephews they love them.
The Paperwhite itself is a very nice design and the size makes it portable and easy to hold. The fact that you will be purchasing books from Amazon makes it all the better. Many, many discounted books for 99 cents to 5 dollars. Well worth the price of the reader. Was just on the beach in direct sunlight and no problems whatsoever.
not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done
The Echo is fun, functional and entertaining. The commands are appropriately responded to approximately 80% of the time. The ability to simply orally request songs by a specific artist or a specific song is amazing. The music catalogue is extremely large and wide ranging. News, weather and straight forward informational requests are almost always answered correctly and clearly. The technological applications are varied and growing. They don't interest me--yet. The music alone makes this device a marvel and a bargain.
I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this but I use it daily. really like the shopping list option, really helps
I really enjoy my Fire Tablet! I am able to read, watch videos, tv shows and much more! It is awesome for my little ones but it do not have youtube kids. Instead, you can pull up youtube kids on the regular part of the table, using the internet. That became a plus with my kids. I like how you can customize it to fit your child age!
This is my second Amazon Fire TV. I like both first and second versions of the AFTV, unless your programming is broadcast in 4K, you won't notice the picture quality of the two versions. It has all the Apps you will need and available to sideload if it's not available thru Amazon. Voice command only works with downloaded Apps. Overall, I like AFTV over 3rd Gen Apple TV....
This is awesome. The updated features work well. Really fast an smooth. The light dimming is great the best feature on the new kindle.
This works great for my Kindle
I bought this to replace my Fire TV Stick because the wifi in my house is terrible. I wanted something that I could plug an ethernet cable into and I am NOT disappointed! The speed on this device is incredible! Very fast interface and I get much less buffering now that it is plugged directly into my cable modem. I did have to upgrade my router and change out my CAT5 for CAT6 cables, but that is more likely due to the speed going to the Fire TV and not the product itself.
Works great we are Amazon prime so love the shows ! I am using this with wireless .
Best tablet and most affortable. Love that it just works. Must have Prime.
For those on a budget, this tablet gets the job done. No buyer's remorse.
I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied.
Better than I thought easy to set up small enough where it dosent take up much room and sound is good
The Amazon Fire tv is awesome. Anything and everything you could imagine at your fingertips to watch. If you are on the fence about the purchase , I highly recommend this to anyone. It's a great item.
Tablet is great! I bought it for my 6 year old daughter again (first one finally got the screen cracked) for Christmas and she and i love it. It has all the features you would expect from an android tablet but with nice parenting aspects to keep the kids where they should be.
good item
Does the job. Not often needed as the charge on the kindle lasts so long..
Bought this for the wife because she listens to music all the time. She enjoys the hands free aspect, especially while cooking. Myself and the kids enjoy messing with it by asking various questions - Siri is more fun to argue with though. pretty easy to set up and use, great gift for those who are hard to buy for.
It does everything a regualur tablet can do and it cheap
Alexa is exactly what I expected it to be! Best Father's Day gift.
It is very easy and lightweight to carry around and use
Basic tablet that we got for our toddler. Offers enough apps to keep her entertained and a low price point. If she breaks this I will not be too upset compared to other tablets.
Having family members who lose cables all the time, this is a great deal. Reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price. Plus the various cable colors allow me to assign colors for a person or charging station so we know when someone "barrows" a cable.
hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear
this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
I used a Nook reader for several years but got no customer service when I needed anything. The Kindle customer service is truly first class and the reader is a quality item.
My son loves this tablet. It is easy for him to navigate and extremely durable.
I have 'Alexa' in the living room. Each morning I ask her the weather forecast and plan my day. If I need to go out I ask her the traffic conditions. While watching television I can always get inside information on shows as well as the actors and actresses. While playing cards with friends and family 'Alexa always finds the right background music for us. This is a great product!
i HAD both an Echo and a Google Home. I ended up returning the Google Home and kept the Echo only. The list of skills is great and the big advantage. Also all of the CES 2017 announcements made it clear that the industry, at least at this point, loves the echo. I couldnt agree more!
I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free. Can add more than one user and profile.
This is my first kindle. Reading a book always been a pleasure but now is awesome.
This is my third Amazon Kindle and by far it is the best one. The adaptive lighting really helps as it is easy on the eyes. The battery lasts for weeks on a normal charge and charges to full pretty fast.I still enjoy the eink displays over a regular phone or tablet for extended reading periods.The kindle voyage is light weight and I was able to easily find cases and accessories online.I highly recommend the kindle voyage over the other kindle readers because of the advanced features.
This new reader is light weight and easy to use. It fits conveniently in my purse.
Runs much better than the fire stick, especially for some apps such as Playstation Vue. The fire stick is more convenient and takes less room but is not as powerful. If you are buying the product for Playstation Due then you will be returning the Fire Stick to buy this one.
This was very easy to set up & use. The speaker has great sound.
This item is one of the sweetest things I have ever brought.
It is easy to use and very handy,light. I got it for my mom.
Being an Amazon Prime member this little box made a great addition.
Bought this table for my 4 and 9 year old for Christmas. They love them!
Fast streaming of your favorite shows and games lots of memory and sd card for more memory HD view with 4K capabilities
Greatest thing since sliced bread. My wife's jealous! :)
Bought for my children. The love their tablets and the price was right
I originally bought this because of frustration in using my IPad for several websites. So I decided to try the Fire tablet. Well it did get me to the websites that IOS on my IPad didn't. But I started to investigate it more thoroughly. I checked the manual and started to have more fun. The camera works great , and the apps are great! This was to be a secondary purchase but I am using it more and more.
This Kindle works great for reading outdoors in daylight and can also download books using the Wi-Fi from the device.
A fun and informative product. It is used by the whole family.
So glad I purchased this productive it use it all the time
Fast streaming, easy setup. Does provide biased options to push Amazon products, however. Great product overall
This tablet keeps them occupied. Other kids enjoy it while they are around with them. It keeps them entertained.
I highly recommend this tablet, it is very affordable!
I am satisfied of this kindle upgrade mainly in resolution.
Bought it to use with my WeMo devices and it works like a charm. Alexa is my new best friend!
Great gift for any age. Parentallocks awesome. Expandable sd slot too
Great tablet for the kids as it includes some good educational apps and has a good case that surrounds it for durability.
One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user
This thing has major connectivity issues, save your money and wait for a later version.
The device is so simple for kids. It is great. I love the case it's really protective.
works great and you can customize it. very nice with the voice remote
There were many questions unanswered, I think apple Siri is better.
The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
My 18 year old loves her kindle paper white! Very user friendly and easy to read!
This is a good item for reading books. It is easy to use.
Very happy with the Fire TV works great with all my streaming apps Netflix, Hulu and Amazon's own video app... Best of all works great with PlayStation Vue just works flawless from the interface to many different options it offers... All around a great device from being reliable, quick boot-up, to no lagging and no buffering... Totally recommend especially for Amazon Prime members...
...really wanted to go all in when these first came out, but very glad I bided my time. Excellent product and outstanding edition to our home automation. Plus highly entertaining for music, news, weather, you-name-it. Highly recommend!
Just bought a my first house and this was a fantastic addition as I unpack. I have an Amazon Prime account which gives me amazon music, so I've just been requesting music as I unpack and clean. Solid
This is very easy for my 9-year old to use. It also works well for people of all ages in our family and it was a very good value.
I purchased a Fire in November 2015 holiday sale. I have been enjoying my Fire. A parent of mine purchased a Kindle when the device first came out. I persuaded my parent to buy an updated Kindle because of all the updates in 5 years time. Now she has to learn the newer technology.
You will not regret this purchase! The kindle holds a charge for more than a week, is super light weight, easy on the eyes, and allows you to define words with the point of a finger! It even adds defined words to a vocabulary list, so you can review them!
I really like it because i can watch a lot of movies
Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.
The screen resolution is so much better than the original Kindle. Love the backlight.
Wish it had an open market for other apps and not limited to amazon
I really like it it's going to very nice sound to it but it's a little bit slower than my echo.for some reason but other than that I really like it
I recommend you good product you can buy it at bestbuy in my favorite shop buy it now
I love this device for my kids who are way too young to trust with a $500 tablet such as an iPad. Works efficiently, my kids love it, & I love the parental control features. If something happens to it, amazon handles it quickly & if it were to break or get lost, it's cheap to replace. That being said, it obviously doesn't hold a candle to Samsung or apple's tablets. I'm not really a fan of the operating system.
What Can I Say 120 volts goes in one end and 5 volts comes out the other. WOW! High quality.
This is a great first tablet for someone. Very inexpensive and has everything you want on it
I am so glad i procrastinated in buying an e-reader.I was going to get the kindle paperwhite- then the Voyage came out- I bought it and am so happy with it- a joy to use.
My kids love it & I like it 2 tanks and is really easy to use great product..
I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube.
My kids liked it very much.It is a good worth tab.
I bought this for a retirement gift and my coworker loves it. It's perfect! Easy to set up and no hassles.
We ordered 2 of these one for our college daughter and the other our high schooler. They both absolutely love them. I have to admit we steal it every once and awhile. Love it.
Got this for my daughter & grandson for their birthday.
I decided to cut the cable and bought Amazon fire tv. That along with a high definition antenna is all I need. So easy to set up and use. Tons of apps to choose from and I love Alexi. I simply tell her what show I want, she searches through all the apps and shows me where it is. How simple is that? Love it.
Great for the internet... ....Saves my phone battery
Small and light weight. Even in a leather case. I was concerned about the small screen but was not a problem after using it for a while.
I Love Love my Fire, you get way more than you expect from this Fire Tablet, Plug into speakers GREAT Sound, Reading screens are wonderful with the ability to use Night time light, Takes amazing photo's and videos, with good quality sound, SMS access is so easy and you can even receive calls, All search engines are accessble. I am getting My little grandkids each one of these with the great tablet protecter. This tablet is Kid friendly and as a parent you can control EVERYTHING they see. Price is amazing and you get way more than you would expect from a tablet that is so affordable.
I had the smaller version of this & was looking to get rid of it & my google nexus. This is just what I wanted, it uses my Amazon prime account & takes a memory card so I can load it with all my videos I watch while at the gym.
I use it mostly to listen to music. With amazon prime (or Spotify, if that's your preference) I have almost every song that I'm interested in hearing without having to pay for anything. I haven't had the guts to order anything with it, but I'll work up the nerve eventually when I'm out of diapers or something easy.
I put off getting an e-reader for a long time thinking to myself that one more gadget was not necessary. Now that I have the Paperwhite, it's going to be my constant companion. It's very user friendly. I am brushing up on my Swedish language, and I was able to download a Swedish English dictionary so I can now not only read my Swedish books, but I am also able to look up unfamiliar words with ease. The display is very easy on the eyes - no eye strain whatsoever. All in all, I'm extremely satisfied.
Worked as expected. Was in stock and picking was fast.
The product worked great and easy to setup. Took the product back as the Fire Stick was all I needed
Great Product. I have recommended to all my family and friends
This fire was easy to set up and easy to use for emails and Internet .
Have it located in our kitchen and is great for listening to your Amazon music. Voice recognition is good and we also use the timer function often. The quality of the sound is good too with decent bass.
The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
This charger is produced by Amazon and backed by its excellent quality control and manufacturing process.
this is great, really easy to use - the playlists are fantastic
I've had a couple different Kindles & have also tried to read books on my iPad & phone. LOVE the Kindle Paperwhite. You can read it outside in the sun, by the pool, on your deck etc... & the print is always clear & visible. The battery stays charged for several days & it's small size makes it easy to carry in your purse or tote bag!
Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.
my kids love the kids fire they use it every single day. its durable.. I can put parental control on certain things.. great buy
've owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.
so far I'm enjoying my wireless headphones and sounds great
Awesome products friendly staff would defiantly do business again
Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
Got these on Black Friday for $35 each, can't NOT pick them up at that price. Perfect for Youtube, Netflix and most mobile games.
No glare ever! Easy process of getting books! Reading is made super easy
I own 3 of these kindles, for my children who are young. They can take some wear and tear, but recently one of mine quit charging. The charger will no longer connect with the port inside the kindle. The kindle itself was working just fine, but since it can no longer be charged, it is no longer functioning. I am really disappointed, and plan on buying a replacement. My children love being able to play on the kindle and for the price you really can't beat the deal.
Great to read with during the day and night. Easy to carry.
The Amazon Echo is a fantastic assistant and helps organize my busy day.
My husband loves it! He has been reading since he got it for Christmas.
My grandson love this tablet. He always keep up with it and the color was perfect for him
I got this around the holidays and I'm happy with the quality of the image and videos. You may be just fine with not having as Amazon Prime membership and just use it for light web browsing. The screen gets easily smudged but for the price, it's a great value.
The only thing that I don't like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight. If I wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read, I would not be able to see it in the sunlight. Otherwise it is terrific!
The Amazon fire tv has a better resolution 4K and it already has most Apps installed on it and you can install your own too. I haven't regretted purchasing this amazing amazon amateur!!!!
Trying to read a book on my iPad is next to impossible. The Kindle Paperwhite is very easy to read outdoors, even in bright sunshine.
The back light is a great addition to this kindle, along with the page press! It's perfect for only using one hand to read. I would highly recommend this kindle and is worth the extra money.
I like Alexa in white better than the black version. But it depends on your furniture.
This little box gives you endless TV episodes, tons of movies, 5 million songs, And Photo storage and display when linked to an Amazon prime account. It also allows you to get apps from all over the place and even play games. I am also streaming live TV with Vue thru this little tiny, shiny, black box. I am impressed.
My old tablet died..needed a new fast. This one was alot better than my old one. Clear screen videos look amazing..Sound is better than expected..It was in stock too. Overall very happy item and buying experience!
Could not believe price I got the Kindle for. Great to have when the grandchildren come to visit and want to play on it.
I have an Echo. I thought so well of it that I gave this one to my son.in.law
My kids loved this tablet and use it almost every day, battery life is pretty good for how much they use it
The Amazon Fire TV box is the best choice for your money. It runs smoothly, it's user friendly and it has a great user interface. It has 2gb of memory which is a plus, and it allows you to connect directly to your modem via Ethernet. I find this especially helpful when you are having issues with your wifi or you have many devices in your home connected to your wifi. I have not had any issues with this box!
The products works as advertised and has been satisfactory to this point. It is somewhat complicated but if the instructions are followed closely there are no problems.
Really enjoy it. there were come questions that Alexia could not answer. I use it for music a good bit
I bought this echo dot as a fourth member to our echo family. I absolutely love it.
Nice sounding speaker and by adding my Apps I can listen to my music
The new design is lighter, has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear. The light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent. The new Kindle Voyage is amazing!
Almost like reading a real book. Don't is crisp, sharp and easy to read. I've held out from buying a reader for years because I could never quite get past the fact it wasn't a book. With this new kindle I don't even notice, I am immediately immersed. Wildly better than I expected.
Great product, easy to hook up and use. Alexa is easy to use as well.
This device is excellent picture and sound. Would recommend.
I purchased these for my grand kids for Christmas to watch kid shows on and these were a great price for what I wanted.
Amazing tablet, great quality and great features!!
The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
Nice little tablet and the price was perfect. Can take it anywhere
Love this unit! Helps me stay ahead of the game. Everyone should own one.
Love it. Got it for my grandson. Since i have amazon prime. He can watch alot of free movies and games
pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand
As a charger, it works but is nothing special. With a Mk 1 Kindle Fire, it doesn't seem to charge any faster than the standard charger. And NO CABLE is included!! A Kindle-specific cable must be purchased separately! This is not mentioned in the descriptions.
Really like the Echo. Use it mainly for listening to music and shopping/to do lists.
Purchased, took home, attached to cable,plugged in. Easy to use. No problems using this charger.
I bought this kindle so I could read in the sun without having any glare. Great purchase, can read anywhere I want to.
It's great to watch all your Movies , and stream .
This tablet performs as well or better as any other tablet for a great price, no issues or complaints whatsoever!
This is an amazing product, my husband and I love it!! This is the future of TV!!
Works good for the cost. Bought this for my dad and he loves it.
Cool product. Amazon does a cool job with it. Great audio quality and like the Philips Hue integration.
Bought for grandkids for Christmas and they love them!!
This is my wife's third Kindle and continues to be her favorite method of reading and accessing the web. These are great devices
Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading.
This thing works great. I highly recommend it. Good price on sale.
I love this tablet. Very user friendly and versatile.
This is the forth kindle we have bought for grandchildren. With a spongy protective case, they take them everywhere.
We purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. They play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow. They are very durable and come with a very kid durable skin. The 2 year warranty that covers everything was the selling part for us. The one con is that you don't get google play store.
I Use this device to control lights, temperature in the living room and it works great ... Also a decent speaker on its own
Great product for the kids to keep them quiet, it a
I hope to have it set up for my disabled daughter sooon
Every day Alexa learns new skills. She sets the temperature on my Nest, waters my lawn, times my cooking, keeps my shopping list, etc. The only problem I have had is when I listen to Jeopardy and a woman contestant answers with "WHO IS ..." Alexa answers.
im an avid reader. this device it fantastic. sure beats carrying a book around.
We Love our Alexa, she keeps all of our appointments and plays great music and keeps us up to date on weather and news.
Easy to install! We bought two one for each tv!!!!
It's my first e-reader ever, so I am a novice. I like my Kindle which now is a large part of my life the same way printed books have always been. It's very compact, weighs very little, has great features (touchscreen, adjustable brightness, easy to navigate and download books). The battery really lasts a long time as advertised. I just wish public libraries had more books in the Kindle format and better interface for e-books.
Great price, works well for what i needed. No need to spend hundreds on other tablets.
This just a great tablet. A co_worker was saying that it is no as sophisticated as her $600 tablet and it isn't. But I can put one of these in every room in my house and still have money left over. This is one of the best $50 I ever spent.
I'm very happy with my Kindle. It is very practical to carry, easy to upload books into, and I love the screen. It is very easy on the eyes.
Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better.
Excellent for a first time ereader. Worth the buy.
this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch..
Able to watch so many movies, Netflix and get access to more than just the normal cable offsprings.
I picked this over the fire stick due to the user interface for PS vue, it's a much cheaper alternative to paying for cable.
My niece loves this tablet & I love the Amazon add on that lets me control what she can do, how long she has per day, and when it turns off for the night/ turns on in the morning.
Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.
I regretted buying this item.I will never recommend this to anyone
Amazing that Amazon beats Apple at the voice recognition game. Great product.
I bought this for my daughter to use. I know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free. In the end it's a great deal.
I am very happy with fire tv. i was even happier went it went on sale a week after I bought it and best buy gave me the diference back.
I bought this product to make things a little simpilar in my life. Everything from shopping lists to music to quick information on the run (weather, traffic, news even sports scores). The only knock on this is that when an Amazon Echo commercial plays and the actors say Alexa, the unit powers on and answers. I just wish there was a way this could separate my voice from the TV.
This is my 2nd Kindle. I love the ability to read anywhere no matter the light, especially at night. I don't disturb anyone with a light if I am having trouble sleeping.
Great Bang for your Bucks, thats the first thing that comes to your mind, when you hold the tablet. It feels solid, it works great and doesnt feel cheap at all. I have experience, number of low cost tablets and you feel them the moment you hold them, Agree, you cannot compare to iPad mini or other comparable brand tablets. But at this price point, I am not at all hesitant to gift someone. I cant put my head around, how are they able to offer such great quality at this price, simply amazing!!
I love the ability to just say what song I want to hear and Alexa plays it, or stops immediately when I instruct her to. The jokes and pick up lines are a crowd favorite as well.
I am really pleased with my new Kindle, I had one of the oldest versions and was reluctant at first on getting this one, but oh boy, I hit the jackpot.if you have never owned a Kindle you will be really pleased on how easy on your eyesight this thing is compared to reading on a tablet.Battery life is amazing, I turned off wifi and got over 4 weeks of battery life by reading around 1 hour a day, I recharged it before it was completely depleted.The addition of backlight is actually cool, even reading before night it did not disrupt my sleep cycle.And you get all the goodies of Amazon backing up your digital content.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.
This tablet is the perfect portable size for me.It's connectivity with other devices is great and i can use it for a lot of fun disractions during my free time
Bought the kindle fire for my kids for Christmas . So far no issues, they seem to love it.
Im an Amazon fan so it was an easy decision to buy. Good battery life for music, movies and general web stuff. Fits my hand size well. Powers up quick. Screen brightness adjusts to any conditions. I would recommend buying in store cause I had to return 2 of them with a dead pixel. The one I have now has been good for several months.
Very versatile and can be great for kids & adults.
The first one I received was doa, the second one has worked flawlessly.
Limited use if you dont want to enroll with amazon
I love this. And it's great that they keep making improvements!!
This is a great new piece of tech if you are savy with it. If not it takes a while to learn but its follow the steps
This is the eighth kindle fire I have gotten, I love them! I got one for all the members of my family
Big Echo big sound! No need for a Bluetooth speaker.
It is so easy to use even my 4 year old has been using it!
Christmas present for the kids, its strong and durable and constantly used. inexpensive as is unless you want to get the kid proof case.Apps, games, web browsing and video/photo functions are good. Do think how this item will be used as most likely its internal storage at 16gb will fill up quickly
Great way to get rid of cable. Easy to setup an de use.
Great for kids. Has many applications that can help kids learn more and easier
Loving my new Kindle, especially upgrade to having a camera!!
Alexa makes it super easy to hear our favorite songs simply by asking! No need to sort through long play lists looking for what we want.
It is very high quality device. It is easy to set up and very easy to operate. It is a lot of fun.
This product is amazing. It is so helpful and they update it with new skills all the time. I think it is one of my favorite tech products I have ever used.
We wanted I good inexpensive table to get our feet wet. This is a good one if you are comfortable getting your apps from Amazon. I do find the processor to be a little slow at times.
Gave this tablet to my son's girlfriend for Christmas . She loves it!
This is my second Amazon Fire. My first was the 7 inch and love the new 8 HD.
What can you say about this amazing product..state of the art fun and amazing capabilities.
I received this as a gift and loved it so much that I bought one for my husband.
I have had a nook for years and had a difficult time switching over to kindle despite the amazing reviews, but I couldn't pass up the price of this product. I was very pleasantly surprised with how great it is and I now use it all the time. I'm even thinking about getting my toddler one for christmas.
I bought the Echo and a few Hue light bulbs when the radio that I use to listen to NPR new in the morning died on me. I've been very happy. I didn't even have to set it up to find my radio station! I just said, "Alexa, listen to 88.9 FM," and she did it. Just like that. My kids ask her to check their math problems for their homework. We use her to check the weather before getting dressed in the morning. The lighting set up was super easy. Alexa is a nice addition to our family.
This is one of the most powerful streaming device in market. Kodi runs super smooth on this and not to mention the great features that come along with Amazon prime membership
Still working on getting to explore all the features.
its an excelent talber for the best price in market
I'm not a huge fan of the modified Android interface on this tablet, and it is FAR from the best tablet on the market. Not even close. But I am giving it 5 stars based on its value. It is a very durable and functional tablet and includes a camera AND a microSD slot for cheap, easy, expandable storage. Throw in the excellent integration with the Amazon ecosystem (if you use that) and you have a very worthwhile device. If you are not a big Amazon user, I don't think it has as much to offer, but it is still nice for an ultra-low-budget tablet.
Was easy to set up and very easy to use. For a basic tablet I would recommend it.
Great for kids. Easy to use. Great games to download.
I bought two kindles for my children and they love them. They are easy to navigate for all of them .
This was a great Christmas present for my daughter!
Very fast and super easy to use I'm very pleased with this purchase!!
I liked the amazon stick so much I upgraded to an amazon fire. I'm very happy with the purchase.
We had previously owned Kindle paperwhite version 1 and this is a substantial improvement. The new screen is much brighter and the response is quicker .
Between my wife and I we have three apple I-pads. I purchased the fire tablet for myself and one for my daughter. It is an entertainment device. You can serf, email, watch movies on line and it makes an awesome remote for my Fire TV. It really pays off if you are an Amazon prime member. It has a version of the Amazon echo- but not quite as the echo or echo dot. I love the fact that you can add a micro sd card to greatly enhance the storage. Perhaps they can teach this process to apple. After using this I have to admit that I have purchased my last IPad.
Easy to use even my 6year old can do it! We use it on a daily basis to watch Netflix and play games on it!
Love my Kindle! It's perfect for my Netflix obsession late at night! Great size and picture quality!
Bought for home automation, but havent gotten that far yet. Good for music, books, weather, etc.
I love my kindle Paperwhite in white. The battery lasts a long time without recharging. Your books are all in one compact location. you can add your own personal touch with color cases to protect your kindle. I take mine everywhere I go.
Alexa is so amazing, this is a wonderful new member of our family .she is so smart and constantly updates her self. Now I would be lost without her.
Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends
Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too.
I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.
it is great. it's a lot better than hey Siri - it understands the whole families voice without any issues
Bought for family member, was on their Christmas list.
Great product. Fast shipping. I can't wait to learn more of what Echo can do
works excellent in daylight either inside or outside and the backlight is great for nightime
Very disappointed that in order to get to my books, I have to get through ads. Didn't have this on my first Kindle Fire.
Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward.
Bought this tablet for my brother for Xmas and he loved it. He is able to watch Netflix on his tablet. Recommend it for kids. I will be buying my sister one now too.
I had the firestick but upgraded to the box. Easy to use and with the straight connection to the Internet it is super fast.
This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility.
I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!
good quality, low cost compare to iPad, i like this.
Not a bad tablet for the price. Watch movies and browse internet.
Charges incredibly fast. Definitely worth it. I use it for my phone too.
This was purchased to have a second Echo in the house. The first one I have was placed in the living/kitchen area, as I use it to play music, add notes (a lot of items to my shopping lists) and appointments/reminders to my calendar. I love having a second Echo in the bedroom to give me the news brief in the morning, give me a status of the traffic and weather conditions, play music, etc. I've noticed a lot of imitations popping up by different companies, however, Echo is the best and has become an integral part of our house and lives. It sounds dramatic, but it's definitely true. Amazon constantly updates and adds new abilities/features. The ability to link it to lights, thermostat, etc. let's me think we are keeping up with the Jetsons! Highly recommend buying an Echo!
I quit cable all together and stream everything I watch using this box.
Wish I had ordered another one so that I would not have to change it from room to room
I purchased this as a gift for my granddaughter. She is 6 yrs old and loves it. it's easy to use and she can scroll between programs without problem,
work great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's very light, comfortable to handle and very responsive.
Bought it for my mom,it's going to be easy for her to use.
Links to your Amazon Prime account and you can watch thousands of movies, tv shows and get endless apps.
The best tablet for the price! All three of my children have one & they are worth it!
Of course some of the shows don't come in the greatest sometimes but love this product and the best is I am saving money from not bothering with the cable companies and having a huge bill or the next month wondering why the cable bill went up in price.
Great item. Timely transaction. 2 thumbs up! GREAT
i haven't been able to use it a lot yet. for now only use for music.
It's exactly what I was looking for. My sister was very happy with it and it meets her needs.
Overall excellent. I just wish the speaker was a bit loader and richer.
I bought Two Echos. One for home and one for work. Very nice to just say "Alexa play my music" or "Alexa what is the local weather forecast?" I highly recommend this wonderful entertainment item! Also, very convenient to take on trips that you are staying with wifi. Easy pac too!
Works well and great for travel. Small and portable
I guess it's ok...All the apps are in need of updating. Amazon won't or can't update them. There help center did nothing.
Very good product, clear sound, unique shape, good connection
This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.
This product does too many things to even list. I enjoy listening to music, getting weather and traffic reports and just getting silly jokes. I also like that here are weekly email updates about he product.
I bought these tablets for my grandchildren, ages 8 & 11, because they love playing games on mine when they come to visit me. Oh the smiles on their faces when they opened them up :)
I bought this for my son who has a speech disability. He uses it to communicate as well as play games. Great parental controls
Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
I love, love my Echo. At a command it will play any songs my mood dictates at that moment.
Bought this tablet just to use in 1 room. It works great!
Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
Nice little tablet. Works well for watching movies and listening to music. Internet use and playing some games can create slow response times.
it is very nice to be able to get all the shows and movies I want to watch
Great product. Great value. Worth every penny. Ads do not interrupt reading or alter the experience significantly.
If you don't have cable this is a good thing to have. Great product. & you can even jail break it.
Bought the tablet at a great price. Wish i would have gotten more
Got this tablet for a great price. Works well and has a fast processor.
I just prefer live TV. When you purchase these don't forget to buy an antenna so you can watch network TV and local news.
Compact, great look without that super bright look of tablets that seems to strain my eyes when reading for a while. Not much as far as tablet features, but as just an e-reader this is the best out there for now
I love this echo everybody in my family loves the echo. kids play music ask Alexa questions all the time and they are adding new things all the time.
I've owned a couple of Kindles. This one is my favorite thus far. The screen is a little too sensitive for my liking but other than that, great!
This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
"Ok, I will rate your Echo. Your Echo has great sound to play all your favorite Spofity songs. It can give the hours to local restaurants, provide the weather and corny jokes. You can call or text your contacts on their mobile devices and call in from mobile devices as well. The voice-activated Echo does these things and so much more. Your Echo deserves a solid 5 stars."
Definitely a good product children of all ages in elementary school.
This item is ideal for kids to play games and a whole lot more.,my hubby even have one and he enjoys his and I love the picture quality.
It's certainly better than the original kindle. The touchscreen is hard to get used to and it's easy to accidentally forward through several pages or chapters if you fall asleep with your finger on the screen. It is also difficult to look a word up in the dictionary if it's at the top of the screen because highlighting it brings the home screen. It is better viewing in light and because it has it's own light is much more convenient is the dark.
Great product. Love using it for reading and search.
I bought this for my daughter who is in college. She likes it and carries it many places, even hiking. She says it works very well for her.
Good size for kids. Recommend buying a case for it since its small
Great item ! Bought one for my 20 yr old as a Christmas gift . Ended up going back and getting one for my 11 yr old and myself as well. I am not good with electronics & this is easy to use.
If your familiar with Echo, you know what you're going to get. Alexa does not have all the answers however. Price is pretty much the same everywhere.
This is a great tablet for gaming, movies and of course reading. The child's version is awesome also.
This Fire tablet was worth every penny of the $35 price tag on Black Friday. We bought 6 of them as gifts and should've bought 6 more. I could've handed them out to a few others that were jealous. Lol
I purchased this for our goddaughter and while the price is amazing, and the tablet is acceptable for low overhead use, I set up the same tablet for my daughter and it is too slow for my use.
My kids love asking random questions and it's been alot of fun.
Powerful and quality sound, love the portability. Just don't understand why this one can't read my notifications while the dot can.
Not a lot of ink, but decent bang for the buck. Don't be fooled by the $100 "original" price, it is always cheaper.
Works good for price. My kid likes it very much. Good value for money
She understands the requests well and plays music or does as instructed. Siri should take notice
very good just don't forget to ask for the none promo one
I took advantage of the $89 for one and bought 2 of them! Really like amazon music and Alexa!!!
My children love playing their games on this tablet. It works well.
I learn more and more every day what this product can do
It's a great product for my son and I love bestbuy
If you stream everyday, it is worth the investment for the 4k box vs the fire stick. More powerful, more storage, more time to watch with less loading times.
Had purchased one of these for my family for Christmas and they absolutely loved it. Bought the Echo Dot for a co-worker and they wouldn't stop talking about it. Decided to buy my wife this for her birthday and all I can say is Wow! Super easy to set up, a blast to use, and connects to all sorts of connected home devices like light switches and wifi router. Plays Jeopardy and reads you the news in the morning along with playing music on command. Love setting alarms, reminders, adding to a shopping list, and making purchases on Amazon by voice. Definitely buy this if you want to make your home so much dinner!
excellent product for the pricelightweight user friendly
I like the tablet it has a slot for a memory card for extra storage. It is easy to use and inexpensive.
It's a good device for children because they don't know any better
Great to read books and it do almost everything a table will do
Great item easy to use and setup fast and great for surfing the web yes I would recommend
This is my second Kindle Fire and I wouldn't be without one. Excellent little device for reading books and playing games. Use it daily to watch Netflix.
Overall I was a little skeptical because this wasn't the product I wanted. Turns out, it's amazing!
Great tablet if your looking for something easy to set up and use! !
Well done Amazon - easy to set up and use - well made product.
works great in bright sunlight, used it at the beach
The 2015 Amazon Fire TV is the better media streamer for this price. Fast processing and great image resolution when used as a open source media player. Highly recommend.
Kids love it can downloead lots of games great charge system
Wish it searched the Internet like Siri. But over all it's super cool. Does a lot. And voice recognition is great!
Pretty cool device. I mainly use it to stream music. I'm sure she could do some more things than I have asked her to but she does most of what I want her to
I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She had been using a Kindle in the past and needed something new.
The tablet works great! No problems or concerns! Great for kids also.
This is one of the best on the market great to watch
This is a great tablet for my son he enjoyed it would definitely recommend
Bought it for my 89 year old mom. She has enjoyed reading on it. Easy to use
I love the fire tv for so many reasons! It is easy to take along anywhere and you can easily add apps, no need for cable!
Got this when it was on sale to replace my old Kindle Paperwhite. Makes for a great tablet as well as an e-reader. Love all the different apps! And the blue color is so pretty!
Great Tablet for Beginner. Easy to use and navigate.
I bought this to download videos to watch while going on a long road trip. It worked perfect for that.
This is my third Echo. The secret is the array of microphones. It hears you over music and in your natural speaking voice. Very helpful and a good speaker. Easiest way ever to connect your phone to a Bluetooth speaker. "Alexa, Bluetooth connect," and you are done.
I like this product, still getting to learn how to use it.
This is an amazing product, I can't get enough of it! I use it everyday for hours, never have to pay for movie tickets with this box, plus it is also great for other apps, games, netflix, tv shows, it's up to you!
Purchased for my kids but it was hard to navigate and ended up with purchasing an iPad
I think this is a great tablet. I bought 3 of them. You can't beat this for the price.
Both my Boys, ages 3 and 7 absolutely LOVE their tablets! I couldn't be happier with them and very satisfied with the price!
For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.
I got this on black Friday for my mom for christmas. She loves it. She never likes my presents so this is great.
Great sound and smart just wish the volume didnt have to b manually turned.
Great purchase was gift for friends and they love it!
Excellent for kids. Great warranty and cool features!!
Bought this at Best Buy since I had a $10 reward coupon so only sent $40 for this tablet. Short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and I kinda like Amazon's new OS running on this tablet better than Android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. As far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease (although installing new apps are a bit slower than on Android) the apps have installed are Facebook,Linkedin, Overdrive, CNN, Pandora, Pinterest, Skpe all run fine. You can even run games on this $50 device, games like Sky Force, Real Racing 3 (these game have high graphics) run surprisingly smooth. Videos on Netflix, HBO Now, Pluto Tv and Youtube look great even though they are not HD. Sound is just ok (my smartphone sounds better) and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not IPS. Battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking Facebook, surf the web and gaming. Already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.I not a Prime Member but purchase a lot from Amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. This tablet has been rock solid for the week I have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. Was going to buy the Amazon Fire HD but since my last $270 Amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. Amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's I disagree with. Now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market (looking at you Apple Ipad and Samsung) then this is not for you, but for others who need a device to do everyday task (just like your smartphone) then this is the one don't let the cheap price fool you.
I bought this tablet for my grand daughter. She loves it! Her parents and I love the fact that she uses it to read books. Perfect!
I was very shock how fast this tablet is. It's just the right size and speed; the performance is better than most of the tablets in this price range. Go and get one.....its perfect for the young ones.
I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far.
Easy to setup but doesn't do everything without additional products. Better than google home.
I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I'm reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don't know what I'd without this gem.
Just as good as amazon suggests it to work. I use ut every day
I'm using the Echo and Samsung's hub as the centerpieces of my home automation system. Since buying the Echo I've also added several Dots to build out the system. It's a lot of fun to work with.
Amazon Echo is a fun, easy to use and good value products.
Been in my wish list for long time and purchased this recently. Was worth a purchase
Alexis had to learn news skills before it was useful. Getting better
Easy to navigatePerfect for little ones  Buy a screen protector too !
Bought two for the kids at Christmas, they love them!
The reader does the job. Easy to use and easy to read.
My 3 year old daughter loves playing on her fire. The apps are all very entertaining and easy enough for her to use.The only thing I have had difficulty with is accessing youtube or the internet.
Got this for my 3 year old along with a kid proof case and he loves it and for the price it's perfect! Tons of free apps for him too!
This echo simplifies my daily life activities and is worth every penny.
This is great for reading books or letting your kids play games and keep them off your phone.
Bought it for my granddaughter for her birthday and she loves it.
This is my first "smart" product, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm still learning everything that it can do. So far, so good, but I have noticed a few glitches. Overall, I really like it. I can't wait to set it up with some home automation.
Bought this Kindle because I could not read my older one in the sunshine. This fits the bill.
This was a birthday gift for my daughter but I must say I want one for myself! Great sound and easy to operate.
This is an amazing piece of hardware. The Amazon Echo is very user friendly and my girlfriend loves how the echo interfaces with her Phillips Hue and simple it is to operate. I am definitely looking at getting another one for my mother for her birthday in the upcoming months.
I like that I can control the time and content that my kids view.
Logging in with a password can be difficult since the typed lettersare not shown, even temporarily, so inadvertent typos require guesswork to find.Signing out of e-mail is not clear, if it can be done.Some "free" downloads fail because of lack of payment.Allowing for my lack of skills. I was hoping for a little more.It was OK fort basic stuff.
Bought this as a gift for my aunt and she loves it. Easy to get connected and set up. She is totally non-techny and was able to do it herself. Great buy!
This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.
The best thing ever. Getting rid of cable was due to this.
This tables is fast and easy to use. I love the reading books in it and watch movies.
Truly glare free in any light! Very easy to download books from Amazon including linking to my local library.
Bought as a birthday present for my GF. She uses it daily, and loves it.Easy to use, and convenient for those who are afraid to go full touch screen(they prefer buttons).
Definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on Black Friday weekend
bought this for my 6 year old grandson who's a bit rough but loves to play games and read...he loves it
Battery life great, cameras + touring aps + music aps + radio AP make this a great addition to my Honda Valkyrie for road trips.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old. I was a big hit. I love the 8" screen. The price was perfect for my budget.
I bought a couple of dots first since I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money. We enjoyed the dots so much, I bought us an Echo. The speakers are so much better on the Echo than on the Dots, which I already knew from reviews. I have it in my kitchen and can listen to all kinds of music while I am cooking. Echo will tell you jokes, news and weather as well.Very happy with this purchase.
I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked
Great product very useful and conventional. Alexa is the Best
Is very good on the camera and features will recommend
Great item for the home we have used this item daily now
The Fire TV has been a great addition to my home theater. It has a polished interface, and quality feeling remote. I especially appreciate the fact that there's an ethernet port included on the Fire TV. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the Fire TV.
It's a great beginner tablet for kids allows you to ensure your kids are viewing and playing contents for their age.
I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!
Way faster then the stick. And better quality. Worth the extra money. Especially for kodi
This is a great tablet for its price point. The Apps are easy to use and the durability of the tablet is great.
For low price it works great for everything that we need to use it for.
I bought this table for my 8 year old nephew and he love it a bit small but for him its good
The product was easy to set up, and is easy to use. I love that it is hands free.
Love the blue tooth remote, does freeze up from time to time
This is just the right size and price for my kids. For just playing the games, watching netflix, or just cruising the net, this is a great value.
Love my Echo, it was easy to set up, and easy to use.
I bought this tablet for my daughter and I love the parental control features! The tablet works wonderfully with excellent memory for storage!
Keeps my daughter busy, lots of app choices indeed
Bought this as a Father's day gift for my dad. He loves it and it's easy to set up and use.
I was surprised how much I like my new tablet. It is better than my previous tablet.
I was surprised at how much I like this amazon fire tv. I own a Apple TV and a roku. I really like it because I have amazon prime and amazon unlimited music and this really makes those services shine! It's nice to watch the prime provided content, movies, tv shows, and amazon original series. The Alexa inabled remote is also very nice.
I purchased this for my husband who has been so busy that reading for pleasure just wasn't happening as much as he liked. If he'd take his tablets to read for pleasure he would get distracted doing work rather than reading for pleasure. He now makes the time to have some time off and is enjoying novels again. Good pricing. Now we are considering getting Kindles for each of our Grandchildren too.
Much better than my previous ereader; Highly satisfied.
The amazon fire tablet is awesome..my kids love it
The only complaint is that you get a year free of Amazon free time but after that first year you start getting charged till you cancel.
Absolutely love this new Kindle! Light, sharp, glass touchscreen and adaptive front light. Very easy to use and read!
Better cost effective tablet for basic usage of browsing
Makes Dumb TV Smart, very small package. Slides under flat screen TV, remote works everywhere, no lost signal. Fire works better wireless...weird...Voice control is a nice feature, but the remote gets me there faster.
Great little tablet for the price, It does everything I need it to do. It has tons of apps, easy to set up and use.
I don't know what took me so long to purchase this item system offers everything that could want for my tv experience in one package.
It's great to have a, "know it all" in the house now. I've been trying to stump her all day but she keeps giving me answers.
Easy to install. Super easy for everyone to use. Can't imagine tv without it!
Easy to use tablet. Good price. Great for beginners as well as intermediate users. Fun!
Bought this as a 2nd tablet for my mom gor xmas. Its been well over 6 months, it is still going amazingly well!
Good product, decent sound, not as good as Sonos though.
For this price everybody should have one of this tablet, it works really good
I use this for music and for creating lists or for finding out what is going on in the world. I also use it to control other smart devices. Still elarning and it does have a little bit of a way to go to be really useful.
I liked this product. A real good value. Was very happy with the customer sales person that helped me find what i was looking for and demonstrated how it worked and the benefits of one brand verses the other that i was considering.
I bought this for my 9 year old grandson. He asked for a tablet for Christmas.
It works like expected. The photos are not as good as my cell phone but ok enough for the price
This tablet is ok for a kid. I was expecting more because it's a Fire brand.
We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However, awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.
don't have a smart tv, so this fire tv is perfect for downloading Netflix, vudu, and any other apps. a must for tv watchers
This has all the benefits of the Echo for a slightly better price. I also love the portability.
I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base.
This is embarrassing. I purchased one game from amazon app store. The app crashed right away after I started it. I don't know how Amazon tested all these apps on their own device. But the experience is really bad.
Great streaming device would definitely recommend this to anybody
Grandchild loves the tablet. Easy to set up and child and adult user griendly
This is one of my best buys for the year so far. Fire tv is super fast and love that you can hard wire it to the Internet. So much can be done with it aside from watching tv and movies which is a huge plus in itself. Love this thing.
Needs to have higher internal memory to be better.
Bought as a gift but have one as well...love it! Great price!
Great gift !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was a great replacement for my previous Kindle, which is more than 5 years old. However, I liked my old Kindle well enough, and I couldn't justify an upgrade considering the more than $100 price tag. That's why I waited for a one-day sale to pick up the Paperwhite.
It's a good tablet for the value. Downside is there's no Google Play Store access. So you're limited to apps in the Amazon app store.
Was easy to use and easy to set up programming was easy to do
I never thought I'd use the echo nearly as much as I do. It controls our lifx lights, tv with a harmony, light switches by wemu, and connects to our vivint security system. I love it. It's really cool. I bought one for my brother.
I don't have cable so it would not be valuable to me
Bought it on black friday sale. Use it as a ODB reader for car and reading books every once in a while, for $35 there's nothing wrong with it
I bought this for a family member who has very limited use of her hands due to a spinal cord injury. She lives in a nursing facility. My hope was that she could enjoy her favorite music and listen to broadcasts of her favorite sports team simply by speaking to the Echo/Alexa device. My big concern was that she would not be able to use the voice commands due to her weak voice.Happily, I can report that she loves it and is able to successfully use the voice commands. We have it sitting on her night stand about two feet next to her. And I know that she loves it not only because she tells me but because I can see, using the Alexa app on my smartphone, each and every time she interacts with the device throughout the day. I can even listen to the audio of each of her interactions with the device. And I am not exaggerating when I say that she often interacts with Alexa/Echo over 100 times throughout the day!So far, she uses Alexa/Echo to listen to her favorite music through my Prime Music subscription. We recently purchased a few songs that she couldn't find in Prime Music. She also often asks it to tell her a joke and check the weather outside. She says the staff at the nursing facility where she lives seem to be amazed by the device as well and she often demonstrates its capabilities asking it to tell her who the current president is. Currently, I am helping her become familiar with its ability to play local radios stations, especially the ones that broadcast Kentucky Wildcat sports games. When I reminded her that it could read books aloud, she requested a chapter of the Bible; I found a beautiful professionally produced audio version with professional voice actors on Audible.This product has been a real revolution in my aunt's day-to-day life and the Prime Music connectivity is bringing her great pleasure and stimulation. I am giving it five stars because she is able to use it unassisted simply with her voice and because the Alexa app gives me a new fascinating way to keep track of one aspect of her day. My aunt hopes that a future update will allow it to control her TV and make/receive phone calls.
Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well.
This is one of the best tablets in this price range.
Amazing! The tablet is everything the kids wanted! It not only helps with learning. But my oldest son got college text books on it! Great product
Brought this item for my Mentally Challenged brother. He loves it.
Easy to use meet standards my kids really enjoyed it
I bought the Fire TV in able to watch Prime Videos. I have a Smart TV and an Apple TV. They all work about the same they each have their unique features features.
Amazon echo does so much and fun to use..I would definitely recommend this item
As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying.
Great product if you need to read e-books, good battery life.
For starters i had the Amazon stick for a while & got tired of that due to all the buffering issues, but what can you expect out of that little stick? so when this went on sale, i decided to upgrade & i'am so happy i did, it works great & has reduced the buffering to a minimum, but like anything online depends on the site your on. Love the fact you can speak into the remote and pull up the site you want.
Works very well. I do ish it had some of the features of the Google. Picked this one cause it can have three accounts at one time.
I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
Works great with Amazon Prime Music. Very impressive speech recognition. (On the other hand, Amazon Prime Video Streaming is not Included in Apple TV or Roku apps.)
Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
I didn't really think I would enjoy it as much as I do. Absolutely perfect for our master bathroom. Constant music, weather, time, and useful info to get the day going.
Take out the box from packaging, connect box, turn on the box and watch Amazing Amazon tv just like that.....any easier and easier or convenient it can not get. Great buy at Best But.
Loved the product. First I was disappointed that I could not download Google Store apps but a Quick Google Search fixed that Issue and now I can download any Google Store Apps. The Battery Life is amazing as I was able to Watch around 4 Full Movies on a Single Charge. Performance is great as Games like Marvel Champions Modern Strike Online had no issues. Able to add an SD Card is just perfect as I dont have to worry about Storage for downloading Movies or Apps. Speakers are better then my Samsung Galaxy S7. For the Price point of this Tablet there is not a single thing to Complain. If I have to Brightness of the Screen can be better.
I had an insignia tablets before they are very low on saund
Had to return TWO tablets b/c they had dead pixels. Third was fine!
Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
I debated between Echo and the Dot, and went with the Echo, due to the sound quality. I can play music and can hear it all through the house.. the quality is great. Still learning new things.. fun to play with!
I use this for my daughters educational apps. She loves it. perfect size for her hands and still big enough for her to enjoy Peppa Pig.
I love the Amazon Fire TV box, Amazon makes great products that are great for anyone.
Easy to use for my mom and toddler. just like any kind of android device.
Worth for what you pay for.. Basic use is ok......
My husband loves it and so do I now that I understand how to work it You must start your question off by saying Alexa.......
So far this has been a great product. Very easy setup and the remote fits nicely in your hand, similar to Apple TV remote but larger
Great for reading books on. Has lots of other features as well.
for $50 this tab does what it is supposed to do. It has the gaming apps and social networking apps. You can take photos and videos. Its like a poor man's ipad.
Picked up my fire hd 10 from the store on Saturday. it took most of the day to update the software. You would think that he software would just update to the current software . even that was not a big deal. after that I had some issues with the battery so what I did was bring it back to a factory reset. what that did was keep the software build and battery life was better. I have not had any issues with the appstore and I also sideload apps that aren't available to the amzon appstore. all in all this tablet has been great for me. my other tablet was kindle hd 8.9 and it has service my good for the last 4 yrs
Great. Great quality. It's like reading a real book
After a lot of internal debate, review reading and getting tired of trying to hold onto my iPad in bed, I broke down and purchased this e-reader. To which I am truly glad that I made the purchase.It is light, easy to read, has a great battery life and a does not have the distractions of a smart phone or tablet. For these reasons, I'd highly recommend adding this tech to your arsenal.
Good built-in speakers but would love the capability of connecting to a Bluetooth speaker like the dot.
i love the alexa voice service i can turn on my lights and order pizza with my voice through the fire tv.. the apps are the same as any other media device.. games are good too..
I bought this as a gift for my daughter to replace an older version. She was happy to have a new Kindle after about 5 years.
We have bought many kindle before and they always work put great for us and the kids can use them easily. I love that I can set the kids profile so they can't make purchases I just wish you could set them to stay in the child's profile until an adult takes it out.
I love the Echo...have been using it constantly to play music, for reminders, calendar entries, etc. Very satisfied
The Kindle Paperwhite is a compact e-reader that is so easy to use and download books - many of which are free from various websites. The light is great so one can read in a dim hotel light or in the dark.
Nice device, but I wish it was wireless. Having a cord minimizing the mobility.
The Fire is performing everything I would wish for in a tablet. Browser is working fine, and I enjoy reading on it.
Haven't had the Echo very long but so far I love it. News and weather when I get up, music as I take care of cores. Ordered Smart plugs for my lamps. Can't wait to try them out!
Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!
I was looking to bu an affordable tablet but with all the necessary features and this tablet is great. Good touch, display and speed. Very happy to buy this but would have been happier if I would have got some discount.
The Amazon Fire tablet is easy to use, easy to download books, and I love it
My family received this Echo at Christmas, and it is used almost daily. Listening to music, adding to shopping lists, asking trivia, etc. we loved it so much, this now lives downstairs, and we have an Echo Dot in each bedroom.
Alexa is really awesome, she does all kinds of cool things to make life easier. My only recommendation to Amazon is that they try to make her more 'intuitive' and remember habits or repeated phrases.
Thinking that this would be just another gadget proved to be way off. The Amazon Echo has far exceeded our expectations! The sound is stellar and the timing is spot on!
Great sound in a small package for the money and I would buy again.
Overall great Bluetooth speaker and for general reference-but you'll get a lot of "I don't know" on questions not already in her skills
Love it. Great price. Great features. Easy to set up and can just use double side tape to hide right behind tv.
Great product - Can see very clearly when reading in the dark or in the bright sunlight!
Works well great outdoors in the sun. Better than iPad for books.
Great for grandkids, my six year old grandson loves it.
it works. does what its supposed to. looks good beside my black tv. and really good on my white mantle.
I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job
Bought this for my 9 year. This is the 2nd one he has had because he literally wore the first out.
This is a great starter tablet for the price - It is easy to use, expandable and cheap and able to use for surfing and reading and games
The price on this. Holy cow. It's a great little device for the price. It's a nice upgrade for my child whose older fire was getting a little dated.
Perfect gift for friend or family member!!! Very easy to use!
My first kindle paperwhite lasted several years, and I used it a lot! When it quit, I immediately went to Best Buy and purchased another one. After only about five weeks, my new kindle stopped working. I could no longer turn the page again, just like my old one. I went back to Best Buy and they exchanged it for a new one. If it had been just about another week, they would not have exchanged it. I thought the Kindle was a great product, but was disappointed that it had quit again. This time, I bought the insurance plan. Best Buy treated me great. There was never an issue whether they would replace it or give me a refund. Even though I did not have my original receipt, only had my charge card bill, there was not a problem.
I am still learning about my Amazon Fire tablet. It was easy for my to download books I wanted. I think I am going to really like it once I have learned more about it.
works as intended and this is the 2nd unit purchased
brother-in-law had one and we messed around with it.
Awesome product. Everything works great and easy to use
So far the best streaming box out there you can easily download third party apps and run Kodi etc... Can't beat it
I own a Echo and have now purchased a second one for my Daughter as my whole family loves to ask questions and play music.. I would recommend the Echo to everyone. Music is crystal clear and volume can be lowered or raised upon voice command.
This thing has everything you need to watch movies and shows in 4K. I watch it almost everyday.
Amazon Fire TV is the best streaming device money can buy and will cancel cox, directv and any other programming paying for. It works smoothly with good internet service and cable modem. Best device on market to stream movies and tv shows. Will keep buying them for my family.
She's super awesome!! Definitely recommend! She helps me remember to do lists and she plays awesome music with Amazon prime
The speaker is great and the microphone is good but overall works just as needed.
I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend
Perfect size. Exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend this to anyone.
I bought this for my grandson and he likes it a lot He is only 5 years old and it is perfect size for him He wanted a red one but likes the blue.We put abc mouse on it and he is able to find it for himself. Great price
Bought this tablet last year and is still working fine! Definitely not an iPad but does a lot of things that an iPad can do! Would purchase this product again.
Like it better then the nabi jr. More like a real tablet. Actually it is with the extra protective case
I purchased this Kindle Fire for my husband and he loves it. He had an older model which he loved but my dog accidentally broke it. This updated version has so many new features which he loves!
I found this product to be faster the other competitors products
I love this tablet! I will buy a bigger one next,I'm tired of cumbersome laptops,and this goes Anywhere,use my phone as hot spot,I have windows phone,and my fire is android...too heck with the Galaxy phone,lol with a Galaxy,lol.
I am very pleased with the purchase. I use Alexa to listen to my favorite TuneIn radio station in a foreign country, set timers when I'm cooking, ask the time in different cities in the world or basic culture questions. She responds to everything. If I want to play music, she will default to Amazon Prime. If you have the membership, it is very convenient to have Alexa. I have even placed orders on Amazon with my voice. I also have Hue lights so Alexa is the one turning off my house lights at the end of the day...ah, and I can ask her to do so from the upstairs level. I think this purchase is one of the best I've made this year. I am sure there is much more to tap on (no pun intended), and I'll find out as I use Echo more. For now, I totally recommend.
this is a fun & valuable tablet.we(three of us ) all enjoy games & the reading stories.
Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.
It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
Barely 4k content and it lags a lot. Not worth it. Returned!
I bought for the wife for a Christmas present to replace her old Barnes and Noble nook . She loves it , its lighter,faster and has a lot of newer apps on it . great cheap reader.
Love the ease and convenience of Amazon Echo......there are so many things that "she" can do with just a "voice command". Our favorite is turning on the lights, controlling the NEST, and playing music!!
Works well. The kids love it can watch everything on it.
This Tablet was purchased as a gift for a friends mother who's not that handy with computers so this was perfect for her she loves it.
My grandsons are very entertained with the tablets.
I bought this for my daughter after having previously used a kindle fire hd 7. This kindle was the perfect size for her and she cannot stop reading books off of it.
I use the device while riding a stationary bike and elliptical trainer. Perfect for that use. When using it other times I would prefer a larger screen. But this is a very good lower cost item.
Bought this for my son to encourage his reading ,and very pleased with this device. I have sideloaded the ability to rent library books and it works well. He can read easily without tiring his eyes or needing to go to library frequently. Since I have to drive him everywhere it helped both of us.  I wish there were more apps available and native library rental specifically.
I already had the Kindle Fire 7", and this KF8 not only has a bigger picture screen but is faster.
Love this thing. Carry Alexa from room to room. Was a little tricky setting her up but I have teens who figured it out. Haven't had it that long and there is plenty of things you can use it for like calender and shopping list. The more you use it the more it does. It is a learning process but so glad I got it.
I had a hard time trying to work this it could not understand me most of the time everything seem to be hard to work for me.
Super light and love the color. Very easy too carry around :)
Many of our questions to her she miss interpreted or replied as not understanding what we were looking for. Distance for her to hear us was minimal. I returned this one and purchased the "Google" and this one is much better and more knowledgeable with answers. Both devices recommend using the phone app and also making other purchases for more usage of items that may be available. I didn't expect additional charges and so I'm not to thrilled with either one but I did keep the Google device in hopes of better to come in the future.
The Amazon Echo is a great addition to any home. It is a wealth of information and can be linked to other devices in your home for home automation. The echo even helps my kids with their homework.
Excellent I love it!!!! It is the best assistant!!1
I bought this tablet for my 9 year old nephew and he loves it. It is easy to setup and very user friendly. Picked up a case for protection.Buy far the best bang for your buck for an entry level tablet.
Generally it is good. Sometimes the touch screen does not respond well.
Love this item, faster and better than firestick and other devices
Can't blue tooth to my speaker without slecting it from a list...there is no list...
I have been researching the different Kindles, and decided on this one. I think I made a great choice.
So my old kindle stopped working recently. Not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. So I checked with Best Buy and saw they had Kindle on sale for $60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. I especially like that I can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. So far I have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.
I used this charger right away and my Kindle is up and running. I like the compact size.
How do you rate a charger--something you need, but don't really want It works, so it is okay.
Wife bought this as gift, she was going to buy the newest one but they recommended this one instead, good call!!
I bought about four of these tablets as gifts for family members. This tablet does not come with a lot of features. Very affordable and Amazon builds a decent tablet.
Easy to use tablet good for the kids and around the house. Only issue is that sometimes it takes long to recharge.
Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas.
I love my Kindle Paperwhite. I can read at night without my eyes bothering me. The builtIn light is an awesome feature. The screen looks just like the pages of a book.
My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help
Extremely sturdy construction. This is a great tablet and very durable. It can take a fall and keep working as if nothing happened. I would recommend this for someone who has a special needs child. I would definitely buy another one.
I bought this tablet for my 10 year old grandson. He loves it! It is very easy to operate and has a great display.
Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift.
The Kindle Fire is a wonderful addition to my laptop. There are times I just don't feel like using the big laptop. And the Kindle is nice to have next to my bed for when I am awake at all hours. Love the ease of use and all the things it can do.....and I don't know the half of it! Great item.
My first real tablet. It works awesome for books and playing movies. Even though it is limited to only amazon apps it is fast and has a lot of free apps to play with. If your looking for a tablet to use for mostly internet I would look else where. It is limited to only one browser app that and the music play pack through headphones is kind of weak at least for my taste. Movies look & play great which is one of the things I wanted it for. Good battery life and overall quality. So for the price this is hard to beat.
needed a tv in our kitchen, wasn't looking for huge or fancy for this. so the 32 inch was perfect for us
Purchased as a gift for my mothers birthday she will not put it down. She exclaimed how easy it was to pack for her trip last month and she said she can read it even when all the lights are off. She wonders how she has lived without one all this time and would highly recommend it to everyone.
Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too.
Really enjoy it . Would recommend it to others. Thanks
I like the $39.99 firestick better. This one does not have all the stuff the other one has and the sales clerk saud that it did.
It is perfect for anyone and especially for a child moving on from a Kurio. It is easily regulated by a parent with the parental controls.
I am amazed by the touch quality and the feel of the page turning.
I never thought I would go tech for reading but the kindle has been a great addition.
Perfect tablet for younger kids. It is inexpensive so when they inevitably break it you will not be so mad.
I look forward to coming home to Alexa. She's awesome!
I AM GLAD I GOT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS E A SECOND ONE FOR NEW YEARS!!
this is a good product for daily use, we like it till now.
does everything i need it to do for my business needs
Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
As a tablet noob this was the perfect tablet to start with simple to use and even simpler to understand. I like every thing about it now I want a larger screen.
I wish I would have purchased the Fire before I bought my iPad mini. I would have saved over $200!
This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
Apps are easy to find . I would recommend this product to a friend
Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. My first problem didn't paired.
Bought 2, 1 did not work out of the box. Too slow, too much trouble to setup and requires amazon account to use. Returned both items
Easy to maneuver through the various channels. This could replace my Satellite co.
I was looking for something inexpensive but with a large enough screen that I could use it to read musical charts off of when I perform and this little tablet has been a great solution for me. The screen is sharp and bright, the wifi picks up fairly weak signal and makes good use of what's available, the file hierarchy is fairly simple to navigate. It seems built fairly well and for 39$, I'm happy.
Purchased these for my boys (7 & 10) to read/listen to books and work on educational apps. Compact and great for use during traveling and away from home. Like the parental options to restrict use during designated hrs.
My daughter loves this. It isn't an ipad but it does all that a good tablet should do with ease.
I bought this product for my three-year-old son. The operating system is slightly complicated unlike the user-friendly iPad. Fortunately, it serves it's purpose as there are many books, apps, and movies fingertips.
Love the tablet. Great reviews for the amazon kindle
Great color, great item, i bought it as a replacement for another brand, very happy with this purchase
Bought the Echo originally in black, but had to exchange it due to unresponsiveness. I think I got a dud, but changed it out for the new white Echo and it works great. Must have for AMZ Prime members since you can get prime only Alexa deals, play AMZ prime music library free, and use it to turn on/off lights (using WeMo).
Great item. The sound is good. The microphone is very sensitive. Alexa is good and hopefully will get smarter with more added features.
Got this as an upgrade to my Kindle Touch. Page turns are crisp (the pressure-sensitive page buttons on the sides are a nice addition). I especially like the self-adjusting brightness. Very happy with the purchase. Battery life is great so far, even with the backlight on.
Great experience! Purchased online, pickup in store
A gift for my grandsons. They love it! Easy to use
I am happy with this streaming device. Easy to access and provide all the app that I am looking for.
I purchased several of these tablets during the holidays as gifts. Everyone absolutely loves the FireHD8, especially those with the prime memberships. My only regret is not purchasing one for myself.
Inexpensive, No need to worry about it getting broken/lost
Having recently received a Kindle Fire HD as a gift, I knew that hooking it up to my computer to charge it daily was not going to be convenient. That's when I found this little jewel along with the Kindle Fire AC charger. And they both work like a DREAM!. My desk stays uncluttered and the cord allows me to keep the Kindle plugged in while I read in bed or listen to music. It's well worth the price for the convenience it provides!
I no longer have to worry about my phone dying on trips. This charges my phone about 4 times. Great product. I highly recommend it.
I got it for my mom, That's all I have to saythanks
This tablet from Amazon can do most things like the bigger more expensive tablets at a fraction of the cost. The two complaints I have with it which are minor is the camera is not very good especially in low light and the battery does not last as long as an Ipads. Other than that it has plenty of apps and things that it can do like Netflix etc.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.
I truly love my echo, it is great addition to my home automation setup.
My nephew is 3 years old and this is a great starter tablet. He is gonna be so excited Christmas morning.
Echo does exactly as advertised. It will tell you the weather, jokes and some fun facts. using the skills you can add different features and for the most part they work. For it to really be big it has to continue to add features that the everyday user has an interest in. If you don't get the wording just right echo will not carry out the command. in the skills set you always have to start with a common phrase to get it to understand. This could be a pain because if you forget the exact phrase it will not work. Overall a great product well made and has great potential to be the star of the home automation.
The product works great. If you need help using it just look it up on youtube
I really enjoy this product. I referred it to my daughter.
Does what you would expect for the price. Not a spectacular device but it gets the job done.
Great sounding speaker!! I purchased it as a gift.
Alexa and I are best friends. She plays music, tells jokes, reminds of my shopping list, and on and on..... She's great!
The apps are better, it charges faster and the camera is really neat!
She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.
My 8 year old son saved up his allowance money in order to buy this tablet. He did all of the research himself and decided that based on the price and the features that this was the tablet for him. He can connect to our home Wi Fi to access the internet, You Tube and games. We monitor what he is accessing for safety purposes. This is much smaller than an iPad, but is very mobile and easy for kids to use. I bought a case for it to protect it from drops and allows my son to work from multiple angles on the tablet.
I purchased this for my cousin as a Christmas gift and she just loved it. I couldn't believe that a $39 tablet could do so much.
Bought this for my step sons. They positively love it and it is so easy to navigate. The only draw back is with the capability for them to download games the memory is close to full
I bought this tablet because of the price and the specs seemed fine but it is slow it freezes and crashes I dont think it was a good buy
Best Buy had a sale on the FireTV and I jumped at it. I was most interested in the speed increase over our FireTV Stick. I have been very pleased with the upgrade. I like having a microphone on the remote to do voice searches... or now Alexa commands ("turn on the lights", "trigger" IFTTT scripts). The speed over launching a navigate apps is much improved (we have been using PS Vue a good bit).Very pleased :)
Its cool for kids and safe with the case if your kid dropped
I purchased this as a after thought. The tablet has 8gb but from the moment you start to use it almost five is already used by Amazon I was totally disappointed. I love how the screen savers changed though it was so clear and unique but the memory took the cake for me!
Numerous charges of iPhone 6 at 20 degrees or less and still had 3 bars remaining
This is a great step up from the ATV which I had 3
I love that there is a kids profile you can create on the tablet. Very user friendly.
Love the tablet, just wish they had included a booklet with it and not just an on line referral. Since this is not my first tablet I was familiar with things, but for a new user, I think a booklet of some sort would be a help
Good reader to carry along for travels. I also bought a protective case from amazon which automatically shut down when closing the case. I only charged once during my 10 day travel.
Overall, I am very impressed with the Amazon Tap. The sound quality isn't the best out there, but the portability makes up for this. The volume is decent as well. There were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays, but for the past month it has been flawless. Very satisfied with purchase.
I purchased it to read books and I love the fact that I can play games on it also. Works fine and is easy to use and for the price I do not think you can go wrong.
Easy to use! Reading clarity and background light/color is perfect. Lot's of free books to download and lot's of categories to choose from. You can also sample books that you would like to purchase..
Brought for all 3 of my kids. Love this product. Tablets are easy to operate and have not had any issues with them. Well worth the $40!
My mother loves the Kendal it was one that was rep
Holds a charge, easy to use, all in all great tablet.
I had the fire stick and the fire Tv is so much better.
Echo can do many things. It can play your songs, answer questions, serve as an alarm clock, etc. It listens constantly and responds immediately. When I forget a spelling, Echo can tell you how.
The echo was easy to set up and interface with all my smart lights and outlets. It's quicker to get the weather through the echo than it is to go on line for it. It does an amazing job in understanding what I am asking for and finding the answer.
Easy setup.Easily connected to our homes Harmony setup. Gave us a reason to get Phillip Hues lights and could not be happier. Alexa works great "most" of the time. Found location is key, especially when playing tv. (Alexa can sometimes not gear our voice due to location too close to speakers) moved and works better. Always getting better.... echo can now call (soon video with another device) any echo products... (only Amazon to Amazon, for now, no cell phones)
Recommended by staff member when I asked for help. Love the size and ease of use. Just what I was looking for.
Love it, get lots of programs. This was referred to me by a friend of mine as highly recommended.
I got this for my daughter and we're both happy with the quality
Tablet works well and has all the functionality needed. Great Christmas deal.
5 star in everything..Close your eyes and just buy it
I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere.
Love all the options with the Fire TV. A lot of games and apps to help stop cable.
Like the light background. The font makes it easy to read.
Fathers day gift. Bought the Google home, could not connect to his wifi. I took it back and got this. What a pain to set up. It was the new router he bought not the Echo.He likes it so far.
I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
I wasn't sure how much I'd use the echo but I found that I use it for music, checking the weather and even cooking tips.
Bought this for my husband and he loves it, so easy for him to get information, he's not one for computers and this is a magnificent substitute for his needs.
Just wish there were instructions in the Box instead of having to go online
Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing
Excellent product at a excellent price. I like the item that I have.
20 for a USB charger is outrageous! It should have bee free with the Paperwhite Kindle.
What a great product. Fun, helpful and great sound for a speaker. I highly recommend!
It was better than I thought it would be. We use it everyday!
The ECHO was easy to set up. It also was easy to learn how to use. It was a gift for my wife and she loves it.
Tablet was purchased for a 10 yr old - it's great for him to play games on, listen to music and watch movies/YouTube. Very easy for him to figure out.
While reading might be a bit easier on the Paperwhite, navigating on it drove me nuts. The touch screen is annoying and has limited functionality. I tried to like it. I just couldn't. It's sitting unused while I use a less expensive Fire.
I guess since I'm saying that this is perfect for reading 4 stars seems cheeky. It's just that since I'm used used using a tablet which is definitely faster but at least I can read anywhere and there is no glare from the sun and it's not too bright which helps with eyestrain.
Great product, easy to use and able to get many shows and movies
This is everything the echo is but portable. You're not getting the same sound quality but more than enough for the backyard or beach. A recent update was made to give you the option of using the button or voice activated controls.
Very easy to use. Great for travel. Access to many many movies.
I bought this tablet on black Friday and went home to test it out and it was very slow and not worth the money
I love my firebox so much I bought one for a friend!!! So much awesomeness with it!!
offers a lot for the price, good parental controls
Works as advertisedSound from a small unit is very good
I would recommend it to all my family very happy with this item.
Great contrast and battery life with easy user interface.
I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad.
Just bought his a week ago. It works great in recognizing our voices and commands.
We love our Alexa! We use it for weather, news, music, games, timers, shopping lists, jokes..... My daughter got one after hearing us rave about it, and all of our grandchildren are getting a Dot for Christmas.
I love this tablet, I can take pictures and videos.
I bought 3 of these tablets. One for my dad, son and grandson and they all love it! My dad who is 76 years old and not computer lit at all said it is "pretty easy" to use (after it was set up by my son for him).
I bought this tablet for my 1 year old and he loves it! It keeps him entertained when we go places and he has learned so much. The apps are great and perfect for him. I would definitely recommend this tablet for a young child just learning to use a tablet.
It's only cost 50 dollars and it's very good for day to day usage .. the only little thing I experienced it's a bit slow sometimes..
really slow but for 25 dollars who am i to complaint, i just use it for books and my kids for games.
For the price Amazon tv is the best everything that I watch on it comes in 4K . I definitely recommend this product.
We debated on getting this because we already have an xbox one for streaming. However, this device streams seamlessly. The remote makes finding shows simple.
I brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. I basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my PC. I was nervous to try again, but am SO glad I did. The Amazon Fire $50 tablet is AWESOME for quick surfing tasks. I also use the Kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. The reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. My first issue is the Yahoo email app - for some reason I don't have access to my contacts in it! I didn't realize this at first when I was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because I had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people I wanted to send to so I could find their address to put in the TO box of the new message I was creating. What a pain! The other issue is that the app world is dominated by "for iPhone" and "for Android", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. However these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why I wanted a tablet. So if you need to do quick Internet searches/research or want to use the eReader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. Love, love, love my new Amazon Fire tablet!!!
I had a fire stick but I gave it away to a family member. I then went to purchase another one but they only had the fire tv in stock. So I reluctantly brought it but I am so much happier now that I have a tv box.
The Amazon Echo continues to advance its capabilities becoming more and more of a benefit. I mostly use it for playing music, but it has many fine uses.
My first e-reader so I cannot compare it to anything else, but this Kindle Voyage exceeded my expectations. Wonderfully clear screen, lightweight,with excellent controls. I purchased mine during a sale, but it is expensive for an e-reader. Highly recommended.
Great product for the price easy to use can download games for the kids to use as well
This tablet really help me out, as a great gift for my nephew
I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.
Very satisfied with the product, I have one for each of my kids now and for that the price point is amazing. I have a pretty big beef with best buys in store customer service at this point, I ordered a different color to help keep my kids kindles separated between them. The color I ordered for my 6 year old came in but they sent the 16 gig rather than the 8 gig. Instead of GIVING me the color my 6 year old ordered the customer service agent behind the counter absolutely INSISTED that they couldn't do that and canceled the order making me take one of the colors we already had and at least temporarily disappointing my 6 year old son who did not get the color he had wanted. Very very dissatisfied with best buy customer service on this and this insadent will make me question some of my future purchases with best buy.
I love every thing about the product and transaction, no complaints at all. I love that its affordable and does about every thing you would have need of.
Got it as a Christmas present. Recipient enjoys It very much.
Purchased for an3 year old that wanted this badly. Appears to be rugged. Links up with my amazon account for content and access. 2 year warranty. Win!!!
Far surpasses my expectations. Would definitely recommend it as a beginner tablet.
i gave the Amazon echo as a gift to my children for the holidays and from what I understand they are all loving it.
Only negative is pop-up ads. Don't quite understand the need for ads.
Just what I needed, lightweight and easy to download books from the library
I purchased this specifically to take on a cruise. It exceeded my expectations. The voyager is slim, even with the cover, it is light weight and the screen is very clear. Battery life is good. I would absolutely recommend it.
This is my first time using a media streaming device and it seems to be very easy to use. You do have to purchase some premium content, but there is a lot of free content also.
Bargain price for a fully functioning tablet. Not the fastest but certainly capable. Recommended!
My son loves his new tablet. He goes on it as soon as he gets home from school.
The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I'm enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift.
Bought the Amazon Fire tablet and love it. Beyond my expectations. Great value for the money. So happy I made the purchase.
It's okay so far.
Got it last black Friday. Was looking for a cheap decent tab. Could've been better if there was a mirroring capability.
My daughter absolutely loves this tablet! It has a lot of great apps that she can choose from in the app store too. She's had no problems with her tablet. I've even had fun using her tablet and it's simple to use.
I already have kindle 7 hdx love it. So I got this cheaper one for my son. He uses it to watch movies etc. Works great.
We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.
This is hands down the best media streaming device available today. If you have a 4k tv the box enhances the resolution any other tv the sticks will work fine.
Haven't figured it out fully yet, but can do and answer many things.
Daughter loved this as a gift. She get migraines if she were to read Ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches
Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself.
Using the unit to play games and read. Good Enjoyed using
Makes watching Netflix shows at home easy if your tv doesn't have wifi capabilities.
My 4 year old daughter loved it. Also for my 2 year old baby
I don't care for the lack of storage or the strange arrangement and naviagation through the software. Nonetheless it's nice for its price
i bought an amazon fire 7 tablet for my 7 year old granddaughter and she loves it. it is easy to operate and charge.
My Husband loved his birthday present...Alexa. He has to learn how to asked for the information correctly or you get what you actually asked her. Lots of fun information at his fingertips.
We got this tablet for our grandkids for Christmas so they would leave their parents phones alone. This way they can play all the games that they want on a device that is not quite as pricey as the smartphones. They love the tablet, but we needed to block the purchases from our grandson who is only 4, as he downloaded a game on Christmas that was not free before we could stop him. Our fault.
Purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts for my grandchildren to play games on. Excellent tablet for the price!
I like it a lot. It does what it says it will do and that's awesome.
My son absolutely loves this tablet. He has dropped it a lot and hasn't cracked it yet but even if he did amazon would replace it for up to two years for free. I also like the prime account for the kids to be able to play whatever apps for free
I can now watch all my favorite shows with Hulu and Netflix as well as all movies available with my Amazone Prime membership....
I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
Awesome product! Not a tech savvy person, Easy to use...from setup to uploading and watching my picks of movies, not disappointed in the lease. Saved me money on my cable bill too
My daughter is away at school, and she uses this inexpensive Amazon tablet, which she won't is should something happen to it, and it'll be easy to replace. It has all the functions she needs, though it doesn't support some apps, but it does support all the popular social media and has a decent camera. It's easy to use, big enough to read on, but it's not huge, and it's easy to hold, store and carry. My daughter enjoys the orange cover.
Already own one, loved it so much, bought as a gift for my mother-in-law for Christmas on Black Friday for $35! Can't beat that!
good tablet for kids, basic functionality. not much memory
Very nice little reader. Handy, convenient, easy to take along. Able to read in almost any light.
Great sounding device. Product improvements are constantly being done & more options are being added.
It is a great decent device to have around, super fast streaming without getting over heated.
Alexa is really easy to use & very convenient! We have it in the kitchen for multiple reasons, music while cooking dinner, kids helo while doing homework etc
Took some getting use to but finally got it set up and love it.
My 12yr old daughter loves it, she did not want an expensive high end tablet. This tablet is very light, very good sound and fast. The plastic screen does not feel of any less quality than a glass screen.
This device requires a little more effort to learn than one would expect. Music is better through paid music service. have to be patient to look through available apps in echo app.
So easy to read. No glare. Lightweight. Best e reader ever
i very like this item because is easy to use and fast conect
This is a vast improvment over my older model. It is easy to change print size. The fact that you can use it in the dark is a good improvment.
I bought it for my mother for Christmas and she loved it and she has not put it down since she has gotten it
before I bought this I really underestimated how much I would be using it! sounds great, it even has a good low base response and good highs and mid range.thinking of buying another for the bedroom soon.
Product is awesome. Amazing how I ask a question and in a few seconds she has the answer.
Easy to set up and use. We use her all the time to set alarms, check weather turn lights on and off, listen to music, etc. I liked it so much I bought one for my Mom and Brother for Christmas.
Good tablet for younger kids as it keeps them occupied in many ways.and great learning tool.
I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues.
I own 4 Kindles and I love them all. Purchsed the new Paperwhite because it had free 3G just wish they would make the capacity larger
No matter if full priced or on sale, this tablet is definitely worth it. Pop a microSD card in and don't look back. Paired with a Prime membership you will be able to read, shop, watch all that Amazon has to offer. I purchased a couple more as gifts after using this for a couple of weeks.
Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.
Love the fire stick! I have been recommending it to all my friends.
Very handy to know news, weather, traffic and google without opening laptop
From a fire stick to this speed difference is huge. KODI add on is a bonus.
The Amazon Fire TV is definitely one of the top media streamers on the market today. It allows for 4K playback which only a few other devices can do, ethernet port to get the most reliable streaming speed, and an expandable external storage port so you will have plenty of room for all of your apps. If you are will to pay a little extra for this it is definitely going to be worth it in the end
Alexa (Echo) is amazing. I chose the tower because of the better speaker. So glad I did. Liked it so much I bought one for my son.
I have two amazon fire sticks. They were nice but kind of slow. Got this amazon fire tv box heard it ran faster which it does but the remote dies faster... A little over 30 days of course after the return period the remote sizzled. Good thing for the remote app.
After our Insignia tablet died, I purchased two of these so my daughter and I didn't have to share. We both love it! Easy for her (9) to use for games, music, movies. Good battery life and fairly quick charging. Great value.
Echo is a great addition to the home especially since we have WeMo products in the house and able to control lights throughout the house by simply telling Alexa. Great sound in the kitchen to listen to music with Amazon's Prime music library.
My 8 year old daughter loves it. Easy to use. She watches movies, plays games, and does homework on it.
Very good buy going to purchase one for all the family members.
We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.
This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter.
For its size the speaker can still fill a pretty good sized room. We are really impressed with the sound quality. It's really cool how it can answer questions and shop for you. I also have it integrated with my Control4 system.
The Amazon Kindle is a good gift for the bookworm in your life. The lightweight and simplistic operating system allows for easy and enjoyable reading without all of the extras of a tablet. Great product for your money!!
Nice size, nice look,love the feel of turning the page. Great reading experience.
pretty much you get what you pay for... not bad, but not great, but an inexpensive fix for the cause
I am looking at the oasis and voyage but thinking they will be expensive paper weight in 3-4 years because that is the average life of kindle, this is my #4; they get slow, froze and die after 3-4 years. Moving from first gen paperwhite to the newest version, here are the noticeable changes:1. speed- this version is snappy, the new UI takes a little time to get used to.2. the LED lighting is even, no more ghost at the bottom of the page.3. cloud storage, book can be opened from the cloud and just start reading.Just like any other kindle, set up is easy, downloading over 100 titles of book to the device is fast. I do average 12-20 books a year, with the kindle of course, no worries on where to store them. Although the form factor of the oasis and voyage is very tempting but that additional price can buy lots of books!One complaint that I have is the USB cable is too short!
Don't have much storage...ok for kids. Purchase tablet as a gift but didn't last long
Great price for the kids to keep them entertain.i love the price for this item , it didn't break the bank. I would recommend this to everyone.
I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.
Great device, I have one, and purchased one for my mother. It's great for streaming things off amazon prime, but also good for downloading E-books.
Very easy setup, takes maybe 10 minutes to connect to wifi, Bluetooth and complete the setup. We don't have a lot of the smart home equipment to really utilize all the Echo's features but works really well for getting weather, news, recipes, playing games and listening to music.
Since I already own one this is for my son and his family. They love it!
You can go cheap for the regular kindle, but in my opinion its worth the extra money to get the paperwhite model. If you had both beside each other or sometimes read at night, you'd go with the paperwhite too.
Bought this reader for my mom for mother's day and she loves it
Now my bedroom TV is the smartest TV in the house. The voice command makes this a breeze to use. It hooks me up to Netflix in seconds instead of minutes like the blue-ray players on my other TV's.
I bought this as a gift for my daughter who was happy to get it.
Better then I thought, very useful and easy to use. Set up was a snap and works great
Enjoyed the firesticks for a while but was tired of how much buffering time it took because of Wifi. Spending the extra $40 to plug this directly into the modem was well worth it. Haven't had a buffering issue at all. 1080P full movies load and play in a matter of seconds!!
Great works as expected
Had a kindle before, needed new one. Like the size
A little complicated in the beginning when opening the apps but once you get the hang of it then it's easy and fast.
Amazing use for many purposes. Ask Alexa to set alarms, play pandora, and weather anytime. Well worth the money. I use it even more than I anticipated.
I have the Echo and a Dot and now the Tap, too. My only issue with the Tap is that I got it after the Echo. This means that by the time I got the Tab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Tap you have to physically get up and touch the Tap. I think if I had first started out with the Tap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Tap. But it is a habit to just call out now. So I wish I'd gotten the Tap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Try the Tap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!
Great product. I bought both the Fire TV and the Fire Stick. The stick is going back and I'm going to buy more of these for the rest of the house.
I would have to say that I've been impressed with this entry level tablet from Amazon, I personally really enjoy my Kindle HDX (which is a much higher class of tablet then this one), but for the Kids this tablet has been perfect. Good battery life, enough performance and storage for reading and entertainment and at less than $50 it has the quality that you can't find in the knock off brands at the same price point ... and when caught on sale you can sometimes even get this little e-reader for less than $40. Well worth every penny.
This item is ok,haven't really used it to the full extent need to learn more and figure out what other benefits it has to offer.
It works good.my daughter uses it to read on and play games.
good product for less price.Best deal from bestbuy
Bought this tablet for my grandson, and we couldn't be happier. He loves it, and it is easy to use. Created the children's account, so he wouldn't be distracted by all the other goings on the internet. Bought this, so he could play games, do his school work, as it links up nicely to the IXL and Google class. Love the usage timer, and the ability to lock it down. I have loaded the Google Play Store on it, so we now access to many games and other apps. No issues so far. Great buy for the money. Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far, low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all, you wont be disappointed in this purchase. Great for web page looks ups, reading and playing games.
This device is perfect for converting that "dumb" TV in your home to a "smart" one. Also, perfect for that TV that has limited apps. This comes with everything!
I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!
Love this device would definitely recommend love it
Great price. Bought thanksgiving day online. Could have picked up at store, huge supply. I got blue online, only black in store. Basic but worth the $33!
Awesome device for my six year old. Very safe useage
Upgraded from a paperwhite and the build quality of this unit is much, much better! Just it's kind of expensive for an e-reader.
Great for reading while traveling or reading in bed
I am very pleased with this product. I am able to play radio stations from across the country
Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
Best gadget to gift someone. They would just love it.
The Fire tablet is such a great value. If money is no consideration, there are better tablets out there, but for the money, this is a great choice, especially if you're a Prime member.
My son loves his own kindle! Very kid friendly and easy for him to use. It is great that he now has his own!
I started with a basic kindle four years ago After two years I purchased the kindle Fire HDX. I have been very satisfied with it. Now I also have the new kindle fire. So when one is charging I can use the other device
I bought this product for my grandmother since she has a hard time reading the small print in books. The Kindle Paperwhite has a large font setting that has made reading much easier for her and the matte screen provides for minimized glare. She can now easily read a book again!
my great grandson loves this he plays games and looks at all his pictureshe is only 2
Really enjoy using this. Great for adding groceries to a list or, with additional equipment, turning on lights. Listening to music or the news, I use this more than originally thought.
I really regret taking so long purchasing the Kindle Fire. The iPad was being so hyped up to the point that I didn't think the Kindle was as good. However, the iPad is not as good because after a few years, it no longer takes updates. What's the since in purchasing such an expensive item if it can't accept life-long updates? That was the purpose of me getting a tablet instead of a regular computer.
This product is amazing.If you are thinking of or are already transitioning to a Smart Home the Echo is a must. It turns the inconvenience of opening different apps to work your home into a one stop station that does it all.Compared to Google Home it currently has more compatible brands, which is really nice because the chances of you buying a product that is not compatible is slim.This product is much better than the Amazon Dot. The Dot is riddled with issues in addition to being less responsive and much more frustrating. I have both in my home, go with the Echo tower.
Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.
I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.
Perfect tablet for beginners. Simple to use great color and perfect size.
I am thrilled with this purchase! Both affordable and high quality!
I have no idea why someone would need to pay hundreds for a tablet when they can just get a fire.
First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. Good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus.
Great for the grandkids, they know how to manage them better than I do.
We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!
This is really helpful for everyday use. Helps with entertainment, ect. I really enjoy.. Echo
Excellent media streaming device. Could easily take the place of about 4 different boxes under your television.
I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
I caught this on the black Friday sale. Works well, way faster than the fire stick.
There are better tablets, but at this price point the Fire HD 8 is outstanding.
Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
The Amazon Fire 7 exceeded all expectations that I had for this device. It works great as an e-reader, and is a functional tablet as well. You may not get the stunning resolution of an iPad or higher priced tablet, but it certainly gets the job done when watching videos or tv shows. Amazon's app store is also better than expected. The expandable memory (micro SD card) is a huge plus for me also.
I am happy to report that the kids are happy with their gifts.
Best buy had this product when no one else did. Ok
I love my Amazon fire 7 tablet. I gave one to my grandson, and he loves it too!
This is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. If it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. My 4 year is very rough with things. My husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet, causing the charging port to break. I had no problems getting it replaced.
I am extremely satisfied with this tablet for the price I paid. It was inexpensive and it works wonderfully. I recommended it to my sister who also purchased one.
alexa is everything we expected it to be, use it daily
I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I love it! You can play games (Although a bit laggy), watch movies/TV shows, read, and do quite a bit with it! The price is amazing! I would for sure buy this again and again! I recommend this if you are wanting a tablet to read! It is a great price for a pretty big screen! (But if you are wanting more of a game tablet I would recommend an Ipad or whatever is at best buy that they recommend.) I definitely think there is enough gigs for a few games and some books! My rating is 10/10!
I bought this when I was going on a trip and figured I needed something to read on the airplane and while sitting in the sun. I am pleased that I am able to read books but also have check email and be on internet. It is like a hand held computer and I love it. Great for when traveling and I am going to enjoy reading books and drinking my morning coffee on the deck at the lake this summer. Does everything a Kindle Fire does but costs so much less.
It's a great tablet for everyone I would recommend.
I purchased this tablet for my father for the sole purpose of playing games, checking email and anything else would be very basic. He is getting chemo so has long days and often stays home so for someone not technically inclined and a beginner with tablets he loves it!!
Bought this for my son to get him reading more and he loves it.
Love my new tablet its amazing recommended it for someone whos looking for a tablet for a cheap price
i bought the amazon echo and two amazon echo doys , i have it set up in three different rooms , i use it to turn light on and off and dim the lights .to turn tv on and off ,to turn appliances on and off and i also use it for news .sports and weather updates , etc.etc.etc works with most any thing , requires certain apps for different features ,philips you for lighting , tlink to turn on and off tv wemo for small appliances these things are necessary and not expensive.good products
If you want an upgrade this product is for you. Great media streamer
A present for my wife, she says she really enjoys the larger screen.
Have you considered buying a kindle for your kids? This is the one to get. Anything else and you're over spending. Pros:Great app selectionGreat free apps due to UndergroundExtremely affordableSD card supportCons:Bad storage management - when you run out of internal space, the device stops functioning correctly!
works fine.
I had always been looking to upgrade my original Kindle. I love the new touch features and display on this one. The size also makes it very easy to transport.
Love, love, love this! Can't wait to use it on our deck this summer!
Thought this would be pretty cool gadget. Not impressed. Poor voice recognition.
This is a review for the echo itself since you can't leave a review for it yet. I received my echo March 24, 2015 and i love it! I requested an invitation for it back in the beginning of December 2014. I got an email from Amazon a month later offering me the option to purchase it in January. I am a prime member so I purchased it for 99 right after I got that email. It said it would be shipped out around the first week of April. However in March I received an email saying they were able to ship it out earlier and they did. So I waited 3 months from the time I requested it. I'm so glad I bought it back then because the price for prime members is now 149. Anyways I personally love the Echo. My 3 daughters love it more then I do. I have a 9, 6, and a 2.5 yr old and they all kno how to use it. My little one tries to say Alexa play Mimi (Minnie mouse) so she can hear the Mickey mouse clubhouse theme song. I primarily got this for my daughters. One of them is dyslexic and the other 2 are on the spectrum. So they need help with doing homework. Alexa comes in so handy for this especially with spelling. My dyslexic daughter mixes up letters so this feature helps her tremendously. Also being able to voice command Alexa to play a song at any time, really comes in handy when I'm trying to redirect my daughters, when they are having a melt down. My youngest is obsessed with Mickey so if I say Alexa play hot dog, my 2 yr old will freeze and change her focus to the music. So for these features make me happy! Also the music plays very clear and loud in my opinion. I didn't have any problems with the app until today. It did seem off today. However they are always updating things so I don't know if that's what caused it to be different.Read more
I love that the Echo responds well to anything I say. Weather, traffic, sports are all easy to ask for. I can't wait to begin hooking up my lights and other home electronics to it.
Nice to have a charger that works quickly.
Though it's entry level tablet it's not cheap technology. Amazon ecosystem is very competitive with Google and they're ahead with more rapid product line. Fire tablet is the proof of that. You can also get advantage of Alexa.
Great products from amazon Fire tv 1080p quality
Everything is ok with it. It is my first tablet but it seems adaquate.
Easy to set up and lots of fun to use. Gives good info.
Its a great technology to have at home for news and entertainment
a must have item. it is good for reading e books..
I got this tablet for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it
I love this product. I only with she would understand me a litle better.
It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
The fianc wanted one because she's a heavy reader and it's easy, convenient and portable. Was a only 40$, probably the best money I spent too make her happier.
I had a older version of this product the new version is far superior and a pleasure to use compared to the old one
The Amazon Fire works terrific! It great for emailing, social networking and web browsing. I can even play a few games on it too. Battery life is really great too. I recommend this to everyone!
The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
Bought this for 4 year old to watch Netflix and movies via Google Play.The entire user experience is Amazon-centric. The OS appears to be Android-based but is repackaged/rebuilt as FireOS. As a result this device does NOT have an Android OS user-interface.I was able to install the NetFlix app but I did not test it. You cannot load the Google Play app, which means that all the kid's movies (i.e. Toy Story, etc) that we intended to play are not available. For this reason alone the device is getting returned today.
Works just fine for my Fire 7.
Great product bought it for my youngest daughter and she loves it. Would recommend to anyone.
I love my echo. I use it all the time from timer to music. Games are fun grandkids love it also. Great for helping keeping the brain working with some of the games water sound help me fall asleep faster. I got the dot to use in the bed room for water sounds alarm and music. Learn something new all the time with my echo.
I'am having a lot of fun with the Amozon echo there is so much to learn i get email letting me know what she has learned and up dates The sound was really amazing for something so small
So it is working great. She loves the learning games
Kids love it. Everything in one tablet for kids to do. Kid friendly.....
The Fire TV is great for Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime streaming! Fast OS, great remote and has Alexa integration.
The product is great for playing music and placing Amazon orders. However, requests for information receive answers that are very short on facts.
I am an "old" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be.
purchased this to supplement my larger tablet perfect size for smaller bag.
Great product!!!! Would totally recommend it to anyone!!!
My son is having a blast basic screen but very versatile
Great value for the price. Gave them as a gift to my in-laws. They enjoy using them. Reliable name and product.
It was really a good idea to buy it during summer. Kids had great time in between other summer activities.
I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals
It doesn't always know what you are saying but for the most part it picks it up pretty well. I hope it gets better with time for the amount of things you can ask it to do, but for now it is totally worth it!
Easy to set up and easy to use. The description is exactly what you get. I love this product for all its content.
My previous Kindle did not have the backlight so I upgraded to the Paperwhite in order to be able to read wherever I happened to be.
I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8" instead of 10". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!
Chose this over a regular Bluetooth speaker and am so glad I did. Alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done. The sound quality is great. I've used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam.
Tablet works will with Amazon video on our smart tvs as well as the firesticks.
Very nice gadget for Kindle users. The 7" display is apt for reading
Works great for my 6 year old grandson! he loves it.
I use it mainly for streaming music and it is easy to connect to Pandora, iHeart, and my music library. I would like it to connect to my garage door opener and stream to other speakers in the house.
Easy to use, simple interface and the right size for quick and easy web surfing and movie watching
My Nephew and mom loved their tablets! He is 6 and takes it everywhere. Easy to set up and use
I purchased the fire 7 almost one year ago. It is a very good tablet for the money. Screen resolution isn't the best but is adequate. But at this price point I am not complaining. WiFi seems to have slowed a bit since when it was new and I dont have many apps and I do clear the background tasks. That being said it is faster than my previous fire HD 2012 generation. Cameras are so so but I don't use them often if at all. Having the micro SD slot is great. Amazon does a great job of automatically up dating the OS. I just received the Alexa update yesterday. Pick this tablet up on Black Friday oor an even better deal!
This tablet was a gift for my mothers she is not into tech stuff she found it very user friendly and easy to navigate
This tablet is great for the everyday reader and gamer , I promise it will not dissapoint.
What else can I say. This is a must have device for anyone willing to dump cable TV.
I brought this for my wife for Valentine's Day. She loves it. She can now read at night in bed with the lights out.
handy size and works well for what it is. would be a 5 if google play store. (but it is available)
Have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well.
It's fast, n I love the expandable memory slot, I love how my tv remote can control it also deff worth buying
I picked up two of these for the twins and they love em' I have to take them away from them sometimes, schoolwork has to come first ! Great tablet gave it 5 STARS, and at 50 bucks you cant beat it !
Love my watch bumper, but the tablet is so slow wouldn't recommend
I own a larger Kindle but find it hard to just throw in my purse or travel with. This was a great price & perfect size. My granddaughter even got to use it to watch Netflix on while confined to bed after surgery. Very pleased with my purchase.
My granddaughter loves her tablet. Especially the camera! As soon as her homework is done, she gets her tablet out. I am so glad I bought it!
Easy and simple for my grandson to use. Has no problem using it.
Great light weight tablet that uploads quickly. Would recommend.
Love it! I didn't think I would use it but it turns out I use it all the time!
Is great has a kids zone on it won't let them buy unless parents ok it.
The echo is great. It can run smart home products and play music.
Family is using and loving the Tap more every day. Great to find out quick information like weather, general questions and sports scores. The battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two-three days depending on usage and we use it. Excellent wifi connectivity and seamless Bluetooth connection. Use it all over the house.
I've been using it for a while and can say that watching 4k streaming movies and shows are awesome.
I read a lot...enjoy this product while reading before bedtime.
When I just want to read, the Kindle Paperwhite is everything I need. It does not strain my eyes, so I can read longer if I want. The front lit screen is perfect in dim light. It is small, so I can take it with me easily. I send documents to it regularly and I prefer reading it than anything else!
Control many aspects of your home with your voice. Links not only to amazon and your prime account but many other devices.
Perfect starter item for kids learning electronics.
I absolutely LOVE the Kindle Paperwhite. The battery life is great - reading a half hour to an hour a day it lasts 2-3 weeks. Screen backlight is very easy on the eyes and adjustable in brightness. This is one of my best tech purchases.
Echo has a better than expected speaker that plays music well. Hook it up to spotify through the alexa app and tell it what you want to hear.
Great kindle for my needs, it is easy to use and comfortable.
The echo is a fun device the entire family can enjoy.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it
The best Kindle I have ever used. It does everything.
More confusing. It would be nice to have a manual that is not online.
I like it.
Best thing that I purchased in a while. I love it.
My first e-reader, and I have been filling it up fast. Great for travel!
This is the second unit placed in my home. You will be a little withdrawn at first but once you get answers from the unit, you will love it. I recommend you use the training to your voice when you first set the unit up. Do not hesitate to learn what the Echo can do.
Amazon Tap is awesome! Very happy with the purchase!
I have bought this kindle for almost one month, and almost use it every night. It's comfortable for your eyes. I like it.
My son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with.
I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.
I absolutely love my Amazon Echo, highly recommend.
While there is absolutely nothing wrong with this item, the kids get more fun from it than I do. It is extremely impressive with its prompt responses and info.
I got an 8" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift.
I'm very happy with my purchase. I bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers.
Awesome little machine...kids talk to it everyday five times a day!!
We enjoy looking at movies and other shows on our New toy.
The Kindle works great for reading outdoors while enjoying the summer weather. My wife loves that font size can be increased so she doesn't need her reading glasses. The kindle automatically adjusts to light. Weather inside or out the Kindle is always easy to read. Opens books right where you left off, regardless of the number of books you read at one time. Highly recommend.
This tablet was amazing I love that I can add memory with a memory card.
Bought this for my 10 year old nephew for Christmas. He uses it for kid games (not true gaming). Parental restrictions/blocks work well. He seems to love it. I think this is a perfect "first" tablet or nice tablet for an adult not needing all the bells and whistles of a more expensive one. It is smaller and easily carried so it is perfect for web surfing, reading books, and simple games. At this price point, I think it was a great purchase.
This product is worth the price. Apple TV may have better features and can link to your laptop and phone, but for the price, Amazon Fire TV is great!
Bought this for my kids, the parental controls are awesome. The tab does everything it is supposed to very well, I even find myself using it after kids fall asleep. Would strongly recommend to any one looking on a budget.
Perfect for on the go use, especially when your charging your phone. Wonderful product! Very impressed!
I had to pick this up, for the deal of the day, when I saw it.
It is good for kids. Biggest drawback is the battery life. It doesn't seem to last as long. I wouldn't buy it for general day to day use or for anything more than playing games etc. Get the HD for those reasons.
Bought two of these for my kids for Christmas. Love the level of control it gives me to supervise and monitor usage.
This item is perfect for children and great for parents. It provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it.
It's really cool. Who knew I would get such a cool thing in just 35 bucks? Impressive.
gave my dad my kindle two years ago and at xmas time i loved the price and upgrades of camara and sd card
I love my echo! Great product, still learning new things about it everyday!
No disappointment for this Amazon Echo!Great product!
I received this as a Christmas gift. I was excited about this new product and downloaded the Alexa App. I am not an Amazon Prime member and I did not joined the free trial. I asked questions to my Alexa and it usually did not provide any answers, or couldn't understand my questions despite giving simple commands. The device looks good and the LED light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great. Sound is good for music. However, I did not feel that it was a good assistant. I did not like that you have to download skills to make Alexa have more function. You always had to speak Alexa, and then ask the skill you downloaded. It then gets to a point that you don't even remember what skills you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had. I exchanged it for the Google Home and it has been a better device. It plays music from Google Music and not only music that you have purchased. It answer a lot of questions and gives you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skills. It also provides more answers to questions and I was surprise by the detail of the answer at time. I highly recommend to Google Home device. I have not tested it with chromecast, Smart TV, or with Smart home appliances such as Nest, etc.
The tablet is great! Easy to use, better than the Galaxy that I have.
Bought kindle for a gift as the one my daughter had 5 years ago starting not to work right. She loves this rader and got good reviews about it.
Once you learn how to use it, it is fun to have. This is a bunch of junk that you have to enter so many characters to make this right.
I purchased this for an 11 year old. This was more than enough for his games and videos.
WE RE ENJOYING ALEXA AND HER ESOTERIC RESPONSES VERY MUCH.
It's ok. It does not have all the apps you might be looking for.
Excellent price point for feature rich product. The screen is clear & sound is passable. I would recommend this product as a great buy.
This is the 4th kindle I've purchased, not because of issues but because everyone in my house wants one. This last one I purchased for my 3 year old. He is very happy he can play games like his older siblings on his own kindle now
Purchased as a gift for the mother-in-law who needed a new device for reading books. Even at the suggested retail it's a rather remarkable bargain; with Black Friday pricing it was a steal. Excellent graphics, convenient size.
Was looking for a simple tablet to use during my commute. This fits the bill. App store is limited, but this is good for simple web surfing or watching videos. Lightweight too. Only thing I don't like are the ads on the unlock screen (but, this is minor considering the price).
Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it.
I got this tablet for Christmas and only used it for one day. The next day I could not use it, it keep glitching. When I got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, I guess that is what Best Buy does. I think someone switched it out. I took it back to Best Buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be $200 to fix or call Amazon. Why would I pay $200 to fix a tablet that was $40. Amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it.
Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
Used for reading and surfing the web, this tablet is great for all. Great screen clarity.
I got this for my wife. She loves it. Very user friendly. Forever battery life.
It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy.
It was a gift for christmas. Does everything the expensive ones do
We bought this for our two year old grandchild he loves it we set up a screen name for him and he plays on it every night! He has dropped it several times and it's fine nothing at all wrong with it!! Very durable!
Bought this for my dad to watch Netflix, and it works very well. Easy to use, which is a bonus
Purchased for a grandson but everyone in the house enjoys it
My kitten chewed through the power cord that came with our Echo and I had to order a new one. I was disappointed that I had to buy another plug instead of being able to buy a replacement cable like most USB cables. I bought a cord protector for this Echo power cord so that hopefully I won't have to buy another one due to a destructive kitten.
I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product.
Very easy to setup and use.would recommend this product.
agood buy for starters, recomend to other buyers to
Fun to ask random questions, get news and weather. I also control my Phillips hue lights with it. Kind of a novelty right now but I'm looking forward to some good use I can put it to.
I bought this tablet to replace my old kindle fire. So far, it has exceeded my expectations. All my apps have transferred flawlessly. The battery lasts me 10-12 hours, with moderate internet use. Glad I made this purchase.
First kindle. Only used a few things. It was easy to set up. Now to purchase another for my daughter and see how easy to link.
The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product.
Best thing ever! Since I bought the fire stick, I hardly watch regular TV. We are thinking about cutting off our cable to save money because the fire stick gives us every show/movie we need from regular cable.
I purchased this item for my nephew and he loves it. It's small and works great. So far we have had no issues and the memory space is great.
We don't have one complaint. We are very satisfied.
I gave this to me niece as a christmas gift and it she was very happy with it.
Great gift! Would definitely recommend to family and friends
Alexa is the greatest product ever I use it around the house all of the time
Works great for watching tv shows. Plugged right in. Easy to use.
This my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal
I purchased the Echo with the dream of controlling my Ecobee Thermastat with my voice. After getting it and looking into the vast amount of "skills" you can add to it...It has become one of the purchases of the year for my household!
I Brought this item for grandsons. They love them.
love the fire tv . best buy shipping is great very fast ship.
I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price.
I already got this echo. I am a real estate agent and I love our Alexa so decided to buy them as a housewarming gift.
Works great & it doesn't freeze. Happy I bought it. Works better than the fire stick
Giving it an average rating because boo hoo, I haven't figured out how to make it work yet. It responds but doesn't seem to have answers to any of my queries or requests. It must be just a matter of connecting it to a proper wireless source. So far I haven't figured it out. I am eager to however! I guess I am just too technologically challenged.
This is a great tablet for children and really has an easy to use format. The apps work well and keep the kid entertained by not distracting them with the mechanics.
From the beginning we've had issues with our remote
Great product for those that have service from different apps and devices. Here one can access many in one device with ease of setup.
Great product for what it is designed for. Easily modified for Kodi
My grand daughter loves it, hasn't put it down since we bought it from her. Clear picture, runs great, she loves to watch videos and play music.
This is a great easy little computer to have if you just want something to access the internet that doesn't require a phone contract. We are using it to run training videos off our training website so we can do shoulder to shoulder training. Works out great for that.
By far the best media box out there . Absolutely no complaints . Does it intended job with an easy interface
I recommend this tablet for beginners it definitely does the job needed to keep little ones entertained.Worth the money great price
I love this tablet and it is very nice and reliable and would highly recommend
You can't go wrong with Alexa, easy to use. I get my flash briefing news with the focus on the Economy as a breeze when I get home after work.No need to turn the TV or a radio for the upcoming Weather, just ask Alexa.
Have not received mine but have spent many hours with my friends it really is amazing great fun.
Perfect tablet for beginning reader. Great for games and videos.
I bought this for my wife for Christmas she had the original Kindle and it broke after years of use. At first she was disappointed that the screen was so small, but now that she's been using it she loves it ! Much easier to hold and flip pages !
I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. I recommend it to any parent for a child.
Not only fun but very informative in all sorts of areas
The kindle e-readers are the best on the market. While this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.
I use it everyday! I absolutely love my echo! Best Buy ever!!
The Echo is everything I thought it would be. Easy to set up, easy to use, loud, and many extra features you can link with. The timer and grocery list features are awesome. Voice commands for Pandora are cool as well.
I replaced my smart dvd player and this product works amazing and fast
I think my Aunt likes her new toy. It is Amazing how technology marches on. This unit is perfect as an introduction to the tablet for people. Even if you have other tablets this is a wonderful addition because you can take it with you as if it's a throwaway. It has the slot to expand memory and the headphone jack has plenty of power and quality sound. It supports Bluetooth audio also. Any gadget freak should add this to their collection.
Fire is a great little tablet that is easy to use. Great for reading books, checking your e-mails, doing Facebook.
Too much configuration in order to work as needed.
Its effective and responsive although it has a hard time with backgound noise and needs to be away from a wall. Works well
I love the fact that you can go on line, browse titles, make a selection and have the book immediately. No travel to a book store, no waiting for online ordered books to arrive. Kindle purchases are available immediately upon purchase... Back lighting is excellent and the ability to adjust font size is great. Holds a charge for a couple of weeks of moderate reading. Definitely a good product.
I like how easy it is to do what i need on this tablet, like downloading apps,playing games, streaming on netflix and taking pictures.
My kids love this product it keeps them busy anytime of day
This item is fair in price, and a great quality for my children! Keeps them busy while I take care of our home business.
Will recommend to friends and family, best tablet I bought
I bought it in thanksgiving.its very cheap and has got good features for that.
I liked the Fire TV so much, I purchased a second one.
It is nice product. I like the design very helpful product
How magical is it that this Alexa knows the answers to all my questions? She never seems to offer anything outside of what is asked of her, and gives only a specific response to any query I pose. Awesome.
This is my second Kindel. My first one was a Kindel fire. I liked it and I love to read so I thought I would give this one a try. I love this one more!!
Love the Tap, plays my daughter' s music. Works well if you are a Amazon Prime member.
I use this for facebook , checking email, and streaming Pandora while in a hotel. Don't ask a lot from this because at the end of the day it's still a $50 tablet. Battery life is really good, however it's really finicky about the power cord while charging. The biggest complaint I have is it wants a credit card even for free apps such as facebook and youtube. However you can work around by getting them on your desktop and having them sent to your device. Overall extremely satisfied.
The Amazon Echo does & is doing what it's supposed too. Works great
It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. So convenient. Love this!
as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized.
Very Good Tablet, I bough one for every one of my kids, also I gave one to my friend on his Birthday, is pretty fast and also you can install a MircoSD card in order to increase the capacity to download more games & applications.
The price is great the feel of it in ur hands don't feel cheap
she loves it and uses it. easy to adjust type size, she is computer illiterate and needs help loading books
The paper white kindle is great. Makes reading in the dark is so much easier.
We love the echo for music if you have Amazon Prime. Just ask her to play a song, artist, or even genre and she does. We also love using her for timers, reminders, and to create grocery lists.
I use it a lot everyday to control my lights (with TP-LINK bulbs)Setup was extremely easy. it understands me better than Siri
Brought reading inside, outside in the bright sunlight and even bedtime reading back into view! Great product and a must have !
Nothing is perfect (even IPad). But for what you can do with this product for this price it is real excellent. Have more than one. One for work and one for home.
Bought this on Black Friday and have not looked back! Love it
My husband is an avid reader and what better way to reward him for his love of reading(and playing games lol)
It's great if you don't download a lot of books. Storage is filled quickly
Now own echo DOT, Echo TAP and the ECHO. Recommend all highly
I haven't had my Fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. I've downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. Not my way to watch movies or TV but the screen is nice. Very clear and sharp. Audio is just OK from the speakers, you'll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. I really like the Fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money.
Fun and interesting but will be better as the apps and software available for this item are more advanced/available.
I purchased this tablet as a gift for my mother. It doesn't have the drills of some other tablets, but it meets the basic needs she was looking for.
This was well received. A wonderful upgrade from a first gen Kindle.
Bought one for myself and my younger sister. If you don't want or NEED to spend a couple hundred on an Ipad or something like that, This is a really good deal. I enjoy using it a lot, and so does my younger sister. Doesn't have all the fancy things the more expensive ones do, but it's not bad for the price.
Absolutely love the Amazon Echo! I work from my home office quite often and have my Echo sitting on the desk next to me. From playing music, searching for a number or address, checking the weather or asking a quick question... it's like having a co-worker/personal assistant by my side. The big difference is I can get what I need quickly and eliminate the need for unproductive small talk.
This Fire is a bit smaller than my Kindle Fire from a few years back. I still seems to have all the features and is 1/2 the price.
Super cool tablet for daily use. Freezes here and there, but nothing a reset wont fix.
I have several smart devices and light bulbs. I love using my Amazon Echo to control different devices.
Pretty good system. Can't wait for the upgrades. Sound is superb
I bought this for a Christmas gift. They love it! Very happy with purchase.
the tablet is very helpful when using the internet
My kids love them very good and they enjoy playing there game and music
Gave this as a gift. My friend liked the tablet and it is pretty inexpensive. The only problem is that flixster app is no longer available/compatible with Amazon so, she is not able to watch movies she owns on flixster.
Broke away from cable and Direct tv and all there fees and high prices. Got the fire TV to do this.
For the money, you really can't do much better in the tablet department. Quick, responsive and does everything you want it to do. Highly recommended
It's the best price media streaming tablet on the market. I watch everything on it.
I love the convenience of using Alexa for anything from a timer to answering questions. Being able to get music on voice command is great as well, as I can pause and resume without grabbing my phone or a remote all the time. I would highly an Echo to anyone interested.
Bought this one for our white kitchen. Blends in well and is very handy both in the morning and at dinner time. New features added weekly.
This is probably the most used device in our home besides our phones. We use our fire tv daily, whether we are listening to music. Catching up on our favorite shows, or even watching a movie. I love the voice activated feature, it's nice to check the weather, movies playing at the local theatre, or look up you favorite artists.
Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
I bought this for my mom. It works perfectly for Facebook, games and email.
Bought as gift for mom and she loves it and uses all the time! It was simple to set up also.
Got it at a very good price, and it did not disappoint me. Mainly used by my kids, I can set up and control exactly what they can view, read and play. Each one has his own user, so they can personalize their experience with it as well. Works well, does the job, and again, at a very good price.
I love my Alexa! It was easy to set up and begin using. The kids love her , too? They like playing word games with her. I use it for music and for the different lists I have. She reminds me and sets alarms for me. I highly recommend Alexa. I just wish the accessories like the light bulbs and others were not so expensive.
I was searching on Amazon for the Kindle 7 but it was out of stock until AFTER Christmas. Went to Best Buy and found they had more than enough in stock. Got one for my daughter who loves it. Thanks!
Works great and exactly as a tablet should. Awesome price at Best Buy! Keep in mind there are certain apps that aren't compatible with Amazon, so check it out beforehand at the store, but if you can DO without those apps then its perfect for anyone .
Having had several models of Kindle readers, I can say that this is the best yet and is definitely worth the extra cost.
I purchased this Kindle to replace my original Kindle that is of the same format. I don't believe it was called Paperwhite, but its the one without the keyboard at the bottom. It has been a great Kindle, however, I've always been disappointed that it did not have a back light. Now that I have a back light, I have no idea how I managed before. Even reading before bed with the lamp next to the bed on, the back light makes a big difference. The extra resolution is nice, but not really a huge thing when you're talking about text on the screen. The battery life is definitely reduced when running the back light, however, not to the point where I have to charge every night. I'll still likely get several weeks of battery life before needing to recharge. Overall, if you're looking to upgrade, this is the Kindle to get. The back light is a huge upgrade for me. It helps reduce my eye strain which is important to me.
The Amazon echo was a easy setup. The sound was great and is worth the cost.
I love it because it saves me money. Easy to use. Great value.
I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to!
Works great. Battery starting to lower easier about 8 months into purchasing
We are very happy with this tablet. It is much better then the RCA
Easy enough for a 5 year old to use and with the chip added he can add games to his tablet
Don't support google.. My son could not view his grade.
I would like this product a lot more if it came with a remote control that is not as small as the original
Great product. Exactly what we thought. Ordered online and came quickly.
Easy to install and use. Great for streaming movies and getting Amazon movies.
I bought this hoping to get a responsive android streamer, but was disappointed with the performance and the "4k" that was somewhat limited. I decided to return this and get an Nvidia Shield, which offers more value, instead.
Happy with purchase at sale price. Wouldn't have bought at full price.
great for listening to prime music, quick weather reports. volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request.
Best small tablet for the money. Good resolution for a small tablet. Does everything I expected and more.
I bought this tablet to watch my recorded TV shows while I am at quilt retreats. I also can watch Netflix and Amazon prime. I like that is takes a micro SD card!! Picture and sound are very good!
If you are thinking about cutting the cord to cable TV or getting rid of satellite TV, this is the way to go. As long as you have an Intenet connection, this device can give you anything you can think of to watch. Great product!
Convenient and way to use. First tablet for me. Very happy.
Easy to find different apps on the Amazon fire box.
Made life so much easy... reads news, weather, time, shopping list, to do list.. without us having to look at phones... awesome product
It's a great tablet for the price. Gift for my grandson..
Like system for live sports, movies ,TV shows and kids shows..
I bought this as a gift for my wife who loves reading. She has really enjoyed being able to. Andy this sleek reader in her purse when she's on the go.
well design and perfect size to carry along. What it does is to give you a quick access to e book and provide a better experience compared to view of phones
I love my new Amazon Fire tablet. Easy to use and great for all levels
I really like the echo for controlling my hue lights. Sometimes it will do stuff with out even saying alexa though other than that decent product
I bought this as a gift for my smart 1 yr old niece and she loves it. she is always using the tablet. it's her favorite toy.
Items is very easy and a noob friendly. I love the item.
Allows me to decide if I want to stop using TV providers
best kindle so far.much slimmer profile. Battery last much longer and it doesn't seem to have the charging issues my other 3 had
This was a Christmas gift andmy son is pleased with it!
Great for smaller kids who are Too young to play or get a turn to play on Xbox games with 7 siblings
The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand and lighting is noticeably improved
Best electronic reader. The base kindle is hard to read because the lack of light and the other readers and apps just don't offer the quality experience and feel of the kindle paperwhite.
Surprised my son-in-law with the Echo. Such a great gift for everyone who loves gadgets and technology.
Love how I can continue to read outside in the sun
Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
Brought it as a Christmas gift and then I fell in love with it after setting it up. small and simple.
My son and I both love the Amazon fire! He's 8 and plays his games and downloads books. I download books and watch movies and shows
This is the best gift anyone could receive, talks to you, wakes you up, sings you to sleep, turns lights off. I love this thing!
I love the learning games that he doesn't even realize they are learning games
This tablet is fantastic. It's small yet biiger than my iPhone. It works fast and I've had no problems with it so far. Plus for the price, you can't go wrong with it. It's more than half the price of a Samsung or iPad yet works just the same. Don't hesitate to buy this
loved it, it is exactly what I needed for my granddaughter she can play unlimited games
Get your weather forecast first thing in the morning, review your to do list, check your appointments for the day all while having your morning coffee. Great way to start your day.
Bought this for my dad and he loves it. He does not do anything too extreme just basic apps. And it handles multiple apps well and for only $50 it was a great value deal. Excellent for games and light activities.
Great tablet, for kids and adults. Love it, it's my backup for paying bills etc.
I got this to use while I travel because you can connect to Wi-Fi that has a webpage for signing in, like pretty much all hotels require. It was awesome for about two weeks. At first it worked fine with my brand new awesome Samsung 4k tv, then a week later the tv didn't even recognize it. Apparently it doesn't pay nice with Samsung. Not a huge deal since I bought it for traveling, then it didn't display correctly on the hotel tv, it was just a tiny piece of the picture and it was jammed into the top corner and the rest black. The next hotel, it looked fine but there wasn't any audio. COME ON. Really stinks.
Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet.
This is used in a work environment. Our tech support team chose this particular tablet for all of us. We use it for contacts, work trail record keeping, and customer support, and are very pleased with how much we can do with it. I say, excellent choice.
Great product for price. Holds its own against many in Higher price range. Love it...
Bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter. She loved it. Easy to use and excellent display. I am considering one for myself now that I've seen and used hers. Very light also.
I can watch a ton of shows now with this. Well worth the money
This box has a ton of apps and features on it as it comes... and it gets even better once you install KODI!
We 2 Amazon Fire's for our kids for Christmas. We chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads. Since having them, they have been decent, but not great. The kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens don't always appear; sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded, the pad acts like it needs to re-download the game; and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads. Turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. When they do work properly though, the kids love them. They are decent for a 1st time pad for kids for not a lot of money, but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times.
I like it. It's better than the Apple mini. Plenty of apps.
Great and alexia can control my Philip hue lights !
Purchased as a gift for my husband. He is not a tech person, I was afraid he would be intimidated but he loves it.
Absolutely best amazon product ever! Very easy to navigate. Love everything about it.
I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp.
Bought for grandkids. They loved it and I'd recommend it to everyone.
This kindle fire 5th generation 7inches is a very good product.it works well.and best buy customer service was so helpful.
First of all you cant beat the price. I got it for my 4yr old granddaughter and it serves its purpose well. Its perfect for her to play games on or watch you tube vidios. Its size makes it easy to take it with us almost everywhere because it fits rite in my purse.
amazon fire tv is on fire... this is the best stream device now in day.i will highly recommended. the speed is amazing. all you need is a good internet service to enjoy it's maximum potential.and if you have a prime account in amazon you get to enjoy many movies and tv series. get this device for your home
It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive.
Price is low, but OS is lacking unlike other brands it doesnt come with a decent charger. To refill battery you have to charge it overnight.
Great love that I can monitor the time used in certain things
I wish it had 3G or 4G. Other than that it is great.
This is my second fire I used last one all the time between grandkids and myself time to pass the old one down for them to use.
Very happy with my purchase, totally recommend this product.
Awesome system, easy to use, love it! Waiting for the next system to upgrade on my room.
This device streams available content smoothly. Plan to buy another one for children.
This has been a fun and intuitive way to play music, get the weather report, find out game scores, etc. I'm looking forward to integrating it into my house with lighting and temperature control. The speaker sound quality is excellent for such a small machine.
The Amazon Firebox process a lot faster then the fire stick. Both product is good. I connect the box to my router and it zip to Netflix in a zap.
I love my new kindle! I can read books, read email, shop online and play games!
I would recommend this tablet to everyone that wants a tablet. It is real easy to play games, Facebook and google.
I m hoping that it doesn't have the same battery port charging issues that the first generation had.
Overall good tablet for kids. My 6 and 3 year olds both enjoy it. Battery doesn't last anywhere near 7 hours though.
This product is the best item HANDS DOWN! Love IT!
I had a previous model, one with buttons around the case, not the screen itself. The screen on the one I purchased is brighter, slightly clearer, and the touch screen is far easier to navigate. Well worth purchase price if you want to read without the bulk of a book. Different fonts and word spacing is great, something that will never be available on book. I gave the nook a try but did not like it, the back light was terrible.
great table for kids and parents control great gre
Purchased as a gift for 6yr old boy. He can now play all the games he wants without having to share with big brothers!!
I got this because I saw it on Amazon.com. I the. Went to BB just to see if they had it in stock. I fooled with the demo for about a minute and decided it was good enough to spend the $50 on. If I didn't want it I could give it to my mom or something. This thing has really impressed me. I have an iPad and an iPhone 6s. The kindle isn't near the performance of those guys but I was looking to step outside my ecosystem and just get a feel for something new. Besides, Amazon can do no wrong. Bottom line is that it's a greater starter tablet...something to have on the nightstand and let the company use.
Only problem is when you go to the next page, it sometimes goes 10 pages at a time.
I mainly use my Kindle strictly for book reading. It's the second one I've owned. The first one I had for several years but quit taking a charge. The device is easy to use and has good battery life.
I find this product to be great on plane rides due to extended battery life and great section of reading material
I've had this tablet for several months now and have had no problems with it. 8 in screen is perfect easy to hold, not too big or too small. 16GB ROM(about 12gb available after updates and built in apps) is good if you don't have a lot of apps or games. The RAM could be bigger but it doesn't lag even with some medium gaming. 1.5ghz processor is not for heavy gaming, but for everyday use is great. The battery life is excellent I would say easily 8 hours or 5 to 6 if gaming. While this is not a HD display the colors are sharp, some glare if in the sun. Camera sucks but decent for the price, no issues connecting and syncing my data to my Amazon account. If you are an Amazon Prime member definitely buy this tablet and even if you aren't this tablet gives you a lot for the price. I wish Amazon would offer more than 90 day warranty but overall very impressed and satisfied with my purchase.
I purchased this tablet for my young nephew to watch videos on the go. It was to replace his iPad mini. This tablet does everything that he was doing on the iPad, is easy to use, and only a fraction of the cost. The advertising on it is a bit annoying, but can not complain with the price.
turns out this was not necessary ... being returned.
Answers just about any question, spells words, plays a boat load of songs although some songs require additional membership. Love it and would suggest to all
Bought two of these tablets for my stepson and mother-in-law for Christmas. Not bad items for the price. Basic tablets,basic features, nothing special about them. They use them for connecting to the internet, playing games and watching movies. This tablet does this well on wi-fi. I expect them to perform well for the next couple of months.
Great product, easy to use and readAnd the warranty taken makes it worry free
I recommend this product many movies and very clear.
Debated to get Google instead but since we have a Prime subscription it made more sense to go with the Echo. Hope to soon control thermostats and lights.
I got the Amazon Echo for my SIL for a Christmas gift and everyone in the family was jealous. They all want one! Purchasing it at Best Buy was easy and the best way to go since this was a popular item this year.
I compared it with google home. Amazon echo has a lot of effort in it already, but google home has much greater potential when they update it over the next few years. Overall echo is a very good product.
This is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids I reccomend big time.
This reader has everything I wanted except the ability to download books directly. It is extremely easy to read and a perfect size for transport
My Amazon Kindle Paperwhite B00OQVZDJM, which features a 6 300 ppi Carta ePaper antiglare touch screen with optimized fonts. The built-in backlight makes it simple to read at night.
if you want to have multiple apps this is what to get
Bought this on black Fri. Great tablet for the price.
The person who received this tablet is very happy she received this gift!. She loves having it.
it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price
This Amazon Fire TV box works as advertised. It was a breeze to set up and took me about five minutes to figure out how to use the features and functions.
I bought this for my grandkids. It is easy to use and they Love it.
Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
I love the fire tv. I already had the fire stick and decided to give this a try for the living room. I'm very happy with it. Love the fact that I can hook it up through LAN so I doesn't buffer anywhere near as much as the stick
I didn't actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles.
Nit sure was s gift not sure what the product is like
I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday. Her sister already had one and the family thought it was a great tablet.
Got this for my wife. Uses it everyday and performs great regardless of where your reading just like it's suppose to
If you have an Amazon Echo already then you know what a great gadget it is. This is Echo in baby size and portable. The newer version can be "woken up" with your voice like its big sister or you can program it to only respond when you push the mike button. It had all the features of Echo and excellent sound for its size. I have it in the bedroom and use it as an alarm and music when I get dressed. All in all a great item for the price.
for 50 this one of the better tablets you can get as its fairly fast and has a solid display.
Love to ask Alexa questions. Easiest alarm to set. Has so many uses that are easy to learn.
I saw Echo at my cousin's one day and by the next I had one! There was a short learning curve but we (The Echo and I) achieved it!
For years I have used my very basic Kindle e-reader, but had difficulty in dim lighting. I am thrilled with the backlit screen on my new Kindle Paperwhite.
I would recommend this tablet because of the value
It's perfect for me when I'm doing homework or just surfing the web when I'm at a Starbucks or just at home.
Love this tablet bought this for my granddaughter she enjoys it and plays with it daily
Got tablet for my daughter, very happy with product features. Easy to navigate and my daughter loves it.
My kids were very excited to open this e-reader on Christmas morning. They both started looking up books etc. Very easy to use, small enough to stick in your purse/bag but big enough to read like a book. Very happy with this purchase.
whats to say.................................................it's Kindlelishous!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A great tablet for my son. It has YouTube and parental controls as well as time limits.
Very Fast, Excellent Quality. The most I like is Alexa! You can ask whatever you want and she will respond
This tablet cannot be beat for the price we paid. Just wish I would have purchased one that was bigger.
Heard about this from a friend. Best Buy answered all my questions. Enjoy the product
I vacation often and enjoy reading on the Kindle verses my tablets.
I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7" Fire better than on top like this new 8". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.
Bought this to lay on the coffee table for quick email checks and google searches. If you are looking for something to watch movies on or simple tasks, then it will do ok. Not a daily driver for sure.
Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
This product is easy to use for people that aren't to good with very high tech stuff. My mother likes it.
The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
Purchase tablet for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas. She has enjoyed it every since opening it.
Best Buy always has the lowest competitive pricing and great availability
Was trying to decide between the voyage and this model. No regrets whatsoever on going with the Paperwhite!
It's a great item I can hands free use. The best is when I need to add something to a shopping list. I can ask her and not worry about finding paper I may/will loose
It works.
The Amazon Echo is everything it is advertised to bed. The voice recognition is very good - it understands commands from every family member, even when our speech patterns are very different. The variety of skills is impressive. We have been using our Echo for a month, and have only begun to unlock its capability.
This is a great budget tablet. Don't expect it to compare to an iPad, but it's great for the kids!
Great device. Great for reading books. Small and compact. Lightweight. Looks great too. The light is a great feature
My 8 year old is required to read for 20 minutes a day for school. Something about reading on an electronic device excites and he is willing to read without a fight. Great purchase for us.
this is the best ereader in the market, the battery last a least 4+ weeks with one charged
You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.
I have bought 5 kindles over the last several years, 1 for me and the rest for gifts. Haven't had any problems with any of them.
My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.
Excellent quality. Easy to set up. Works great. Definitely recommend.
Love the lack of bells and whistles stuck in Airport battery lasts forever
I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country, and it was superb for email, online transactions like buying theatre tix, and finding and making various reservations. Also, outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod
Has media streaming capabilities but also Alexa smart home functions. Good value for the price. This version has 4K streaming capability.
I think this item is great. I got rid of my Cable.
I like to have a book in my hand when I read, but needed an electronic book reader for our overseas trip. Kindle Whitepaper was great. will you use when I am eating since there is no pages to hold down like you do with a book.
My 3 year old destroyed an iPad mini. This thing has held up through drops, throws , and sticky fingers. Awesome investment for road trips.
My kids just Love there tablets and they are Very Much worth the price.
We are having so much fun with the Echo. Alexa plays our favorite music we've saved in our libraryfinds new songs, gives us news updates and weather reports. I know she does much more but we have not had the time to experiment..The sound quality is great. After we bought ours, I bought a second one for a Christmas Gift.
Alexa is an incredible asset to our home and she even plays music for our dog when we are not at home.
Home assistant x bluetooth speaker. Alexa is awesome!
I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it!! The reviews were excellent
outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
My family and I are enjoying Alexa. Great for playing music, setting timers, adding to shopping list, etc. Still finding new and useful things to do with it.
I love my kindle. Bought this one for my mother in law. Plan on putting her on my Amazon account then we can share books. This way she will always have books to read and not have to pay for them. Luckily we like the same authors.
An awesome product. Getting my money's worth. I would truly recommend this product.
I like its flexibility, portability and it is the best value option of all three Alexas
This Amazon tap is awesome! Take Alexa outside! The sound quality is amazing and the price is right!
I have a Kindle Fire that is about four years old and does not have a camera - I bought the new one primarily because it has a camera. I am not disappointed!! The new one not only has a great camera but it is not as heavy as my old one. Also, the new one is much more user friendly. Liked it so much I bought a second one to give as a gift. A great buy!!
So having this device has been great, Amazon prime aside, (as you can watch all of the great stuff Amazon has to offer if you are a Prime member) this devices allows excellent DLNA media streaming, access to online media applications such as netflix and many music sites as well.On my Smart TV i've always had an issue with the Netflix application crashing or not being able to connect for reasons unknown, and I constantly had to reset the entire "Smart TV" to get it working again "maybe".Using Netflix via the Fire TV, has never been easier, it actually makes the picture seem even more crisp than the native netflix application on my 4K Ultra HD 3D TV, go figure. the app doesn't crash on me, and i don't even use the Netflix app on the dumb i mean smart tv i have, i go right to the fire tv.This is a must have device for all things media.
Best kindle ever, great for readings, the charger sold separately
I bought this tab for my mother. I felt it was a great Christmas gift. She was very exited to see it and actually thought to get one. I might buy one for myself.
I am not really a fan of tablets but when this one came out it had my attention... I bought it as a gift to surprise my husband with and he absolutely loves it..... love the fact that you can set the background and it's not as hard to operate like the older kindles...
Great tablet for ages 8 and under my kids love them
One of my best purchase yet. One of the cool feature is the alarm.. I tend to over sleep sometime.
I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.
Bought this for my son and daughter-in-law for Christmas. Had so much fun asking Alexa questions when we visited. Especially useful for weather forecast before heading out for a day of sightseeing!
I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.
The Fire is a basic tablet, but it's the best I've seen for $50.
Great for reading in sunlight. Lightweight and battery lasts a long time!
Save some $$ for hight price cable tv!!! This is the reason why i cancelled my cable tv
Great tablet and its price for it, it's awesome my kids love it and it keeps them entertained.
Although I did like the Roku navigation a little better, the Amazon Fire TV has given us everything we need to feel good about not having cable anymore. We started with one and have gone back to buy 2 more.
This box is the best,great apps,memory is powerful.Better than apple tv
I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
I highly recommend this product for children with special needs
I have had other devices like this. This one by far is the best. No glitches or buffering.
Love it! Have talked several people into buying one also.
Works like a Charm...
This tablet is great especially for a child. Granddaughter is responsible but accidents do happen so I didn't want to buy her an iPad till I saw how she did with this. After playing with her fire and being able to download so many free games, she informed me that she does not need an iPad. Needless to say she is very happy and so am I. I like that I could buy the smaller gb one since you can add an sd card to it, to increase the storage. This is really a great purchase.
Purchased this at a great price to use as an on the go tablet. Works great and is easy to use.
I am not highly technical and this was easy to learn how to use. It is small enough to be easy to carry. I have been able to download the few games that I play. So far, I can't find a single thing to be unhappy about!
Great for any age. Tons of apps to download. My kids stay busy for hours without the tablet dieing. I would recommend to others.
This is a great tablet for the price. You can't beat $49.00. 85% of my usage of this device is for reading my Kindle books. Yes I would recommend if you're looking for a simple tablet
I bought this reader because my Nook was hard to read in the sun. THis reader was easy to use and great for any light including sunlight.
Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member.
I bought this Amazon Fire product for me to perform a basic web search, reading, and watch video online. It is a good product; however it does not have enough space to store videos.
He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
I love Alexa. I've purchased the light/other electronics control wall plug ins and now not only can Alexa keep me company, play my music, and basically be my personal assistant but she can turn on/off my lights and electronics when I ask. Next is to purchase the thermostat. I'm sure there is more to come.
Used Kindle tablets before needed update. As sson as I started to use it liked it even more
I purchased the Amazon Echo to augment my other smart devices. Boy, has it made me lazy. Gone are the days when I'd have to stretch my arm out ALLLLLL the way to the lamp on my nightstand to turn it off. The days of pulling out my smart phone and setting my alarm for the next morning are also gone. Now, a simple "Alexa, turn off my nightstand" and "Alexa, set my alarm for 8:30am" is all I need. Even walking through my living room, I find myself saying "Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights" and "Alexa, play my favorites playlist." You see, it's addicting, and having a wireless speaker that plays music AND controls your life with simple voice commands means you end up buying two. I started with one in my living room but found that I had to yell to turn off said nightstand lamp or turn the thermostat down.... so I bought another. I have now repositioned the one in my living room so that it can hear me when I walk in from the garage, and added the one in my bedroom, which can hear me from the entry or my bathroom.Now, if only she could automate the rest of my life. Amazon is working on it though - I receive weekly emails about new things you can do with Echo.
I love this kindle! I like the fact that it has a great feature that the background is lit up. Had the originial and this one tops it.
Great product, I have Apple TV 3, and this is just as good or better.
I love this device. It is great for a device of its size,
Unbelievable sound from a single source. Now I can simply say what music I want, the volumne and timer are a great feature. She reads to me and answers most questions. She even tells worse jokes than me. This has enhanced my bleek life. I can turn on lights and TV when I couldn't before. It gives me freedom over my environment.
The product was fine. I would definitely recommended to a friend.
The product works great as of now. It arrived as promised
Easy and fun to use. Nice to be able to now read e-books.
Need to definitely get a memory card. Not enough memory to hold kids apps.
Overall the product is great for listening to music
I've got this as a gift for my grandmother and she's not tech savvy but she can work a kindle. She loves to read and is very pleased with it.
Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.
Great way of upgrading to a Smart TV less the price tag.
I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use.
I purchased this item thinking it would show a higher quality in picture than the firestick but it does not in my opinion. Only difference it has more storage.
great item, if my hands are tied up, I can ask alexa about the weather or sports even songs with out the touch of a button
Bought two tablets for the kiddos. Overall, price was great and works well. Only issue is download speed. Tends to take a while to download apps and other stuff.
Holds a charge with regular use for well over a week. Backlighting is wonderful. Easy to hold and use with one hand. Nothing is better! Take that iPad
We purchased this Amazon Fire - Kids Edition for my 3 year-old granddaughter. Could not have made a better choice! She was up and running in no time and absolutely loves it.In fact, when my wife (who has an older model Fire tablet) started playing with it, she was so impressed with its capabilities that she now wants one for herself.Very pleased with our purchase!
Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(
Absolutely love this tablet. Many of the kid apps don't require wifi. My son is even able to watch Mickey Mouse clubhouse episode while in the car without any internet connection.
It is great to take my Tap on the road. Easy to use and sounds great.
Greatest item ever . For me, it is way better than cable. I bought one, it was so great, I bought 2 more, and gave away as a gift.
Amazon fire tv is a great product. It turns any tv into a smart tv. I watch all my movies and tv shows with the fire tv.
Bought it for Christmas. The picture is great and memory is plenty
This Product is Unique and does most of my work in home. I love it..
I am highly satisfied with the quality of this product. It has met every expectation for me and I would highly recommend to everyone. Better than holding a heavy book in your hand to read,.
Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....
Amazon tablets are the best android tablets available.
New OS 5 performs better than expected. No hanging screens and increased caching enables better video streaming. I purchased this as a replacement for an older model that my son broke - would definitely buy again.
amazon tv is apple tv with half of the price of apple tv. With more functionality
I already had a Echo but the wife apparently liked it more than me and took it over. I bought a Dot for about $120. Less than the Echo and personally prefer that. The wife decided she wanted another Echo for the basement. They are both great and work well with my Nest thermostat. If you get one you will love it. It takes a little time to figure out the best way to ask things from it so it responds correctly the first time. Bought it on sale for $50. Off.
It's like having a tablet with your own library right at your disposal
Great value for what I needed. Just using it to receive email ordersfrom Grub Hub for my restaurant
This tablet has pretty good resolution for reading and runs smooth on basic games
My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
Works great for all my steaming needs. I was able to transform my non smart tv.
It's a very reliable tablet for the little ones. Most enjoyable feature is how you can control everything they look at and what kind of apps they use.
This is my second kindle paperwhite. I lost my first one on a plane, so I had to replace it as soon as I got home from my trip. It's a great e-reader and is easy to set up and manage. Never had any problems.
I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Lighter in weight, no glare. The white background is easier to read than the previous model she had.
I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.
Being an avid reader with a preference towards hardbacks I was very skeptical of e-readers. Because I also travel extensively carrying hardbacks and having enough lighting to read has been a challange. My husband purchased a Kindle Paperwhite for me for Christmas. Upon opening I wasn't sure I was ready to go digital - HOWEVER I love it, I've already completed 2 books. The paperwhite is backlit and easy to hold. It fits in the palm of my hand so one handed reading is easy. I am now a believer ....
I really like the tablet. It is very easy to work and the graphics are very good.
I have no use for cable since purchasing this device. When used with subscriptions to amazon prime, sling, Hulu and Netflix, you forget you don't have cable. The stronger your wifi, the better your experience:
Alexa works well - providing a variety or electronic systems as well as music, shopping lists, etc.
This kindle is great for reading books. Which is exactly what it's designed for. Very crisp text in bright daylight or complete darkness. It feels good in your hands (weight is balance, it doesn't feel flimsy either). Quick page transitions when reading. Don't expect it to compete with tablets in the app or visuals departments, because that's not what it's meant to be used for. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the touch screen tends to be a little picky at times.
It's great to be hands free..just ask alexa to add to shopping list or play specific music..nice sound .. no typing required ... Love it
I am an avid Apple fan but Alexa has Siri beat! She's easy to talk to, she always listens and does what I tell her to! Lol
Great price and tablet. Kid friendly, good parental controls, works very well!
Got this as a step up from the Fire Stick, and can definitely tell the difference. No Lag! Great device. They've recently pushed an update which has cleaned up the interface for the better. We also have ROKU, which is also great.
I just love my echo , controls my Hue lights just so easy to use.
The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started.
A fun speaker not as nice as Siri however it will do
4th Fire we have owned. My daughter uses it mostly
These things are cool! With the new muti room music options I can have the same song playing in each room. Not to mention the intercom! Great item!
Got this for my parents to allow my dad to bring music into his family room,. I own both the echo and thee Dot. Love the simplicity of the personal assistant. Connected to my Hue lights, and nest thermostat. Alexa allows my wife to control our lights, play music or get a flash briefing via voice commands. Speaker is Pretty good for a stand alone unit. Voice recognition is very good. If you have home automation devices like hue, wink, nest or othe, the Echo makes them better than ever
Better than I thought From a techie guy... I'm a big geek I have tons of boxes and electronic toys I even have several Google TVs which are now outdated. I'm pretty blown away by this box, and the amount of content apps available. For instance the unknown Pluto TV app has over 100 HD streaming stations. Some of them obviously aren't great, but it's definitely enough to keep you busy. For hours on end. Some of the channels have an hour or two of programming and just loop over and over again, but there's enough content on other channels to keep you busy for days.If you're looking for the end all answer to cut your cable TV service, FireTv does not have things like live CNN, AMC and other cable stations (yet), but you could purchase a subscription for Sling TV (Google it) which has ala-carte live TV services. Something Apple is promising to deliver. If you have a current cable subscription, you can get things like HBO and Netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription. Your provider passes through the HBO, Netflix, etc programming through to this box. So for instants if you had an outdoor TV, TV in an attic or basement, you don't need to add another cable box to watch movies. .It has all the standard bells and whistles like Netflix, Hulu, and those sort of services . The box is fast, does what it's advertised. I have a Ultra HDTV. Although ultra high definition content is scarce these days, this box probably has the most ultra high definition content of any other unit. Granted a lot of those ultra high definition videos are of Flyovers of nature type videos. if you have Amazon prime, then you can stream several of their in-house shows in ultra high definition.Read more
The Amazon Kindle is a great device for any reader. It is simple to use and fits the purpose. Operating system is a little slow comparing to other devices, but gets the job done.
This is a full featured tablet at a remarkable price. I have used this tablet on a daily basis and not been disappointed. The only shortcoming I have found is that tablet cases cannot put the tablet to sleep or wake it when the cover is closed or opened. Given the price, however, I really have no problem with that omission.
Highly recommend. Even my 2 year old loves it, she likes hearing songs I have taught her.
Bought these for my 4 & 5 year Olds so I wasn't expecting top of the line performance, especially for 39 bucks. Pros- Good clarity Easy to useCheapExpandable storage with SD cardCons-Slow down loadsCheap camera (as expected)No mic for voice recognition. Would have been great for the kids to Google search.
Great product to own works well with everything. Very helpful for the family
I mostly bought this to give me Amazon Prime with HDR as it was not available on my Nvidia Shield. It does a great job, and has excellent performance and speed with the menus and such. Very intuitive and easy to use. That all said, the Nvidia shield received an update today that adds Amazon Prime, so it will probably become my device of choice again.
Great Value for the Price.Came to store to find a holiday gift and the fire was a great pick!
I purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions Will be getting my money back and getting a samsung..
This is the 2nd Echo for our household. We also have 2 Echo Dots for the kids. We all love them and use them throughout the house to stream music.
It's a really good tablet for kids my kids love them
Ok so when i got this tablet i was not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it...its AMAZING. PROS.their is no lag at all when play high graphic games, pretty easy to use, very fast speedCONS. in my opinion their is only 2 things that drive me insane the screen feels like plastic very uncomfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photos.OVERALL GET THIS TABLET BETTER Deal then the galaxy tab s2
This is a good product for a beginner who likes technology.
I got this to use DirectvNow and it works great.....
Very simple to set up and easy to use! If you are looking to start or add to your smart home this is the way to go!
Still discovering the many uses for the Echo. So many uses being discovered daily!
Our Echo has been a fun purchase for us. We've enjoyed hearing the jokes and just being goofy with it.
Got this on sale and it's very good, the interface is easy to use and super easy to set up
I love this kindle, the price is good, not too heavy and I charge once every two weeks
Great streaming device and it's a bit faster than the fire stick. Great buy.
Love my new Kindle FIRE, & LOVE the reasonable price at Best Buy!!!!!!!
I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol
I use it to read books that i borrow from thr library. So far it is great.
Easy set up great screen over time battery loses charge fast over all good tablet
Best product in the market! I love it and recommended to everyone!
Well worth the money. It does everything it say it will do and more.
Love the apps and set up done by the geek squad and the simple steps to set up
This is amazons cheapest tablet and probably oldest in the market. Good for the price.
Tablet is durable and easy to work with. My son takes it every where.
Like using it to play music, answering questions, playing favorite radio stations, setting timers in kitchen, telling jokes. Apps for games are few. Questions to Alexa must be exactly worded or she does not understand the question.
The Amazon Echo is their response to Siri in stereo. It has terrific voice recognition and constantly learns new things. The only shortcoming is that it doesn't play nicely with iTunes.
This is a great tablet. For reading and for games. Good for kids & adults overall.
I got this for my wife. With a little help from our daughter we got it set up. So far so good.
I got this tablet for my niece because while she was visiting with me her tablet that she brought with her stopped working. I got online and searched for an inexpensive tablet that would do the same thing that her non working tablet would do and so I searched and ran upon this tablet and this is it plus more!!!!
I picked this up during Black Friday and managed to get it cheaper than MSRP. My girlfriend and I have it in the living room to pick up and use whenever another screen is occupied by something else. It's very useful, and since we weren't looking for anything with deep features, it was well worth the price.
Nice tablet for a kid or teenager no allot of memory.
I bought this kindle on the way to the beach. I have an iPad but the glare is so bad. This has been great. I use it all the time outside.
Sometime it just stays in sleep mode and you have to restart it
For my son. He loves it. Has it tied into electronics in his room.
Tablet is good for the price. A good tablet for beginner and does what we need it for.
Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this tablet will appeal to you! Easy to understand tutorials, smooth animations, and more user friendly than Android or Apple products (and yes I own some of Samsung's and Apple's latest mobile devices) $49 is an amazing price! Best worth per dollar spent!
Just what my Niece wanted for Christmas! She is enjoying every minutes use !
The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is still the king of e-readers. I have an older version that I still enjoy and it was time to bring another Kindle into the house because of my fiancee. She loves the experience that the Kindle Paperwhite gives for the same reason I do, it eliminates a lot of glare and closely imitates an actual book. This a perfect creation that combines the classic experience of reading a book with the modern convenience of a tablet. A+ Amazon, A frickin' +.
Shipping was fast, well packaged and Easy to use!!
Kindle Paprrwjite is the best e-reader out there. Go for it!
I love my Echo. I am always asking Alexa new things. I also show her off to my friends and family. It's amazing what she can do. I also like the fact she can be "updated" with new things and I don't have to go out and purchase something to make this happen. I fun new technology with a great price point!
The tablet is going well for me and my son likes the app store
Before we bought this the house was always quiet. Now we stream music all the time just because it's so convenient. Really cool. Works great.
I started with the dot and I'm glad I upgraded the sound quality is way better she hears me when I Call her name It's a big difference
Bought two of them first one would not charge after the first day. The second one The screen went blank so I have to return it now only after a couple of days of use. Will not purchase any more of this kind.
I wanted a simple device strictly for books. I did not want pop up pictures or current events running across the bottom of the screen. This is the tool for me. I keep one at home and one in the car for wait times at appointments.
This is really a neat innovative tool. Would order
I got 1 for myself after the kids got them for Christmas and I can check up on them and see what they are doing and set parental controls fairly easily
Moves a bit slow at times but overall it works good.
While generally a minor upgrade from the paperwhite, it's just the best e-reader on the market. X-ray seemed unnecessary until I was reading game of thrones and forgot who certain people were. The choice to swipe or pinch to change pages is nice too. It's a great device though if you're on a budget you would do fine with the last version.
Nice packaging. Easy setup. Great for a middle schooler.
Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can).
Works well for the money. Got it from Black Friday deal. User friendly
I bought this for my 2.5 year old autistic son. We have downloaded all kinds of sensory apps and learning apps. It's such a wonderful tablet to take on the go as well as for home use!
This tablet fits my needs and at $50 the price is right.
Best tablet ever!Cannot put it down! Always ready to read, browse or watch tv shows and movies
This is my second Fire TV box, and it's a great upgrade from the first gen model I had. The buffer time is lightning quick, faster than my Roku. The 4K works well, and the Amazon ecosystem is actually more complete than what the Apple TV offers. Very happy with this purchase.
I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.
The Amazon fire Tv is an all around great product for a great price. It is a little more expensive compared to the Fire stick but it is well worth the price difference. The Fire Tv offers 4k compability and also seems to be a little faster. It allows me to watch all my paid subscription it one place such as Netflix, Hulu and even amazon prime without have to use my PS4. All in all I would recommend this product to anyone who has paid subscription it works well with them and let you view them all in one place.
Like it, this product is very powerful and useful.
My new Fire tablet is easy to navigate I have had two other brands and my fire is the best .
Little disappointed in. Item very hard to turn off but it is easier to read.
Can't stream smoothly unless plugged directly into the modem. Buffering was horrible (did not have this problem with Roku). Even plugged in it has some trouble with buffering at times. Only bought this because I got Playstation Vue and it only runs on certain systems. Unless you actually need the Amazon Fire to stream something only it can stream I would not recommend it. Roku is a much better system.
Wife's favorite of all the Kindles. She sold her Fire.
I have been using this for awhile and it definitely meets my expectations. It sounds great. It works all my lights.
Easy to use and great for downloading books from the library.
It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.
It's a great tool for family entertainment. Lots of things to explore.
this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse
This tablet was a gift to my nine year old and he loves it nice resolution fast, and slim. Cant beat it for the price.
Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.
I love this item it's worth the prize my son loves the tsnley
Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.
I've had my tablets since last year and they still in great condition, ii read on it a lot so I think I made a good choice
I have a desktop at home but this will let me know whats going on at all times......
My kiddo loves this tablet. She's 1 1/2 and knows how to work it well. I look at it sometimes and see apps that I didn't download! Lol Good thing, first year is free. It's very durable as well. Great product overall. I would've liked a different color for her, but blue was all that was in stock and I got it a great price being on sale plus I had certificates to use.
So happy to find this item in store--salesman made sure the price was lowest possible.
Great tablet!!! works very good and fast. easy to get apps
Amazon makes a good inexpensive talent for basic functions
Best reader in sunshine and darkness. Easy to use and re-load.
Heard about this through a friend. Was not aware the product even existed. Has really enhanced our time watching TV.
Love the voice control music and personal assistant that Alexa provides through this product. My son just loves it.
Love it, love it!!! Have had several different models. like this one the best. The Kindle Fire was nice but had a hard time reading at night.
Bought it accidentally. Meant to get an 8 inch screen.
Works well...is a lot of value for the money. Very happy!
I prefer this than anything else out there. It might be because I am partial to Amazon and its service.
They really enjoy it and I will buy it again for another gift
I had purchased the original kindle s few years ago and in December sprang for the new kindle paper white. I thought I might have been wasting money but it is definately an improvement to the original. It's lighter and so much clearer to read from. It's easier to read in dark situations or on flights at night. I love the differences the new improved kindle provides.
Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults
Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it
Friends were pleased with gift will be buying one for their family.
I bought this for my son's first tablet. I really like the product. Like the parental controls. For him I am not thrilled that with any parental controls he can't have free access to the web. It's blocked mostly :(.Needs a bit more memory so get an SD card. I would rate it lower because of this. But for what I paid I just cant. The graphics on Netflix are good. I can't come up with one reason for the price to give it less than stars. I own a IPAD and it rivals it. Especially for the price difference.
We love our Echo! We use it to control our Hue Smart Bulbs in several rooms, listen to loads of music, get the weather forecast, add things to our Google calendar, make a shopping list ( that Alexa will email to you) and are still adding "skills"all the time. The voice recognition is impressive. We like this so much we bought an Echo Dot for our bedroom
Easy to set up. Love the Alexa integration. Very happy!
Great for kids or anything to do with simple task. Great to for watching Netflix,YouTube or just checking email. Love play games on it from the app store. The family loves it.
The box is better than the stick must have for anyone that likes to stream
This is a good buy with the recent drop in price. Despite that I love how well it works. The voice recognition of the Echo is pretty good and I love the many questions you can ask it and the responses it gives you.
This smart box does exactly what it says it does. I like that it adds the pics and videos from my cell phone in an easy to use app.
It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
Quick streaming and 4k capable make this device perfect.
Really cool and useful. Kids love it also. Sound quality is good enough considering size and other capabilities.
What is there to say about the best 7 inch andriod tablet there is.
The kids love them! I purchased some tablets the year before off Amazon and they were cheap and broke quick I spent the same on these this last Christmas and they seem sturdier and better picture quality!
Fire TV is good except I have to reboot it more than should be necessary. It drops its network connection too often. Rather than reentering my password, I find it easier to just unplug it for a few seconds. Once, the remote became unresponsive . The fix: remove the batteries then put them right back in. Updates should correct these matters.
Had previously been using third gen kindle (2011) but this paperwhite is a great upgrade. Love the backlight and new font.
Works great as a reader, OK for apps. Battery lasts ages while reading, but dies quickly if I am gaming.
I bought this tablet for a gift for my nephew. It was a bargain on black Friday. I have not heard any complaints from my nephew yet.The only thing I did not like was the setup, it took too long.
Bought 3 for different and after 3 years mine went kerplot gona get new upgraded one for Christmas this year
Awesome price on Black Friday! Great tablet for reading and searching the Internet. Has expandable memory slots which is great!
Gave this tablet to my daughter for Xmas, now she can enjoy playing her games on the tablet
This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!
This good e-reader is a gift for my daughter and she love it.
This is the 3rd fire in my family. This one was for my mother in law. The other two are my wife and my kids. These are easy to use and work well with Amazon as you would expect. I would recommend them as a starter tablet. I have used both Apple and Galaxy tabs and this one fits in well.
Keeps my kids busy for hours the apps are excellent
Love my new paperwhite kindle. Syncs with my older Touch Kindle and if I let one battery run down, can pick up on the other. Love the ability to read my paperwhite in low light areas which could not do with older kindle.
I love how my son continues to use this tablet on a daily basis and he is only five years old.
Thank you amazon for making an affordable tablet that lasts! Enjoy the ease of navigating the apps. Good picture, and sound.
Excellent. Grandchildren love them. They were so excited to receive this and have not put it down since. Even my 2 year old is having a ball
This is the 3rd kindle fire I've purchased, the first HD in this size. I like the specs, the speed at which apps and books download from Amazon, and the accessibility of free time for my younger sons. Definitely a worthwhile purchase and I am also an Apple user.
Very fast awesome product...worth the money and i would definitely recommend.
Got it for Christmas for my 4yr old she loves it uses it to watch movies on it.. great for the little ones to use they have a great section of kid shows to buy at a very good price.
bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime
This is an amazing device! I would recommend this to ANY reader.
The tablet is a lot smaller than my old one, but it provides me with a lot more features, memory capacity, and lets me do things I wasn't able to do with my old kindle.
Very user friendly product. 100 times better than Siri. Play music from Prime music. If you have a Amazon Prime account, I would recommend you to try this product.
This is a great little tablet for kids works fantastic
Is there any better e-reader on the market? Not when you consider the overall quality and low price. This model has the same razor sharp resolution as the Voyage but with longer battery life. If you want a backlit e-reader, this is the one to buy.
If you just want a tablet that gets the job done. Then here you go.
Perfect gift for my dad, he loves to read. He is in love with Kindle.
I bought this for my grandma so she could use it in church to read the Bible. She loves it!
I am very happy with this purchase. My kids love it and find it very easy to use.
Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
Lots of stuff available to add to enhance performance.
She loves it, she has one of the first Kindles and uses it daily, so this new one was a surprise and she enjoys the color in some of the cookbooks. The clarity and the Washington Post was an added feature, and fact that it was so easy to use.
I use to have the Apple tv and I like the fire tv more due to the streaming and voice activation. I have just recently purchased this item but the streaming is quick and it is very easy to maneuver through the channels. I have told some of my clients about the fire tv over the Apple tv.
Fun product. Especially handy for putting entire music collection in one place with Super easy access via verbal commands. Also handy for hands free notation such as setting timer while cooking or jotting down shopping list. "Alexa- set timer for 5 minutes and add garlic to shopping list"
Works well, loud, and constant updates.Helpful for home automation products like hue lights.
Really enjoy being able to use alexa to voice control everything.
Bought this for my grandson. The first one had issues and Best Buy exchanged it. My grandson loves it!!!
This is very nice! The paperwhite is great on the eyes!!
Item purchased for my daughter as a gift. She is an avid reader, and loves the Kindle
I love this for the sheer fact that I don't have to carry around all of the different books I am reading. Those books can get heavy! The syncing between reading and listening on Audible has really improved since I tried using it with the original Kindle Fire tablet.
My phone (Note 5) is just a little small to hold and to read books on. This Kindle is much better. Lightweight, easy to read, great battery life. It's right on the edge of being a little big, but that's probably because of what I've been used to.
I'm surprised how great this tablet is because of how affordable it was. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because how to navigate it is a little confusing, other than that, love it.
Too
I was looking for a simple tablet, to be able to play a few games, read e-books, and such. It's not as fast or sophisticated as an iphone, or ipad, but it's simple to use and nice to read a book, or several on. I'd recommend for budget-minded users, who don't mind being tethered to wifi.
Really impressed with it. So many more features and works more like a cell phone than a tablet.
Easy to navigate for beginners. My child used it for homework.
Great price, item works perfectly and my daughter loves it!
I had the small Echo Dot & this was an addition. The speaker is so much better then the Dot & I was able to connect them together so I can hear my music in both rooms. Love the Amazon Echo. Great purchase.
Alexa is a fun toy, I think it has lots of undiscovered capabilities, that I discover every day.. It is question based. I sure wish I could have a conversation with Alexa, however maybe on the next update
Great item, easy to use,would recommend to anybody want to use!
Never loved or hated one of these before but, it's great cause it works
Great tablet my son loves it and everything about it. He loves playing the games and this tablet is very very fast!
I use my tablet for business and am very satisfied with it. It has excellent resolution and I have not experienced slowness. Good product.
Have a 7", wanted a bigger screen. This is perfect and price was great.
Was looking for something that would work with most apps when cutting the cord and chose this. Works as stated and way faster than even the new smart TV's processors. All but got rid of the annoying buffering times.
I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product.
You cannot beat the price on this tablet, but there is no bluetooth. Also, it really hits you hard with advertising and trying to get you to do everything through amazon. We bought it to use in the kitchen with our digital cookbooks.
happy I purchased it. Have had no problems and was easy to set up
It is really easy to setup & to connect to. Really easy to select programs
The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time.
Hard to beat for the price. Great for browsing, movies, web.
Great for surfing and shopping! Can't beat the price!
This is not a bad tablet for the price. I personally need a little more on high end side. The plastic look doesn't do it for me.It has a expandable Micro Sd Slot and decent battery life. I gifted it to the Mrs. and she loves it.
Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again
Talk about a bang for the buck!!!! Using at this very moment to write this review!. Love it!
This is actually really cool - great for parties... Surprisingly, Amazon was out of stock, but Best Buy came through!
Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere
Just as you would expect it sounds great and works.
Hate Amazon! The app store doesn't have cool apps!
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much.
I love this Kindle--easy to use, great on the eyes.
Amazon does it again. Worth every penny spent. Watch all movies, shows. I'm gonna purchase more!
Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet
It works great for all like to surf on the internet.
I bought this thinking since we'd bought several other refurbished things that worked, that it would be okay. The box never booted properly so the only thing we could stare at was the Amazon logo and the words Unknown Boot in the corner. Customer Service tried to help with the box but we couldn't get it to trouble shoot. Sending this box back.
Read reviews and thought I would not want this. Price was good and the product works.
I would recommend to others great playing games reading surfing the Internet.Camera works very good and easy upload photos when needed.
Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps.
Works smoothly, no problems. Amazin has a great selection of tv shows and movies.
really like the fire tv works great. def an upgrade from the apple tv
I cant comment much on the operation of this device as it was bought as a gift. But the price is super and past experience with Kindle readers promices you will get a excellent bang for the buck.
This game seems to be another good addition to the Pokemon craze. My son got this for Christmas and has played it often since. He says that it's "awesome", which is high praise indeed.
Amazon fire is so awesome I bought two one for myself and one for my daughter who also has an ipad but now she always has her fire tablet with her
It was just the worst software I've ever seen you could barely play or do anything
edge could be wider to make it easier to hold. other then that a very good product.
The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me.
The Bluetooth speaker is nice very loud and I love how it connects to my Hue! Which makes controlling my lights so simple and being able to listen to radio stations such as IHeartradio.
This is a great tablet at a great price! We bought a number of them as raffle prizes for our employee appreciation party and everybody loved them!
Reading in bright sunlight is now easy on the eyes
This tablet is pretty cool, and reasonably priced. Easy enough for kids to use and I would recommend for those interested in buying one that don't wanna spend a lot.
I purchased 3 of these for our white elephant games for Christmas. I ended up actually getting one but gave it away to a cousin. He loves it and says it works like a charm. Took him getting some used to on the Android system.
I am enjoying my Kindle Paperwhite. Its easy to use and I love the backlit format.
Bought this on a whim! I really have enjoyed using it. At first I wasn't sure what I would use it for, but over time I have found many uses and ways to enjoy it. I'm still learning! I am able to interact with items I didn't think I could interact with at first. We will see how the it goes in the long run
Much better than the fire stick. Faster more memory never lags.
The bargain tablet of the century, performance, convenience, and decent screen. Runs all the apps you need.
While everything about the Kindle Fire 7 is great, it is lacking good sound
Very easy to use. price is great . Very fast . My grandkids use it by them self. Videos look very good
The price was good, and while it worked, the tablet was decent, but about a week later the screen began to turn all white. I performed a factory reset, as the screen was barely visible but that did nothing. Heard it was a common problem with these. Won't be buying again, but if the issues are fixed in other models I would look at those.
Works good and for $35 buy 2! Does exactly what I needed
Well worth the upgrade. Performance of UI and app has been significantly improved. Voice remote with Alexa is extremely convenient. UI summarizes available content by streaming platform which is extremely helpful. would recommend over other platforms, especially if you are an Amazon Prime customer.
Easy to setup, and install. Only took a few minutes to hookup and watching movies. Simple to use, and navigate.
Bought as a gift. Wife loves it, enjoying and learning new features each day
Bought it as a gift for my mom she loves it and uses it all the time
If you are a Amazon prime member it's a must have even if your not you will love this I got the 4 k one could not be happier
This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great.
This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment.
I like the price and features of the tablet . Its great in this price
This is a great product, but I think I could've gotten the Fire Stick. Maybe someday I'll use it for what it's worth. But none the less, a great product.
My 2 year old son really enjoys the tablet it's great
I bought this tablet as a gift for my 8 year old daughter. She loves it and it's easy for her to use. We downloaded multiple games on it for her.
I'm very happy with this purchase. It is perfect for a child or an adult that does not need too much storage on their tablet.
Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
I LOVE THIS THING. HOW DID WE LIVE WITH OUT IT BEFORE HAND! Such and amazing product
If you don't have an echo or never played with one, you will be in for a treat. Words can't describe how much I love this thing. It controls home automated devices, finds information such as recipes, can do shopping for you, find reviews on products, play music, tell jokes, and so much more. I want one for every room. Now it will do phone calls and voice texting to people who have Alexa devices. The phone call on my weak internet was flawless.
Once it is programmed, it works great! It is a wave for the future for voice programming.
I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
I have owned a 7" Kindle Fire HD since they came out years ago. My grandkids were constantly asking to use it, so when these 7" kindle fire's came out I decided to get them for 5 of my grandkids. They have amazing quality for the price (I have bought the junk out there for $30 - $70 and that's what they are JUNK!) and the grandkids are thrilled. I wish I had bought it for all of the kids. I have recommended this tablet to all of my friends!
My GF got me mine for a birthday present and I just got her one for hers. Great for international travel. It's like carrying a dozen books.
Great for reading at nightLight is perfect on the screen
This kindle is a basic and easy to use eReader. Exactly what I wanted. The charge lasts for a long time so you don't have to worry about charging it daily.
The Amazon Fire tablet is lightweight and easy to use. Great for Kindle books. Small enough to carry anywhere. If I'm waiting somewhere, I'm able to read while waiting.
Works flawlessly. Good contender to my brother's iPad. Much cheaper in price. Win for me.
You cannot beat this price. I was looking for an inexpensive tablet for my kids and the Fire 7 worked perfectly. They strictly use it for games, but the Fire 7 has allowed me to monitor what they are downloading and will filter out content that I select as inappropriate. Plus, all this is linked to my Amazon account. GREAT PRODUCT!
Bought this tablet for my 7 year old. It doesn't have the best amount of memory but it does have a spot for a mini SD card. It's pretty durable and easy to use.
You can not go wrong with the fire tv the only biggest problem is it's hard to get your hand on one
Bought for my 3 year old and she loves it! Haven't had any issues!
This is a very nice tablet for a first time tablet owner. Reasonable price and able to expand memory with micro sd card
I got 6 of them they didn't have google plus me no like
Could not download apps I needed to control my tvs
Light weight is great. Screen is a little too small for some games.
Having not used android before I found this tablet very easy to use.
Overall this is a good streaming device. Pro: Almost every service is available. SlingTV performance here is better than Nexus TV, Fire Stick, or Chromecast. Can do some casual gaming. Available cheap with the SlingTV Best Buy deal. Cons: Sometimes returns to home screen. Included controller sometimes disconnects. UI is better than Roku, but that isn't saying much.
This is a great and functional tablet for a low price.
Works good, but a little cluttered display, I prefer the Roku
I originally bought the echo dot and took it back immediately to get the bigger speakers. It takes some time getting used to giving commands (word for word or it will not understand you). Use it play music and run multiple activities by voice commands. Would def get and/or recommend if you can get one when/if they go on sale again.
It's a great product I would recommend this to everyone!
Who needs a laptop when you can do almost anything with the Kindle Fire?
This is the best little affordable Android device around. Could use more memory, but love what it can do. The regular Amazon apps are just the beginning! Tons more you can do with it if you know what you're doing!
I gave this as a gift . A took a bit to get used to because it's not an Android. All and All a good buy.
I was pleasantly surprised about easy was to set up to the WiFi and use. I use it to play music but very helpful when setting up appointments and reminders.
Bought for my 2 year old granddaughter l, she loves it, so easy to use .. She can navigate through it with no problems
Wife had one for years, she recommended one to a friend for her birthday and her husband purchased this one for her.
A little difficult for inexperienced to setup but good price.
This tablet is great for games and music. My son enjoys playing games and music on this device.
Great, light, simple to use, worth the money, battery lasts for long time
Basically, the tab's features are good. There are huge Amazon collections. Kids can be allowed to use it without parents monitoring as parents control feature is good. Several useful Amazon products are offered free of charge. I hope that It is worth for the money value.
I was looking for a bedroom speaker and came across the Amazon Echo on sale. it fits my lifestyle and a great way to get my just bit smarter.
I do most of my things on my laptop but I wanted something to use while watching TV and so on. I saw this tablet and had to look twice because I thought maybe it was just a reader! I have used this installing apps, playing games, reading, texting on a free text app, Facebooking and so on. The apps are a little sluggish to install but once they are on they are speedy and work well. The clearness of the screen is so much better than any low line tablet at this price range. The tablet feels of good quality. It is not flimsy and cheap feeling. We bought two and are extremely happy. The trick is not to expect it to run like and upper line tablet. Love it for what it is ;)
She is like my personal assistant, but I wish she is as smart as Siri... but since there is no one else like her, she will do for now.
Got it as a gift for my son to replace his old kindle.
Not a bad bargain. Excedes my expectation! Dont let the price make you doubt it. Runs smoothly on any app and the battery life is OK.
Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
Bought for my mom, shes in love with it. Use for netflix myself love the 8' great size and cpu speed.
This is a great reader. As a tablet it will not replace my iPad
I'm having so much fun with Alexa no glitches so easy to work
I'm not normally a techie person, but I read so many positive things about Amazon's Echo and Alexa, I splurged and gave it a try. I absolutely love it! Of course asking questions about traffic, weather, recipes, etc. can be a blast, but I have to admit that my favorite part is being able to request any type of music I'm in the mood for, and even change my mind a few minutes later, without having to sort through CD's or putz around with the various 'plays' or radio stations on my phone or laptop. Definitely a gadget worth the money!!
my daughter loves it. she plays several games on her kindle.
this product is very nice and its nice to review. Its also very nice.
Very easy installation and works great! I'd highly recommend it.
This is an amazing item happy I purchase Alexa I highly recommend
Alexa is good for basic needs, weather, timer, streaming, but lacks the ability for proper search abilities like google. Also, the ability to stream books needs work.
There is not enough battery life to read comfortably. 7 hours, maybe.
This is a great device. It is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. It also has a very satisfying premium feel. The price, of course, is not worth it.. unless you can afford it. There are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution....but if you CAN afford it, I highly recommend it.
If you're looking to buy a firetv then this is the one. It's faster, better opitions, ethernet port and plenty of storage.
I love my Echo! I received it as a gift in 2015, and purchased it as a gift to give in 2016. WIN - WIN item that all ages and lifestyles can enjoy. Weather, news, music, and more ... Alexa is there! She even gets a few laughs when she responds to the TV commercials using her name. Yes, buy it for all the right reasons!
Fun and easy to use, install app and navigation.Good quality technology.
Echo is amazing. Takes a few days for her to learn , then seems to take on a personality. A little disappointed to start with but downloaded apps and Alexa is fun! Pretty much a toy. Here but can answe questions play music just a fun extension to a computer. Kids love it and so does my husband.
Pretty easy to set up. It's fun and entertaining
I picked this up after purchasing an Echo. I wanted something battery powered that would work the same as my Echo. I use both devices mostly for music. It's great to be able to hear Pandora, or my Amazon music library with just the speaker now and not have to use my phone, laptop, etc. I can just grab the Tap and go anywhere in my house, outside to the deck, anywhere that I my wireless will reach.
Love it!!! I can watch all my shows on it and save money by cutting off cable!!!
Overall, the tablet is well constructed and well engineered. The 'excited factor' for my son wore off quickly, including the included app services. Nothing negative to report, but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either.
Fire tv works great except for sometimes has issues connecting and staying connected to wifi.
Great little charger. It works well. Price was great too.
I have bought 3 of these units in the past 60 days and I find them wonderful entry level tablets for anyone looking too get the Best Buy for their money!
Good product and the quality of the product is good. Easy to use.
This tablet is great and my 4 year old son can run it easily. I had to reset it when I first recieved it bit after that worked great. He plays lots of games and uses the audio books. The battery life is good as well and charges fast
We bought several for our employee party. I liked it so much I bought one for myself.
Great tablet for children and for entertainment...
We don't have the fancy tv or lights alexa can control. But, we love the music, weather, adding stuff to our lists and calendar. There are a few games my husband plays --jeopardy, magic door, etc. The trivia and daily news are also awesome.
I bought this for my dad. He loves it and it's easy to use.
I was very pleased with the items I ordered from Best Buy. They were well respresented online, thank you.
Traveling in coach is horrible, so I was looking for a small light weight dedicated device that allowed me to focus on reading. This product is perfection. I've read several books on various iPhones, including my 7+ over the years, but they're nothing like the paper white display.
This on is much better than the original Kindle Fire it is replacing.
Easy to figure out how to use. I'm loving always having something to read without having books piled everywhere!
This device meet my expectations. Fully recommended.
For an android powered device and no google support it works alright
I bought this as a gift for my mother, she's not very tech savvy but she's able to easily navigate this tablet. She loves it and the price was great for the product.
This product is good but only missing is there are not much devices are coming with Echo, hope in future will see more. Other than this my son enjoying this cool gadget to check weather, alarm etc..
A tablet for under $50. What a good deal. Thanks Amazon.
i would and have told people to get one if they have a 4k tv
This was an upgrade from old Kindle. Screen is great and love the size of the screen.
this is a great tablet for under $100 and you can add kodi on it, to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera
Don't know I bought as gift for my nephew, we will see.
Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far.
Bought this for my daughter to read books on. Very pleased with the tablet so far.
Got 1 of this when it 1st came out. Returned the unit coz it won't boot up. Advantage buying from Bestbuy easy exchange or return. The second unit that i got works perfectly.
Very easy to set up. Just plug in and ask her questions. Haven't used parental controls so can't say anything about that.
We purchased this on the recommendation of our son and daughter-in-law. It was extremely easy to set up and we use it every day. We love the capability of being able to create a shopping list by talking to Echo and then being able to use that list in the store, even without internet access.
All around useful, enjoy full product. Does exactly as advertised. Will buy more for gifts. Our entire family and friends are amazed.
I recently purchased this item for various reasons and so far it meets my expectations. However, I did have an issue with the voice volume on the video why flying for 5 hours.
Love using it for the music and to keep a grocery list! She is the best. I bought 3 for my adult daughters for xmas.
No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
This was a very good buy at a great price; the tablet works fine for the purpose in which it was purchased and I'm very happy.
The Kindle Fire 7" replaced my old and broken Kindle Reader and has exceeded all my expectations and requirements. I plan to buy a 10" in the near future and pass the 7" to my wife to replace her Kindle Reader
This is a good tablet for beginners. I bought them for my children for Christmas. They have been enjoying them.
I love the new fire tv it works great with all my subscriptions
Easy to setup, battery lasts for as long as needed. You can do all the basics that a higher end tablet does and is reasonably priced..
Great gift for someone who has everything! Very entertaining
upgraded from prior models and like all new features
this is a nice little tablet. For the money you cannot go wrong.
This is a fantastic little speaker with the power of Amazon Alexa. I use it to stream Spotify, Pandora andESPN Radio. Small speaker fills the Garage like a concert hall. Battery last 8 hrs and the charging stand could not be simpler to use.
The power cord works well however, I am still trying to see if I made a mistake in buying the 5. I love its size but it should have better functions then the older models or I just don't get it.. I should know because this is my 10 th Kindle.
a great item to be able to stream tv/sports/movies without needing to pay a cable company for their services.
We had one when they first came out. Not quite as good but still works great for the kids.
My 2 year old granddaughter carries her tablet everywhere. She loves it.
It is a great investment. Can read at night without disturbing partner. Only disadvantage is if you lose your place it is a little difficult to find it. This could be user problem.
Great Tablet.Performs very well so far.Pictures and graphics are of very good quality.
a great product to access amazon with just voice, overall search ability is ok
Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
They love it, works like it should without too many issues
The one thing I miss is the google store. some games i love to play aren't available.
Bought this for my granddaughter's Christmas present and she loved it.
Just what I wanted and expected.
I read a ton and this had made if much easier for me to have accessible books! The light is perfect for my when my boyfriend is sleeping and I can't put a book down!
X'mas gift for my wife, and she love it! She loves the backlight that doesn't hurt your eye compare to an iPad.
Echo works well with a variety of different devices that have different protocols. It's an easy start to home automation.
Small tablet, I have an Ipad but this item is great to take along fits in your purse and is very durable. I have purchased 3 other for family.
We bought it for my son but the whole family uses it. We really enjoy it
Works Great. Thanks
Alexa rocks! Knows everything! Never talks back! A perfect roommate!
By buying my Kindle Paperwhite, I was able to download my college text books for less money then if I had bought them at the Campus store.
This a great item for kids to learn how to use electronics.
Love Kindle fire bought for an elderly friend and she just love the ease of use.
This is a great tablet for a good price. I bought this for my mother that has no clue about computers, tablets or anything technical. It's basically used for her to play games and she is able to navigate thru with a tutorial from me.
Good product for my family and gave gift to my fri
I only bought this tablet to pair specifically with a Bose Wireless Speaker. I was able to download the music I wanted and it pairs beautifully. Really sleek & simple.
Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn't be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store.
I bought two tablets for you little ones and they love them. I would recommend.
Great for reading in bedNot to heavy with great screen
We love the Echo! We are having fun learning all of the possibilities of options it can do! We have even traveled with it, and it works fine!Great speakers! Excellent sound!
Very easy for our children to use and enjoy for road trips.
Tablet bought for a 10 year old child. Perfect pricing for a lot of tablet. Great pricing and good product.
I bought this tablet to keep my ipad home during a trip overseas. I'm amazed with the performance of this tablet. It is fast, the screen is crisp and it provides pretty much everything I need. Cameras and speaker are low quality but not a deal breaker for me. I don't take pics with my ipad and usually use headphones. Free games from Amazon underground, free Amazon cloud for three months a the peace of mind it gave me; made this purchase a great decision. It also,makes a great reader. Love this little gadget..
Great device for streaming movies! Works great, very satisfied!
Bought for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it.
It's a really good product!! It does just what I needed for a great price
Best at its price. Just bought it because its less when compared ot other leading tablets. good for Skype.
Wanted a decent tablet for my teenage daughter without spending a lot. Other then the ads on the lock screen the tablet is perfect for her needs. You can remove the ads which to me is worth it.
very good e-reader. like the back light very much. very light for carrying around.
Have used this device for about 30 days with absolutely no complaints. I was only considering a couple of different units because I mostly use it with Playstation Vue, but we also watch Netflix and Hulu! Alexa is a really nice feature. Completely satisfied!
I love my kindle fire. It is a big upgrade from the kindle keyboard that i used to have.
The speaker is a really great convienence device. However my only gripe is that the speakers' sound warps at high volumes if there's a lot of bass.
This device is very interesting and I am just learning the possibilities that it can be used to do. I get the weather, the morning news highlights and it will find the kind of music that I like. I also understand it can be integrated into my home security system. I am looking forward to exploring the possibilities.
We purchased this tablet for our 3 year old daughter. She loves playing learning and interactive games. This is great!!!!!!
I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this.
I bought this for my 3 year old twins and they love it. It is very easy for them to use with kids free time.
Upgraded from a standard kindle to a kindle fire. Lots more features and about the same price.. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants a tablet but doesn't want to pay a lot of money..
My echo is outstanding plays my music with clear sounds in it hears my voice five feet away
Did exactly what I wanted it to do and more. Love it!!
Excellent value for the money can not go wrong for the price
Great little speaker for music, also voice commands are a added plus.
Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, the ultimate reading machine
Kindle fire 7 is a great affordable tablet has everthing i need.
Its cheap. and on Black Friday I got it even cheaper. Its not a competitor for iPad, but I do pretty basic things on my new Kindle tablet, so I am OK with this purchase. Nothing that impressed me
This tablet is the perfect solution for my needs. I could easily have spent much more money for features and capabilities that I don't need. Price, size and functions are just right.
We have had several of the Kindles over the years. This was a replacement to an HDX (wish they still made those). The screen is big and very clear and easy to navigate. Kids play alot of games and use it to read books on for school. I would also recommend these to family members, like grandparents. The screen size and ease of use makes for less calls back to the family IT person.
I wanted the technology but didn't want something that listens to the ever-present conversation in my home. The Amazon Tap fit the bill since one must tap its button to get it to listen.It works and works very well.
Love the shopping list feature, weather report, time, listening to favorite music.
For the money the best tablet you can buy. I bought a bunch of these for my nieces to play with. I love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activities.
Purchased as a gift for my mother in law, she loved it!
great for reading outside in the sun, or in dark rooms. very easy on the eyes.
This is my second fireTV that I purchased. It is very user friendly with plenty of apps. I use about 4 on a regular basis and the streaming is fantastic. With the extra ram, little to no buffering.Highly Recommended
Great tablet for all ages , nice HD colorLittle difficult for young children
Fire TV was easy set up and had no buffering issues.
The new Kindle Voyage is quite a step forward for the Kindle dedicated reader line. It is a beautiful device - almost like something from Apple. I like the lighted screen and the page forward and back "buttons" on the sides of the device. But it is rather pricey - not yet convinced it is worth the upcharge.
From the moment I set it up, I loved it! Helps me relax with whatever type of music I need at that particular moment. So much information at my fingertips, or rather " my voice"! Easy ,quick setup, what is there not to like!
Good: graphics & fast shipping. Bad: didn't like how it was like you couldn't get around putting in your credit card number.
Bought this for basic web browsing and low-requirement games. Serves purpose at a cheap price and has good quality and help support.
I have owned several Kindles and this is the best one yet
I bought this tablet to replace one I had bought a while ago for my daughter, all I heard upon opening is "Mom, you are the best", as she was excited to get a newer up to date Fire. She loves the fire tablet and so do we as a family. Amazon Fire is our go to. We can not switch to anything else!
I upgraded from the fire stick to the fire TV and man what a difference it made. Way faster a lot smoother and overall just a better experience than the fire stick. Don't get me wrong the stick is affordable and does the job,but if you want faster and smoother transitions from app to app the fire TV is the way to go.
Last got Fire 7" for my kids, with an Amazon Freetime subscription. These are very good for the price with two flaws: The screen is good and much better than other Android devices at 7" but not great, and got the 8 Mb version with I would not recommend in hindsight. Because Android's sub-par management on SD cards, got these this year. It has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 Gb is the minimum I'd recommend, even with SD cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in SD will still use some amount of internal storage.It also has Alexa voice support.The main reason for these tablets in my case is the Freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of age-appropriate books, hundreds (or thousand) of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. Amazon Fire OS has a decent support for multi-user and in particular kids accounts. My kids are 7 and 9. They spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books.
bought one for myself & then one for our 8 yr.old granddaughter who is teaching me how to use it
I have two of these and three Fire TV sticks. Both products are great. The customization, the store, availability of streaming services, access to Prime benefits, Alexa, the voice remote, these are all great things on both products. Having the ability to plug in external storage and Ethernet makes me a happy user. The additional processing power is noticeable in response time of the interface. I also have a variety of Apple TVs. I appreciate dev access to these devices but that is definitely a poweruser thing.
We have tied in our thermostat, asked about the olympics, listened to Pandora and Amazon Prime and it's told us jokes! We have loved this toy.
As everyone else has stated. Easy to read with outside. Great for under the umbrella on the beach also.
I am upgrading from a gen. 1. I love that I can add a mini SD for more storage, also a lot easier to navigate. My son now has my old one for reading books.
fun toy / tool / entertainmentplays pandora musicgets weather updatesnews
That's my only issue with it, vs the last one. But it was bought for a living room tv that does not use it so no biggie. Easy to install Kodi on. Just wish they would decode VC-1 files smoothly. Maybe the next gen?
Works as advertised. However, I can't imagine why Amazon doesn't include it with the Kindle. I know of no other product that does not supply an item that is essential to its use. Amazon should include this with the Kindle. So, remember, add the price of one of these to the price of the Kindle to get the real price of the Kindle. That is why I gave it three stars. Come on Amazon, stop the misleading pricing on the Kindle.
Love, love, love it! Very easy to set up. Was able to get rid of my cable bill after getting this. It's great!
Perfect e-reader with great screen and backlight. Works great in every condition. Definitely recommend the Kindle Voyage!
I always need a nice reader with better battery power.
I use Amazon Echo for the weather, timer, music, news, and am learning more and more uses for her. I am happy with this product.
Thought this would be too advanced for my 3 year old, but she loves it. Easy for her to navigate and learn patience. Games, books and apps are great for the age range. Parental controls have kept her honest.
This Amazon Echo might be similar to that of Siri and Google, however, it makes it fun to be able to ask it questions no matter where you are at in the room. It gives precise weather updates, interesting traffic details, and even knowledgeable history lessons each morning. With endless possibilities, this Amazon Echo is a step towards more interesting things to come.
I bought this for my wife who is an avid reader and she loves it more than her last one.
For the price this tablet is not bad (it was a $35 black Friday purchase). It does Amazon prime, netflix, surfs, etc. It is not a truly "open" android system, as it's locked down in some ways by Amazon (i.e. you cannot easily access the google play store). Some apps do not run on this tablet (presumably due to system specs). I think I had trouble getting Disney Channel app for this tablet, which is a shame.But for $35, it's hard to expect too much.
I have several devices I could read on, but I like to read outside on the deck, at the park, by the pool, etc., and I can't stand glare. The Paperwhite is perfect for reading outside. It also has a backlight feature so I can read in the car at night or in the bed without disturbing the wife. The Paperwhite is the perfect e-reader if you want something with no glare, very lightweight, and one that works seamlessly with Amazon. As a Prime member with Kindle Unlimited, my Kindle Paperwhite is my go-to reader for everything.
this I ,y grandson's second tablet. his first was a nabi. this one is very easy to use and setup. can also use parental controls. he and I both love it!
just what i expected and just what I wanted. thanks.
Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase.
For the money, this is a steal. Highly recommend. My wife loves it.
Need a replacement for my son and this tablet Is great .
There are so many uses for this. From shopping online to playing music to playing games. This also can be used for homework help.
great value as a beginner's tablet for a young person.
I bought this because a couple of my friends have it. Mine is in the kitchen and I use it all the time. Love that I can ask Alexa to play a certain artist or genre. Super easy to set up and use!
This was a gift for my elderly mother-in-law. She is thrilled with the fact that she can pull up any book she wants, at anytime, as she is an avid reader. It is also very easy for her to use, a BIG plus!
This device works as it is advertised to work. I'm very happy with this product. It is speedy fast processing and has great graphics.
Gave to mother for Mother's Day to upgrade her older Kindle. She loves it and enjoys the light since it doesn't cause a glare while reading at night in bed.
Initially I bought this for my son and he's been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue I have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and it's very difficult to insert the charger easily I may have a defective unit which I may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better
We wanted an inexpensive tablet for our 8 year old and this one is perfect. He can use it to read books and play games and it was very affordable.
This kindle is a huge step up from my original kindle. The backlights and touchscreen make navigation super easy.
Very easy setup. Works every time. I have my lights, AC and TV controlled by the echo.
I've been waiting for the ability to expand memory and its here! Along with that Alexa voice feature and an improved graphics engine Fire TV is headed in the right direction.
Great design, decent remote, 4k support, tons of app support, ethernet support, I love it!
The tablet is great overall. Its fast, smooth and many options to check out with regards to apps and programs. Great also if you have an Amazon account and also Kindle as well.
The fire TV is way better than the firestick. I hate that the firestick only works with Wifi and I hated all the buffering. I got the firetv and all of the buffering issues were eliminated.
WAS SURPRISED HOW GREAT THIS WORKS , MUSIC ASK IT QUESTIONS AWESOME
The general use for this tablet is only worth for Amazon users mostly so unless your buy and use Amazon products, I don't recommend this to anyone else. The tablet is not excellent compared to others but it is fairly good for an affordable price.
exactly as I expected. Backlight is great and easy to use
This was a gift had no plan to purchase one. But very pleased with the portability and the sound quality
I'm very satisfied with my purchase, I made a wise purchase
So far the Amazon Echo has been great especially at the discounted price. I'm still trying things with the Echo and I also have the Google Home and so far I'm giving the edge to the Amazon Echo as it looks like they have a head start on features.
I love this little speaker. I can just voice activate an alarm time or ask Alexa the weather for the day. It's amazing
So I've been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review's about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really don't know what your experience will be unless you try so I got it and began the prime "free trial " I was shocked to wake up this morning to find out I had been charged $107.00 for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with Amazon. the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the Alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync's to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues I think the tablet is OK but no great but because of my recent experience I rated it it 2 stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision
Works just like they show on the commercials. Great product!
This tablet is pretty good for a child, although what I dont like about it is you dont get Google play store
It works as describe on the box. I didn't research a lot but I did read about it a little.
I had a Kindle a couple of years ago and didn't like it, but with the great price and wanting to get another tablet, I bought this one and am very glad. I had some trouble setting it up due to password issues but now it's easy and offers lots to do and for sure more for me to learn. I highly recommend this product, maybe for someone starting out. It does as much as an IPad in an easy to carry package, great photos, email, everything, and the price cannot be beat.
I use this for setting alarms and reminders and for activating my lifX lights. The set up is super easy and sound quality and volume levels are really good too
Just like reading a book except you can highlight and read in the dark, so great.
I've always been a fan of gadgets,and I had to have it.I had read some of the reviews that were quite favorable, but I had to find out for myself.I absolutely love it. The sound is rich and room filling. In fact, the sound in bigger than its very discreet size.
After searching in multiple stores, Best Buy had the best deal for this great product. The product works flawlessly from any part of the room. The Geek Squad at Best Buy are one of the finest and best to approach for its setup.
Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
i use it for reading books and news it has a great screen
This replaced my old original kindle fire. What a great upgrade.
i have bought both the fire stick and the fire tv. This product is by far the best streaming device available on the market. i would buy more but i dont have anymore tv's.
I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
i really like shopping at best buy in avon indiana
Great way to kill time at the pool waiting for your tan to cook. Is easy to read in the brightest sun. Would like to have better search engine for new titles.
ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ITEM. UPLOAD ANYTHING FAST!!
It is not the greatest tablet I've used, but it is by far the best value for the money.
This has been a great addition to my media collection. Youtube in 4k looks awesome!
This was given to me for my birthday and I love it...
Good table for the kids haven't had any issues. Love it.
Easy to use and very fast. Like the fact that you can expand the memory through a mini sd card.
I got this tablet for my son at a great price. Plus it is more durable.
Very good product, very convenient. May buy another
Fine quality. I love the options available with the Amazon Fire tv.
Good technology. Does not follow command sometimes.
I have been using a kindle for many years. I love the ability to have all the books I am reading on one device.
I love this tablet. It's the perfect size for my kid. Keeps him entertained during long trips. We picked up the free time kid proof case and it's perfect also.
If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets.
Tablet does everything I need it to. Only thing I don't like is how short the cord is.
The size and clarity of this fire tablet is very nice
It has a delayed response. i can't access my email accounts unless I give Amazon access to control everything. I can't put my apps on my opening page. Amazon uses the Washington Post, I prefer the NYT. So far not a fan.
I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself.
this worked real well. very satified.i was able to download other apps too
This tablet has been great for my three year old. Only complaint is that you can't turn off the app download function on free time or see a complete list of what has been downloaded.
Easy to use. Like all of the features. Lightweight.
I've already read 4 books on this, and while it took a bit to get used to compared to a physical book, the convenience factor makes this a great purchase!
So far satisfied with product. Have not checked into all capabilities
Great price great product would recommend this gift
We use it for lots of things. The shopping list is wonderful- anyone in the house can no add something to the list as soon as they finish the last item and it is sent right to my phone. The to-do list keeps us on track. The music option, combined with Amazon Prime Music, is awesome! We use Alexa every day. We even play pranks on each other! I love to have Alexa tell my husband a bedtime store about himself. We laugh every time. The kids and hubby will send notes to my to-do list like "Be sure to buy your daughter the new video game she wants!" Very user friendly. Two things we would like changed- the pause between when you say Alexa and when you can say what you want is too long. I also wish there was to make an intercom out of multiple units. We have a dot upstairs would love to be able to project my voice from one to the other rather than yelling to the kids or going upstairs. :)
I actually purchased this tablet on Black Friday 2015 for my son. It works great with no problems. I bought 2 more as gifts for my nephews on Black Friday 2016. Plenty of green games to download. Great for kids !!
The processor is much faster and is pretty responsive.
Got this on sale during Black Friday. Great little tablet for the price. It isn't fast but gets the job done.
Purchased this for my mother for her birthday. She loves it. The large screen is what she wanted most.
Great buy and good starter for a smart home if you got all accessories
Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!
Third one I've had. Love reading on it. Can read in bright sun or dark. Other 2 lasted about 3 years. Only wish they lasted longer without freezing up. Can carry many books either from public library, kindle app, bookbub, or other sources. Free books abound.
Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
Easy setup...bought this for 2 grandchildren under 5...they love it
Bought this for my wife as a birthday gift. She has really enjoyed it. It is easy on her eyes, light weight, and keeps a god charge. It is easy to use, but she does already have experience using the original Kindle.
I brought this tablet for my 64 year old granddad and he loves it he says it's very easy to use and sends me pictures all the time of what ever he is cooking at watching lol
This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
This is definitely the Rolls Royce of the e-readers love all the new features that it has. Upgraded from the paperwhite to the voyage.
I love my Kindle. It does everything I need it to do and then some.
Get system, cannot see anyone not having one or two in their home. Easy to use, great features, a lot a movies available to stream.
Very portable and usable without the eye strain that is part and parcel of using a back lit tablet for prolonged periods of time. Able to read at night without compromising the ability to sleep later due to the suppression of melatonin caused by the bright light of a tablet. A decent cover is a must to protect the unit it is also is easier to hold.
After using a series of low end tablets as an e-Reader, I purchased this on sale for $50. It only really does one thing - display Kindle books in normal lighting, but it does it well.Size, feel, and battery life are all good, and unlike LCD-based tablets it is easy to read outside. The Amazon lock-screen ads are not that intrusive, and easy to ignore.
Daughter gave me one last year, so I returned the favor this year! She's thrilled and obsessed (her words)!
Husband lost first kindle fire right before Christmas, so Santa brought him this one as a replacement. He's happy! Seems to work the same as earlier model.
Couldn't ask for much more, performs smoothly, expandable memory, durable, inexpensive, and purchased thru best buy so all in all 4.5 out of 5.
I enjoy listening to I heart radio on this device all day
Bought this for my 89 year old mother. She loves it!
doesnot work After three weeks，I cannot open it. so sad
It is a device that basically is easy to setup and the remote is great.
I currently have it connected to my XBOX via TV in. Used mainly for Youtube, Netflix, Amazon etc. Device is easy to use and quick setup. The Alexa integration is also a great feature when I'm feeling lazy and want to speak commands into controller. If your looking for a great streaming device this is a great one to ownPro:easy setupapp store choicesability to side load appsAlexa IntegrationCon:Sometimes drops wifi connectivity forcing to restart device Apps crash (not frequent)
I mainly use for listening to music and it works great to have between the kitchen and living room. I was already an Amazon Prime member so set up was extremely easy. Family likes to ask Alexa silly questions...it's a little entertaining.
My kids watch movies in the car, I link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. I have set up hulu / netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. Amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. And worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!!!!!
This is the future, Siri/Cortina did help us, but it did not had open API access for customizing. Amazon took that opportunity and release Echo. Great product, lots of new commands coming out per week. Works with your existing home automation systems. This product did level set for any future product like Google Home.
This tablet is fast, expendable and cheap! It runs the Android OS, which houses most of the games and apps you'll find on any Android phone. My only complaints with this tablet are the screen and cameras. The screen becomes washed out at a 45 degree angle or more and the cameras are unusable due to the noise they produce. Otherwise, this is a really great product!
My son loves his kindle. Great product for the money.
A great E-reader that doubles as a tablet. This model even has an expandabel memory slot. Great price I bought 2 for gifts
I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on.
Really cool, not using near all the features so far but hope to add soon!
Enjoy using the echo as we learn more and more it can do each day. Plays any music any time. Could not be more fun.
You will very quickly learn how to talk to her in a way that she will understand and it's not unlike speaking to a small frustrating toddler. Alexa, when was George Washington born? George Washington was born...blah blah Alexa stop. There were rumors his teeth were wood but these turned out to be false, ALEXA stop speaking! There will be many times she will not understand what you're saying which can be both frustrating and hilarious. Alexa, put tomatoes on my shopping list. I've put potatoes onto your shopping list....Well, guess I'm eatin potatoes. That said, now that I've learned how to speak to the Echo it usually does exactly what I want it to do. I think the echo is well worth the price
The Kindle Voyage is always with my in my purse. It is light, compact and easy to hold. I still love hard cover books but now I don't have to carry around the books from my book club. Some of the books I would rather not have to keep up with anyway. And, I can jump back and forth between stories.
I'm currently in love with this item, setting reminders! Also playing music with spotify and bluetooth!
Works well and does what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it.
I bought this tablet for my granddaughter..it is perfect, and she loves it.
Didn't think it is well made the product ask for too many sign up
Great tablet for the price. Easy to read documents.
I got myself the newest, big Kindle Fire, though my old one still works. Got this for the grandkids, and they LOVE it too.
great for kids of all ages..........................
We got this for my son foe Christmas. Loves it and keeps him entertained! It is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it comes with. The only fault I see with this is in kids account. Before you load anything on to it, there are already tons of apps available to download as you please. I wish there was a way to have just the apps you choose to show up. I do also wish that there was a way to lock the screen, or app that he is playing at the time so little fingers don't get off the app accidently, he is only almost 2 though so I cant complain too much. Other than those two things my son loves it!
Pages look great. Adding books and documents is a snap. Reading books on this kindle is fun. Also very useful for manuals, installation guides and other technology related materials, since they tend to be very big in print.
This tablet works great but the only down fall is often times it slows down. Other than that great tablet for children at a good price.
Paperwhite kindle is great...especially when reading outside in bright light (like at the beach or in the backyard patio)! This is the main reason for getting it. No glare!
It's basically adding "smart tv" to my "dumb" tv! A lot of free movies to choose from, some rentals seem rather high, but no biggy because there a lot of options out there for that. Love the lyrics that play with the music!!
Great for adults and kids!!! No need to be tech savvy with the Echo. Works Great and easy to use!!!!
We are thrilled with our "Echo" Alexa is a wonderful and useful addition to our family and daily life. We continue to find new ideas and uses for her all the time and are amazed how helpful it is to have her close by.thank you so much for this "genius" .
For the price it is great and it is quick to search
I bought this for a family member because they had the smaller 7" Amazon Fire. The 10" version can be held easier in my opinion
Bought his for the lady because she kept getting distracted when trying to read things on the iPad. Plus the lighting on the iPad is a bit harsh when reading at night. This was the perfect answer to both of those things.
I purchased a Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet for my husband who has never used one. It was easy to set up .To help him get started, I moved the apps that he wanted to use to the top of the screen. In no time he was taking and storing his pictures and searching the internet.. The only thing we wish it would do better is turn on faster.
i am very pleased with this purchase. Thank you BB
We bought these for our 6 and 7 yr old kids for Christmas. They use iPads at school and are used to working on a tablet. The fire has been an excellent choice for them. It is easy to navigate and user friendly.
The Amazon Fire for Kids is an excellent starter tablet. The supporting games and apps are exceptional. Use of tablet is simple and non-intimidating.
Love that I can read inside with the paper white. I replace my originalkindle with this.
Bought the original Kindle a number of years ago and really enjoyed. This newer model is terrific. Fits comfortably in the hand and the readability is excellent. Downloading is even easier than before. I really enjoy using this product. Would definitely recommend!
I was having issue with the wifi for my main laptop, so I needed something that I could check email and writer posts on. Now I mostly use it to play games and watch shows through apps. With all of that, the battery only lasts for a little over 3 hours before it needs to be charged. The tiny charger that comes with it isn't that long, so don't expect to be able to do anything with the tablet while it's charging. So if you need or want something that's bigger than the average phone screen to watch movies, read and check email or read books, I think this is a good bet.
I like it so and so my kids like it very much.The application is amazing.
Works well and even better with amnazon music. You can choose an artist and it will shuffle through the songs on Amazon music. It links with Apple so you can have a music library. Sometimes it doesn't always hear you but works well with a personal library, Amazon music, iheart radio, siriusXM, and the premium version of spotify.
I am very satisfied with this new Kindle. I had gotten another brand, but had to return it because of problems getting books from a library. After talking to my library on how to download books with this Kindle, It was a breeze. The only thing about getting books from the library, Amazon will not let some library books be downloaded. All in all, I really like this product..
purchased for my grandson. He loves it. When setting up be sure to update the software
This was a great tablet for the price for my wife. Perfect size and good for traveling.
My granddaughter loves watching movies and it goes everywhere with her the size is easy to watch and it has a great picture .
Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.
I love the idea of Alexa and the next step to home automation. Alexa is fun and helpful at the same time. Updates on the weather and news as well as some facts, how to spell, etc. Sometimes it does not have an answer like "when did NASA land on the moon"? I can control my thermostat, play all sorts of music, radio stations, control it all from my phone and more. There is a third party software company IFTTT that has appellate to allow you to accomplish much more with Alexa.
I can read it outside in the sunshine and get a tan and enjoy a good book!!!
This is my 2nd Alexa in the house. Love the speaker on the bigger one. the Dot speaker is pretty lousy.
I bought this for my gran as a Christmas gift. She plays games on it all day, checks her Facebook and loves it. Super easy to use. If she can anyone can.
I bought the echo to use in my kitchen because it doesn't take up much space. Wasn't sure how we would like it but it has been great.Anytime someone goes in the kitchen they have it on. Ther is always music playing.The sound is really good also. There is so many things that Alexa can do but we haven't even tried yet. She tells us the weather every day. You can also time more than one thing when you are cooking and that is really great. We are very happy with our purchase.
This is a great gift for kids! Gave this to a family member and it was a huge hit. Cool new tech toy and educational at the same time.
The box needs a 4k tv for maximal viewing pleasure. Will not turn your tv into a 4 k machine. Sure will help a little with graphics. If that where the case people would buy cheaper tvs then this box. And it is much faster than original. I have box for different rooms.
It works great.
Easy to use. No trouble downloading books from free sites.
Bought for very young grandkids. You get what you pay for. A little slow. Good for watching things like Netflix and playing games and JWBroadcasting. Navigation okay. Not great. Kids are usually hard on anything, so if it gets broken, ok. But no problems so far and the kids like it. Would never buy for myself, or anyone over 10.
I wasn't expecting much for the price but I really enjoy using it. I mainly play games on this device. I would totally recommend this device to anyone.
Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare.
Works well while in the kitchen are covered in food.
I have a couple kindles so got this one for my mom to replace a tablet I had got her last year. I didn't realize it was smaller than mine but that was my own fault. Works as expected!!
Love the product, specially the backlight feature.
Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.
Great Family Christmas Gift! Fun for the Whole Family!!
This product is a great learning tool for my 4yr old toddler. It's has the option for kid mode or regular tablet mode.
This is perfect for my 2 year old. I love the option for 2 accounts...the kid account is very streamline.
bought this for my step daughter, she loved it, goes everywhere with it.
Love waking up in the morning & easily getting my calendar & the weather from Alexa. Then I can tell Alexa to play my fav morning radio station. In the evenings, she helps me cook with measurement conversions & we play daily Jeopardy:). And I keep discovering more that we can do with this fun device!
Awesome speaker and home automation control. Very recommended.
love my kindle it's awesome read on it in the dark all the time
Got this for someone as a gift and they enjoy it, asking for the weather while doing other things around the house or having your favorite music play. I've tested it and am amazed and what it can do, look forward to what it will be capable of in the future.
I gave this to my 3 yr old to play games and watch movies. My TV's have been reclaimed!
It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
Great buy , bought eight of them everyone uses them daily and they enjoy them
I would highly recommend this item. Great home speaker. Plays anything you ask. Also gives you weather info and about anything else you want to know!
I wanted to buy my mom a simple tablet that she could easily work. Great for beginners.
bought for my friends, but good enough! why need so many comments?
Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well.
This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
I choose store pick Up in New York and works Great. Love my Kindle Voyage
I recently bought my fourth Kindle. I bought it because it is familiar and while there are improvements the keyboard is still difficult and not accurate. I also do not like the auto correct especially when writing a document. Browsing is quite good but I am a AOL user and Kindle makes it difficult to use. I definitely would like to see some improvement with making it easier to print.
We needed something to be able to stream all of our subscription services. A friend told us a fire stick would be perfect since we have prime and this turned out perfect!!!
My wife gave this to me for Christmas and one for my daughter. For the money, I thought it wouldn't be worth it, but I was wrong. It is really way more powerful than I thought. I can do Word and Excel, PowerPoint, pdf's, work email, surf the Internet, movies, books, games...pretty much everything I thought I needed to spend 10X the money to get. I'm very surprised and happy with it. Only two I would change: a better picture and stop the ads on waking. This is a great value.
Love it ! I started with a kindle,then a fire kindle, and now a fire tablet. I can do everything from reading, listening to music, watching movies to surfing the internet. Well worth the money.
Easy to operate. Easy to download books. Size is great for carrying in a purse. Color is really good. Very happy with this product.
This has been a tremendous item. I'm so glad I did my research and picked this piece for online television.
We like our Echo, but maybe slightly pricey. It's a great speaker; easy to set-up & connects to you phone.
I love these because they are able to be programmed and watch anything and everything in the world!
I purchased 3 of these for Christmas gifts. Our family has several Kindles and they've all been very good tablets! They're great for all ages too.
Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn't slow.
Bought one at the store and liked it so got one for my daughter inlaw for Christmas
You cant get a better device for reading ebooks than this. The battery lasts weeks and its extremely light
My 12 year old loves it. She uses it to watch YouTube and stream music.
This is my third kindle. I mainly bought this one so that I would be able to read on the beach.So far I really like it.
I bought this for myself on Black Friday and am very pleased. For a FIFTY DOLLAR tablet, it has a great display and battery life. It's capabilities are below many system requirements of applications and games meaning they may not run at all or if they do, poorly. That's fine for my needs as apps/games aren't my focus. If you're buying a tablet for games/apps I would recommend looking past the Amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. It works great for my needs. The volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so I have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. It's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' Note: the invisible screens for this tablet are SUCH A PAIN to install and in my opinion not even worth it. If you want to protect the screen, I would recommend going with amazon's fire case it's very nice quality and the cover flap flips over to protect the screen when you're not using it.My point, if you know what you're getting and are ok with that, you're going to really appreciate this tablet.
i am so pleased with my fire tv ! Very easy to operate!
I was looking for a tablet for my niece and I got it for 37 $$ no other deal can beat this
Bought this for my Mom as a gift and was really disappointed. This device DOES NOT RUN FULL ANDROID. You cannot get third party apps even though they sell it as tablet. This device is only good if you only use Amazon (shopping, books, games), otherwise you can't download anything - not even a weather app. Not worth my money to be so limited - Returned the device and got the Lenovo Tab 2 A7 and we are MUCH happier with it!
I replaced this with a fire stick hoping it would be faster, and it definitely is. It keeps apps opened to where you last left them, no more loading the app every time you turn on your tv. Well worth the extra $55.
It responds better to my husbands voice than mine but it's been helpful and very easy to use.
I have only had this Amazon Fire Hd8 since December 6, 2016 and it has already quit charging.
This was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. It was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great Amazon warranty.
I had always wanted a fire tablet and when this deal came along I couldn't pass it up! Great tablet and well worth the price! Lots of apps to choose from, easy to set up and use!!! I highly recommend this tablet for anyone!
Great for the price. I bought it to have access to pureflix. I'm loving it so far. Would recommend.
This isn't the best tablet, but for casual gaming, youtubing, the price was perfect for this tablet on black friday.
Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
I recommend everyone get this special product. The fire tv is so easy to use my five year old daughter knows how to use it. Everything is straight forward and is easy as one two three in setting up. I have tried other media players and this one take top billing. What are you waiting for, go get a fire tv if you haven't already.
The only issue with this kindle is the price, otherwise, it's awesome. Light, compact, with a long battery life and tons of features... like an automatic backlight which is useful if you read at night.
great product for home use and set up.............................
Got his tablet for my 7 year old she so she could play apps and watche videos. Works great and to be able to add memory is a plus.
I bought this as a present for my wife. She loves to read. Since she got it a month ago she has finished 3 books. Great product! My wife loves having access to books immediately!
I would love to get one for my Dad for Father's Day!
Very happy with this tablet. My grandchildren love it!!
I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.
Nice size and very nice video quality. Finger swiping much more effective than using a stylus.
Great product fun and interesting would recommend to everyone
Works very well. Compatable with lots of programs.
I am a believer of streaming TV, especially with the cost of Comcast bills continually going up. I like the fact that I can watch what I want when I want. When you look at what you pay Comcast and AT & T for TV, it makes more sense to look into these Amazon devices in which I have 3 now.. I've personally turned in all of my DVR's to Comcast. I went from $182 to $98 a month. That's almost half. I have the Comcast package just above Basic with internet Blast. Also, if you look on the internet, you'll find ways to get free channels with this device. I'm saving money and have access to more things to watch now. What more could you ask for.
I was a little worried at first because I brought the tablet for my 7 year old but so far I have no complaints
Excellent for reading and has lots of other uses with wifi
My granddaughter LOVES it! LOTS of kid-friendly apps for a 5 year old!
Very easy to install. Got all I want and if you like apps you love this.
Great ebook reader with ambient light, page press, and sharp text. It is thin and light.
Look no further excellent streaming device, great processor , good ram , expandable storage , also supports 4k what else could you ask for
was easy to set up, easy to use somethings are limited like music unless you have a prime account, like music, however I did find out you can use pandora or music saved on your phone. Overall a great product still learning new stuff everyday.
It's a good little tablet. Not the fastest thing but good enough for 40 bucks can't complain.
I have always had a kindle fire but I had one that was just overloaded with books and so I bought a new one with more memory. It is awesome and so fast. But also the battery charges very fast and hold a charge for a very long time.
I love my new kindle. It's very slim and easy to use!
I had a 7 inch kindle hd tablet. I wanted a larger screen so I purchased the 10 inch kindle. I am very happy with the device. I surf the web, play some games, read books, and process my email.
This would be a great deal due to the good price for an better than entry level Android tablet... but... it is impossible to play music from Google play on it. Only Amazon! That's ok, since is their business, but should make that cleat to not waste time to buy and return it :(If you have a short budget and don't care about being attached to amazon only, this tablet is for you.
I just do know how I can live without my new firestick! It's so easy to use and so much to see because of this!
The best voice activated device I own. Gets it right 90% of the time. So easy to check weather, time, top news, alarm.
I love my tablet. It is easy to use and it was ready to go when I turned it on.
Perfect for basic stuff, games and media. Reading, too.
Let me start by saying I hardly ever get to use the Amazon Echo...my kids have taken over and talk to "Alexa" like their long lost sister. every morning "Alexa, what is the weather", "Alexa, play xxx song" and so on. It has been a great addition to our smart electronics and we are continuing to learn new things about the echo and how to add an increasing number of other items to the controls. Very fun and very useful at the same time.
Great option for watching tv without a cable subscription.
my 3 year old loves her kindle, Netflix and an abundance of games for her to learn from. Exceptionally easy to set up and use
This product really helped my father in law hear and have conversations with his daughter who's voice is a higher pitch.
i can't get it to work with my home automation like Harmony Remote
I use Alexia every day to turn on lights (zwave) and change channel on my TV (logitech harmony hub). I have a few DOTs around the house too.
In this day and age of everything online this is the one to have. It works so easily and smooth.
My 2nd generation Kindle finally died so I bought the Paperwhite as a replacement Love the size, weight, screen feel and best of all the backlighting. Can't go wrong with a Kindle Paperwhite!
I bought this kindle for my daughter, she loves it. Now I have three kindles at home for my kids.
product is very intuitive and easy to use. works well with the phillips light system
glad I got this kindle. can take it with me, and I can actually see the screen
Works well. A nice upgrade from our old one. Easy to use
It's fun to be able to play music, control the temperature, and ask questions to a box on a credenza... But it's missing one key integration... Control of the fire stick!
I bought a few of these over the holiday for my niece, nephews and step daughter. They love it. I especially love the parental locks and restrictions that can be put in place. Helps to minimize what the children have access to.
I like it better than Apple TV. It's easy to use and get lot more apps
The Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader of them all. You can not beat the quality of the screen. It is the same resolution and ppi as the more expensive model of Kindle the Kindle Voyage. The only issue you may have is the limited storage capacity of 4GB, but that's the standard storage for most e-readers.
Fire tablet is a cheap one but good enough for my porpose. Actually you get much more than what you pay. Is an excellent retribution for your money.
bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
Great tablet, not for the power user. Average users will find everything they need.
Perfect purchase for the avid readers in my family. Both my son and I enjoy using the Kindle. So much easier than carrying a book around especially when the book is a tome!
Great product for a beginner. I bought four in the past month.
Awesome for 4 year olds. Tons of security features and very easy to use.
We bought a Samsung washer and a drier. Product quality is great and the customer service too
No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great
I bought this tablet with the desire to Root and maybe flash a custom ROM. While you can down grade to a previous version to root with kingroot, you can no longer flash custom roms. Still happy with purchase. This is my 3rd Fire 2015.
What else can I say? I can finally watch 4K content on my TV. The firetv is ever bit as good as the firestick.
bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features...
We love Alexa and our Echo. If we need an answer, all we have to do is ask Alexa.
The kindle fires have been great for the grandbabies.
This is my second Echo and I also have a Dot. Decided I needed one for my office. Sound is great, set up was easy. I would say that Alexa has gotten used to my voice because I find it is 95% accurate. And, the few times that is just pops on when I didn't request it...well I go to my Amazon account to see what it picked up. Usually good for a laugh. One day it played a children's song "The wheels on the bus go round and round". You can't go wrong with one.
Bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter because of the price. I may go back and get myself one. It takes great pictures. And it is easy to use.
I found the echo easy to use, just wished it had a wireless version
I purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it.
This Amazon Echo Literally is a plug and play product. Even an old man, old school non-techie like myself was playing stump the band in no time.
It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
Looking for a streaming media box? This is a fine android based one..it has an Ethernet port, streams, does 1080p, Amazon, and if you have all android stuff it's fine..I really don't like that it doesn't have a volume control..the only difference between this and the fire stick (for me) is the internal storage capacity, and the Ethernet port..so but two fire sticks instead of one box, unless you want to play the apps
The echo works well. I have only gotten into the beginning of issuing it and it helps me a lot
This gift was given to a relative who is hospitalized for an indefinite period of time. Perfect way to stay connected; great alternative to purchasing hard copy books.
This little tablet is marvelous! I do not have a smart phone and this slips effortlessly in my handbag to be scanned at a store etc.. It's quick to respond and I can't say enough about it.
I bought this tablet because it seemed worth it for the price. However, it only lasted 6 months before the battery died and was not chargeable, regardless of troubLeshooting and what cord or outlet I used.Best Buy said they couldn't do anything but said Amazon could help me since it should be under warranty. I escalated multiple times with Amazon and they refused to help me each time. So save your $49.99 and put it towards a good product.
first tBlet that i got was defective and returened and got anothers one because when i powered on screen was totally white
I was looking for something easier to read emails with than my phone, but small and light for travel. This is just the right size. I have an 11 inch tablet but it is too large and heavy.
One of the best electronic devices I have ever purchased. Just a few things I wish it would do better like sync with Apple devices better.
I can't say how happy I am with this purchase. No worries of lighting, or holding a book open. All my books stored in this kindle which opens up lots of space in my home. Easy & light to carry.
After struggling to read books for the last several years, my husband suggested getting an e-reader. I never wanted one, because I previously enjoyed the feel of a real book in my hands. He was pretty convincing, so I went online and researched a few different ones. I settled on this one, after reading so many great reviews. I wanted the Voyage initially, just because it had page turn buttons, but I opted to save some money, and the page turning with the touch screen is incredible, I don't think I'd use the buttons, even if I had them. I am already halfway through my first book, and I've had this less than 24 hours. I'm a very slow reader, so this is impressive! I tried it in the sun, and it was extremely easy to read- no glare. I also used it while working out today- it's very easy to adjust the font to make it easier to read. I am so in love with this, and am so happy we bought it! I am excited to get back into reading, and to have thousands of books at my fingertips!
Buy it. These are awesome. Love them! So much can be done with them. Best on the market. Worth the extra over the fire tv stick.
I love the fact that this is so much faster than the Amazon stick. Wonderful product.
The Echo has great sound and is easy to use for all. I also got one for my mom and grandma and they can use it easily.
I use this regularly and have had absolutely no issues so far. It streams seamlessly and the remote with the voice automated speech works great.
This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes. Some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass, but it does the job for our family.
This was a gift for an employee. He likes it very much.
apps constantly fail to open. no flash for camera. hard to download anything not amazon ie: google apps. will be returning....
This device can do it all . The device also has nice voice command.
Excellent love it works great love design..wonderful
Great to have, very friendly and easy to use, my daughter uses it to check her math problems, and any silly question she has Alexa has an answer...
Very easy to set up.. Excellent remote and fantastic quality picture
Got this for a Christmas Gift and they love all the things it does. No complaints yet
Amazing product for home to control all of your home automation
I like the product. It's for my son so it should be fun
Great for the price. Get a screen protector though
It was a gift for my wife. She wanted to listen to music in the kitchen. Sometimes it disconnects from the internet.
Great product. Being able to connect to the modem directly is great. Solves some of the streaming issues normally associated with using wifi.
I have 4 of the Gen 1 Fire Tv boxes and they are good showing their age. I purchased the new FireTV only be to disappointedPros.. SD Card slotCons.. Many Apps just don't work or are buggy...Search is terrible and only gives Amazon options .. Nvidia Shield also gives my plex server option .. now that is cool... not much faster.. if at all than Gen 1
Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!
Great tablet! My niece and nephew love it. It is a great product for the price and I would recommend to anyone looking for a great and affordable tablet.
Got tablet for daughter, great tablet, size and easy to use.
It is a great simple tablet. Easy to use anyone can use it it.
The kindle paperweight is a nice sized tablet good for reading in any lighting. You're able to see it in the bright sun light as well as the dim lit room
I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make)
I really enjoy this tech item. Great buy! It's kinda cool to be able to give all types of commands and see them occur.
I like this tablet ...............................
This tablet is very easy to use and a perfect size.
Love the echo. Purchased for my mother in law for Christmas. We have had our own for about a year now.
Does not have answers for a lot of questions. But is fun to have
Nice interface, easy to use. Smooth, no buffering.
It's a good product to use I suggest people buy it
We bought these for the kids and they just love them. With the parental controls on it we don't have to worry about where they go on the Internet.
Much more memory that my prior kindles. Luv that I can add a sd card for extra storage
I was very surprised with the sound from the speaker. Very easy to set up, wide range so that the system can "hear" my instructions from far in my room.
This device has already been used by all of my family for fun and looking up school information
good for the price, better than i expected. highly reccommend
Purchased this for my niece for Christmas. She loves it. Great for the kids, or if you're not looking for anything specific. Lightweight, easy on the eyes. You don't mind spending that money especially for a kid that may break it...because they're kids.
so far it has been working really well especially for the one's it was bought for. It's their first time using one and everything seems to work well. It takes real nice picture's and is very durable.
This is my second kindle but this one is light years ahead of my first. The refresh rate is so much quicker and the back light makes reading a pleasure. I prefer this to my IPad mini.
This is actually my second Kindle, as I left on a trip and forgot mine at home, and I didn't want to be without it! The paper white, wihich can be used outside in the glaring sun, makes it a huge winner for me!
Very durable and easy to use. Last for several years with all that it can do.
Not sure what I can add that thousands of others have not, but the Echo is an awesome device. New features added every week. A must own for anyone interested in the Smart Home movement.
Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!!
I like it. Bought it as a birthday gift for a three year old and they love it
battery life is good. clarity and color are good. still learning how to navigate.
Very useful. More better for reading than ipad. good for eyes
This is a great tablet for my elderly mom. Compact, but easily readable.
It allows us to watch movies and stuff that we normally would not get to see.
My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled.
I love this tablet. It's durable and my niece loves it
Bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she has a blast on it. Be sure to get the kid proof case too. Got to protect your investment.
Very easy to set up. Can be a challenge to use with two household accounts. Requires a certain series of words to execute a command. I get a little tired of "I don't understand your question".
Love the battery life & back light makes it easy to read in any setting
I love the updated features with this kindle. Although I did like the length of the Fire.
I can lock the screen so he can't mess anything up while I'm playing him an educational video plus built in case to handle and accidents this tab is golden
Great battery life and easy to navigate!!! Great value!
it is easy for him to use. It has all the apps. that he wanted and can add more.
This is a simple tablet and easy to use. I would buy it again.
Had the HD Fire 6 and was disappointed that it did not have an SD slot. This one has the slot and has worked flawlessly. My kids love it. I bought 3 of them.
Got it for the kids lounge to stream movies. Will get the gaming remote so the can play games.
Initially I purchased this solely for the purchase of controlling Lutron lights. However, after being @ a friends house for a BBQ and watching them use this for music, I decided to give it a try to see if it could replace my Sonos.It can't, however, I've found that I'm much more likely to play Spotify through this using voice controls if I'm in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a Sonos to hit play/too busy to pull the phone out for Sonos app. This thing has also become more powerful as more IoT devices and services integrate with Echo or IFTTT. There is a TREMENDOUS amount of potential... give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know Alexa. You won't be sorry.
Works Great. My 3rd Kindle. Only complaint...they break
I like the 2 way camera. Took a while to get used to it. I had a very old Kindle so this is way better.
Got this as a gift. We have really enjoyed listening to different music and radio stations.
When someone is alone Alexia can be a substitute companion who happens to be very informative and helpful
Easy access to books and the web, just annoying ads.
This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small.
Great for kids or adults. Can't beat the price for what this tablet can do. Just as good as the more expensive tables, just need to buy extra memory
All apps I like for free, great video quality for Netflix, easy to order from Amazon site.
Plays loud good base and awesome item would recommend
Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
Wasn't what I thought it would be. Not a good investment.
Alexa answers questions, sets timers, plays music, she's great
I loved this kindle fire tablet. You can't beat the price. It's great for in the car and as a back up system. It's not as good as my kindle paper white, but like I said, great for a back up and it has other features that the paper white doesn't.
I have a bunch of sticks but to be honest, I like the box better. Runs much faster and less buffering
Love my Kindle! So when mother table died I brought her this and now I don't get calls all the time to help her figure out where everything is
Looks pretty solid will update review as soon as gift is opened .
Tablet is Worth for the Price. It is really fast in response.
This amazon echo is simply amazing and a must have for any person and it pairs we with the harmony remote simply wireless
My children really enjoy this tablet. We have tried other brand tablets and those were not too kid friendly, even though they were kid tablets, and I found them a little advanced for my children's ages. So this tablet was perfectly age appropriate, and with a bigger memory than the previous, no complaints.
Bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas she is going to love it I've already downloaded a bunch of book and apps for her so it will be all set for Christmas morning
I loved that the kids enjoyed it and I would be getting another one
I'm able to screen mirror from my tablet and android.
This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient.....
no problems so far.I am satisfied so far, however, it was just hooked up yesterday and I've only used it a few times.
This is my second purchase of an Amazon Echo. I use the Echo for everything from an alarm clock to a radio to a source for news and weather. It is an intuitive device.
My daughter loves this and uses it for her every day reminders and questions
Switched over from the 1st gen Apple TV to the Amazon one and love it! Cut the cable cord and am using PSVUE tv on this. Works great!!
Quick and easy setup impressed me. I bought this as a gift for my mom. Within 3 minutes she had the device registered, connected to her WiFi and downloading her Amazon book collection. Seeing the device made me want one for myself!
Easy to set up and works great right out of the boa
We love this fire tv as it has everything we need to watch movies and shows as well as fast streaming
Enjoy my tablet. Easy to carry in purse. It was a great buy. Love reading from it.
Not sure what to say about this except the jury is still out.
I love the Kindle fire. I have a nook from a few years ago and the Kindle has so much more. Very user-friendly, great price!
This was an easy purchase over the Internet and store pick up. I like the fire over the fire stick. You get more ram and can side load apps with micro SD card.
This product is awesome. You can play your favorite music instantly. Also had great fun asking Alexa questions. Some serious some funny. We love it!!
This was easy to set up. Easier to have your Hue lights already in place and then run "discovery". I watched You tube videos before setting up and it was not hard at all. Need to download the free app Amazon Echo. It connected with Philips hue lights. To connect with my nest thermostat I needed the IFTTT app. (Echo sends your command via the IFTTT app to nest. Thinking about getting another for other room.
Small enough to carry with me. I love how the pages turn with just a touch to the screen and I love the lit up background.
I like this .fun to play . Someone did a great job.!
Great tab for my kids. This is the third fire tablet that we have purchased for our kids.
Great product for a great price. Can't get any better.
Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
I got this to use as basically a speaker, but it does so much more! I use her all the time for setting timers, making shopping lists, turning off and on lights. We are adding more items to it slowly. We are adding more lights, the garage door opener, thermostats. So far she has been just great. My kids even enjoy asking her to tell jokes. I would recommend this to everyone. We love it!
Perfect size and features for my 9 year old daughter..fire is made well..she loves it to read and to play games on
I'd been givin'em as presents, and I'll do it again
Always worthwhile to have 2 or more.
Best bang for the buck! Although it may lack the processing power of the Ipad Mini, it has all the features and is 20% of the cost at $50.00. The battery lasts at least 5 hours of intense gameplay and video watching. I bought this primarily for my wife as a home entertainment device to replace her cell phone to watch video and check email, etc. She was not android savvy, but picked this up in a few days. I was very pleased to find it had Bluetooth! The built in speaker is what you would expect, small, mono and tinny. Although it isn't listed HD, at 7 inches an SD picture is razor sharp. Colors are bright, and the unit is light. Although you can't (without a hack- google it, wink wink) get google Play apps, the Amazon Underground has 10k FREE apps.You can also upgrade to 128 gb of external storage.Won't give it five stars as the sound without external speakers or headphones is weak, and the speaker is placed on the back, but would say 4.5 stars.
We love it! So much fun for everyone in the family! We happen to have The Nest thermostat after a few try's I figured it out! Played some of the skills with my Grandkids it as just great fun!
This is the second Kindle i have had. This has all the features that i need-It has my email, it is easy to read, it is easy to take wherever I go, it also has the books on it that i love to read. It has the further capability of taking pictures and has its own calendar. I recommend it to anyone.
Any one lower than this one is not worth it, and if you're a serious reader you will not put this down.
The picture quality is great.It's easy to hook up.
My Fire Kindle is wonderful and I use it all the time.
This is an amazing device for $50 . Nothing more to say!
If you want to cut the cable cord this the product needed!
I've had several kindles over the years and this is by far the best one yet! I love the paper white and will never go back to anything else. I use it everywhere! You will not regret this purchase!
Got this for my wife and she likes it. My boys love it even more! "Alexa, tell me a joke..." "Alexa how big is the earth?"But when this is integrated with Prime, it is fantastic. From playing all Prime playlists to music in my library. She keeps tabs on our grocery lists. Tells us the traffic. Weather. Movie time listings (and where.)"Alexa, Thank you." "You're welcome, glad I could help."
It works well for what I am using it for. To access shows.
She is a problem sometimes but getting better and our Alexa is learning as we speak to her more more.. fun
It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that.
The Amazon Tap is outstanding. There have been more applications slowly becoming avaliable. It is simple to use. It works with our Nest, which is a nice application.
I really enjoy reading much more. Especially like the rotate feature
I would recommend to family and friends. I love it.
Bought this tablet for my daughters to play apps on and to watch Netflix shows. It's nice that it has 2 cameras and expandable memory. Great price.
I purchased the Kindle Fire for my mom as a Mothers Day present, and she loves it.
Alexa has been amusing and informative to say the least. She is a wealth of information. She saves time and energy also.
Awesome we buy another one ASAP kelly was super helpful in helping me with all my problems...
I love this device. I won't have to worry about cable anymore.
I purchase this item for my daughter and she absolutely love the item and color.
If you love to read or want your kids to read, get this device, that's it.
Amazing the knowledge it has, Music so crystal clear.
So having this Amazon tablet for about a month or so it has its pros & cons let's be clear you aren't getting an iPad with amazing specs but you are getting an entry level tablet great for kids or for regular things like browsing the web & emails. the camera on here isn't really the best you're better off using a potatoe ha it's similar to the camera on the razor from back in the day. Watching videos on here is alright you aren't getting 1080p when I tired watching videos on higher resolution the videos would work correctly I think 720p was a little too much but then again could be my wifi connection but overall it's great for the price really easy to carry around & great for trips to keep any kid busy only thing I really didn't like was the ads on the home screen so for 50 sometimes even lower its a great pick really worth it ! remember it's a 50 dollar tablet compared to a 500-1000 tablet it's not going to be the same but it does get the job down (:
This Kindle reader with cover attached is light weight and easy reading. Page turner is easy to use and it reverses so you can hold with either hand. I am very happy and satisfied with this product. Happy reading -
This item is great! We have an apple TV for our other TV in our house but this item blows it out of the water. the ability to access so many additional things and apps is exactly what we needed. Plus being able to access the Amazon Prime music options and TV/Movie rentals makes it so we do not need to run to RedBox any longer.
much more powerful then the stick and the amazon fire tv 1
From latest news flash, to weather info, to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for Alexa to set a timer, the Amazon Tap is a fun tool to have around the house!
I was in the middle of moving and didnt want to get a new labtop and found this Amazon Fire for a good price. Ive been very happy with it. If your looking for a cheap easy to use tablet look no further.
Being used on a daily basis and never fails. Great product
Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
Lots of useful apps and options that give access to anything you could possibly want to watch.
His product is exactly what we thought it would be. No complaints
My Alexa is so awesome. While cleaning the house it's so easy just to say Alexa play… Without having to stop and search for the song in your playlist or choose and pick which songs you want. My housework can get done so much quicker now and is much more enjoyable.
This is my second kindle purchase. The first is still working fine just not backlit or paper white. The clarity is great, good size, and lightweight for extended reading. No bells and whistles, just easy and convenient reading.
This kindle is really good for the price. Screen is too small for me,but for my daughter it is perfect. Does a lot of cool things.
Not a huge fan of products that aren't Apple but this one is good. Haven't had any problems with them at all.
This helps my high schooler when she needs help with homework.
Very easy to use and cheap for its price. I would recommend.
This product meets all of my requirements and is very fast and easy to use. Locating and logging into other "public" WiFi systems was and is fast and easy.
Alexa is the best, she tells me the news, play my songs and ste the temperature of my home. I'm definitely enjoying the Amazon Echo.
very practical product if you read ebooks. thin and light.
This is a great streaming product. Especially if you already have Amazon Prime.
Got this to read on the train. Too Man ads. iPad only from now on.
My laptop broke so I needed something so for the price I couldn't go wrong.
This is a superior product. Easy setup, easy to use. Reasonably priced and great for the book worm who loves reading.
Got this over the google home because I felt it was more refined than the google's offering. Thwe most useful feature IMO is the ability to play music by just saying what you want to listen to not having to search through your own digital library or CD's. The other is the home automation which is great and very simple to use.
I purchased 2 Fire tablets for my kids. They love them. I should have reserved the prior, due to the fact that they are use to the android network. So it's taking some getting use to but the work and function just fine no problems yet, especially for the price
I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
The full size echo sounds great and is responsive. Setup is easy. I use it with Phillips Hue and Plum light pad. Works well. New "drop in" feature allows me to use the full size Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Show as intercom units.
Good reader; basic tablet; needs access to google play apps
I love my Roku but the Amazon Fire TV is the box to own and the price is right.
This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.
I gave this as a gift and have not herd how they like it as yet.
Fire , it does the job I wanted it to and that is to entertain my kid and myself. Nothing fancy and it does have it's quirks and bugs. Sometimes can be frustrating on response time with touch screen and loading.
Got this as a christmas present for a 5 year old. The tablet has an excellent kids mode that he can navigate easily to play games or watch videos.
Highly better alternative then the Fire Stick. Faster UI and perferomance compared to the Fire Stick.
Love being able to make my shopping list, listen to news. weather, playlists, and more. I am finding new ways , each day , to use it.
What a difference and got a super deal before Christmas. The new Kindle Fire not only does UHD with my monitor, the interface is really nice. I think it's much better than the Roku 3 I have been using and the Roku 4 that couldn't recognize my UHD HDMI port. It would only do 1080p. Plan to buy another to replace my Roku 3, for a 1080p TV. NICE!
I purchased 2 of the Amazon Fire and I am very pleased not only with the product but the price was fantastic. The children are thrilled and they have found it very easy to operate.
Great addition for reading on the go and shopping online. Compact and good battery life
I've been using a Kindle forever, and when it became apparent I needed an Android device (I have a Windows phone, which I love but has serious app limitations) I thought I with a Fire I could get a tablet and upgrade my Kindle at the same time. But even with Geek Squad help I could never figure out how to upload the apps I needed onto the Fire. So back it went, replaced with a Lenovo tablet that does the trick.
Its a good tablet for my 8 year old daughter. There are parental controls, and it can access the web.
This amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. Easy to operate even for a 3 year old.
Love the easy use of the system and the lots of books you can get from amazon
Tablets can get expensive, this one is pretty much everything you want in a tablet, but not for an outrageous price. Being Amazon, they make it user-friendly as long as you know what apps to get.
This is a great addition to any technological home. We don't use it all the time but we use it daily. It has a hard time recognizing my location when we ask for the weather, but we can ask for our city weather and we get it. We use the note taking quiet frequently for calling out what we need for groceries. It plays music that we ask. Now we must get some of the switches and plugs for controlling your lights and home automation. That will be a while, but it is still cool to know it is there as an option. Overall this is a cool toy for the whole family.
Great product easy to use. My niece loves it won't put it down.
Great price for a little powerhouse, tough tablet. This was given to my nephew (3 years old) and he is like a bull in a china shop but this little tablet has held up. It may not be the fastest or the best screen, but for small children or accident prone adults this is a great tablet. It does a lot, and Amazon controls for the younger set is quite powerful.
I wasn't really impressed. The remote broke within 1 hr of using it and had to return it.
My 3 year old grand child is loving this tablet. She is really catching on to using technology . She loves this and plays a lot of educational things that was available to her.
Now all 5 of my children have a kindle. This one is by far the best one.
My family loves the echo! They love to be able to request songs and dance their hearts away
Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly
I love the Fire. I can carry it in my purse plus I can read it anywhere. I took it on my cruise and every chance I had, I laid out on the deck and read books on it. It was a great buy!!
The echo is really fun and can do so much. The family loves it
This tablet has been wonderful for my 8 yr old son. The parental controls are perfect for making sure he doesn't purchase the wrong things.
Great streaming device, and at a fantastic price. Forget the fire-stick get the fire-tv
Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!
I like the color quality of the tablet and the size is perfect for at home or on the go.
My grandson had taken over his mom's kindle she got 2 years ago, so we decided to get her a new one and she loves it.
Perfect deal for Black Friday weekend. Easy to buy on line and pick up in store.
Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the "best "gift.
This tablet is so easy to set up and use. Very intuitive! Love love this device and all of my books can be transferred from my old version! Awesome
i am amused buy what i know of this and nowrealize much of what echo can do depends on how i research the resources and how much iinput information. the bluetooth possibilities are something i would like to know more of and how to use them.
I bought this for my grand daughter, she previously had a Nabi. I like the fact that she can use the hot spot on our phones and she can log on to view her favorite shows.My grand daughter is seven, but she also looks at movies and programs that her one year old brother can enjoy. The tablet is light enough to take along any where. It also has a protective shell which is a plus when you have an active seven year old.
As the community grows and more skills are added, this will have added value as time goes on. At this time, we see that companies like Nest, Ford, (well the list goes on) have developed a strong backing in this product. This won't be a fad, but a device we will have in all of our homes.
Bought for daughter who reads in the dark. She loves it!
I bought it for online streaming and its awesome, very convenient and easy to set up. Works awesome with WAN and LAN.
Great tablet with an even better price. Very affordable, sleek and has camera.
I love my new paperwhite. I can download books quickly and now read more books.
Works well and looks great for kids. Limited internet access though.
This is the right size to carry around. Really like this Tablet.....
Great tablet for kids my boys love their tablets!!
Super easy to use and very gentle on your eyes, I've tried many e-readers but I'll definitely stick to this one.
I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound
I bought this gift on black Friday as gift for my tech challenged mom. She really likes it it's easy to use and looks really good.
My wife uses the Tap mostly to listen to music. She loves the fact that she can take it into aNY room of the house. No more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.
Haven't try used it. It a Christmas present. Updated you later
Yes I like it my husband really like the way it work l like that it don't take up to much room
This is an item I use EVERY day! I bought one for my mother in law who is paralyzed and she loves it!
This is a great entry point into the tablet market. This was a purchase for my father in law and he really enjoys it. It is a bit on the smaller side but he wasn't sure if he would want a tablet. So far he really seems to be enjoying it.
I have stopped using my cable box 100%. We watch only a small amount of tv and this does it for us.
Great tablet for the price. My aunt is still loving it with no complaints.
I set it up but haven't used it yet. Not clear how to download books but I plan to learn that this weekend.
This is great for kids. Don't necessarily need to buy the more expensive kids version for a protective bumper. You can get the same apps & a better price tag. Just watch the charger port, kids can bend it if not careful.
Easy to use and set up. It is the best tablet for reading books or listening to audiobooks.
I bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an Ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.
I love the ease of setup and the accuracy of the voice recognition. My new favorite aspect of the product is building all of the rules and IFTT solutions that are available. What a great flexible product that is way more than a music speaker.
Great product for the price I paid. Highly recommended.
We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up
I wanted something simple for my Mom to use and this is perfect for her.
It's ok I would recommend it to friends for sure in the future
Easy setup..and for the price you get a solid company
Easy to set up. Great definition and apparently comes with a prime subscription.
Great device for reading books. Screen is super sharp and the backlight is great in low light. Highly recommend!
It's a great delivery vehicle for all your Amazon video and music needs. I bought it to watch PlayStation Vue (no more expensive Time Warner Cable for me!) It's built on Android OS so you can install Andriod apps. What I love about this box is that I can load my old school NES and SNES emulators and play them with the Bluetooth controller. You can also set up Kodi on it and you've got all kinds of movie, TV, music and gaming options using it. With micro SD card support and an extra USB port, this device is so much better than the TV Stick, and it's a lot speedier. Highly recommended!
Great purchase, easy to use. No longer need to use my iPhone for reading.
I cut the internet cord and I can't be happier!!! The Amazon Fire Tv offers so many apps and program options!! I wish I did this sooner.
Anti-glare is awesome. Clear and bright. Touchscreen is nice!
The screen size is good and the HD pictures are clear. I also like the camera photos. They are better than my cell phone camera. The size of the pictures are great. I would recommend this Fire HD for the ease of use.
love this tablet it was a great gift and it worked nice
This does everything i need and want it to do. All extras in one place.
it was mainly purchased for reading in dark. it does not irritate eyes when used in night without light
I have an IPad but thought I would buy this Black Friday to play around with and program to give to my Mother to enjoy.
I had just about every android box out there and this is my favorite. I hate the fire stick but love this.if you want something that works great get this.
this item is pretty loud for it's size but the commands that you tell it have to be pretty specific. for example, when you tell her to play some music you have to be specific as to what station and that it's on pandora. not amazing but pretty cool
Great item to have. Consolidate all your apps to watch shows. No issues at all.
Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it.
Perfect technology for my 11 year old son for games, reading, and homework.
This is a nice tablet for its price and size. Thanks!
Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
Got this as a tablet I would feel ok to lose. It is better than expected.
The echo is great for music, weather, and anything else you have integrated in the house.
Love using it! What I like best is the fact that more than one person can be registered.
I really like fire tv box it is user friendly and and I would recommend it to anyone I know.
I absolutely love Alexa (the wake-up name for the Echo). She tells me a funny fact every morning after I say "Alexa, good morning" then I tell her to play my favorite wake-up song(Good Morning Starshine) followed by the local weather and morning news. I get free music all day long from Amazon Prime and I can always hear a Chuck Norris joke. The sound quality is amazing, comparable to a Bose system and it was perfect for our last party. I get updates all the time for new stuff Alexa can do. I love my Echo and find it endlessly fascinating!
It's a wonderful tablet and e-reader for what you pay. My only complaint is it's a little laggy and the screen is sometimes unresponsive. I also don't like that I can't put my ebooks on my memory card. It's frustrating. Other than that, it's wonderful.
I have 2 my other paperwhite is a first generation and didn't hold up so well after the update. This one is great it's quick and brighter. I love the weight on it, doesn't seem flimsy. I got it for $80 will my discount, so it was a steal!! I love to read, I go through 4 to 5 books a week at the most!! I will be sure to put this thing through it, but I know it will be able to handle it!!Maybe next time I'll do the oasis!!
I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it
Cancelled my cable and i saved a lot of money from this..
Worth the money! Use it all the time with no issues!
I purchased this item on Black Friday and it did not disappoint me! Due to recently losing my previous Kindle Fire HD, I was seeking to purchase another. I came across the Kindle Fire and had to have it. It has an awesome display, great price, user friendly, and it is the perfect size for travel. I love it and would recommend it to anyone!
I was severely disappointed that the tablet has only 5.63 G when the packaging said it had 8 G. It was purchased because of the promised 8. It functions well, otherwise.
Love my kindle! At the price it is the best value in tech right now!
My amazon fire is amazing, it is fast and is durable.
Don't expect top of the line performance from this 50 dollar unit but it has really nice picture ok sound and good battery life. Shortcomings would be small memory causing laggy performance at times unless you keep your storage amount low on the built in memory.
I am a major reader and love that I can now carry hundreds of books with me so I can read whenever I want.
Perfect for traveling! wow they have lots of aps now glade I bought it.
My 3 youngest boys got these for Christmas and LOVE them!
Easy to read books and it holds a great deal. Ideal to take on a vacation.
Fast set up. Long battery life. Lots of options books. Music. Games..
Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
Love the tablet, not only for reading (upgrade from Kindle) but for searching the Internet, email, etc. And I can take it anywhere. Cheaper than an iPAD and does enough for what I need.
I purchased the Amazon Fire tablet for $33.00 during black Friday and it has exceeded my expectations. Once I cleared all the clutter of useless apps, I was able to set it up just right for my 13 yr old son. Would definitely purchases again.
I like that it has an Automatic backlight adjustment
Works great, as expected!
this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday
Light, easy to read, large capacity and multiple ways to turn pages. What else can I say, it's a wonderful reader, especially in the Florida sunlight. Also, the iPhone app that sync your ready progress is great for times you have your phone but not the kindle.
I recommend this and the Apple TV. They are both great products. I like the voice remote. Plus if you have Amazon prime. You can you Prime tv.
It's fun for the family to use Echo. Alexa has been of help to answer questions that the kids ask, many times related to their homework. Also, works great with 3rd party products, like Nest's. Will keep getting better and better over time, as more content/ data and integration becomes available for Alexa.
Very simple, very light and has all the basic features you will be looking for in a tablet but don't expect a fancy device
Streaming quality is great and nicely organizes media from Netflix, Hulu etc
I wasn't really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!!
We use our Echo to control our interior lighting, as well as to set a timer , playing music, getting the weather, and general information. Oh, and the shopping list is a great feature!
Love that I can talk and someone or something listens.. Haha..Great technology and the sound is amazing. Great price ..
The new kindle is a much better experience. It is lightweight, the back light and ink make reading easy. The internet connection is smooth and fast
If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!
It is pretty bright and the battery for this device last pretty long.
I love the paperwhite! It took me a long time to get used to an e-reader, but the paperwhite won me over. The battery lasts forever. It has a light so you can read in bed. Font size is adjustable. It's SO lightweight, and it feels good in your hand. Great on your eyes. Easy to use. You can bring all the books you want with you when you travel. I have an android tablet, and an ipad, and I prefer to read the kindle paperwhite. No contest!
I would have like Alexa to help me f8nd stuff in YouTube and other apps instead of typing it out though other than that it was an awesome investment
I like every thing about the tablet size , color, takes good picture's
I recommend this is probably product for those looking to make their home 'connected.' Can control lights, switches, appliances; can make a grocery list by speaking additions to your list. Can play music lists.
This is a great way to take a whole bunch of books on vacation without having to pack an extra bag for them. My wife and I put some on their for us too. And the reading surface is great, even in bright light.
very easy to use and has met all of my xpectations
It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news.
I ended up returning this tablet. For the price, $40, the tablet performed very well. However, if you have the money, do yourself a favor and step out of the Amazon lineup. The iPads are great, in my opinion the best, but they cost $$$$. From what I've experienced, the Samsung Tab A line is a solid tablet for a $$ budget. You can often find one on sale for ~$150 and its a pretty good bang-for-the buck.If the money is your ONLY concern, then this will probably work well enough for you.
I lost my first Kindle Paperwhite on an airplane and replaced it with the newest version. I transferred my account easily to the new Kindle keeping my entire library. Love it!
We have this to our kids as their Christmas gift. Not only were the apps good, but you're able to set up separate profiles for each user as well as usage timers so they don't get stuck on it for hours.
who would not love this product when it is so simple to use and you will get hours of enjoyment from it.
Any Kindle product I have purchased is easy to use
Love the Fire TV. It is fast and reliable. I have all my movies, tv shows and apps in one place.
My wife takes with her everywhere and always reads her books now with this
The Amazon fire tv is plug and play. Very easy to use
Great graphics! Great battery. Bought for my nephew and he loved it!
bought this for my grandson as i had bought one a year before for my other grandson. Great for younger ones
My kids like down games and play with. It is for young children if you don’t want spent a lot of money
A really nice tablet for a first time owner. Works great and has a decent sized screen
It makes reading at night much easier. Easy access to books that are of interest.
Affordable and kid friendly. My kids watch videos and play games on these a lot. Lots of apps, games and books to choose from!
Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again.
This is an awesome tablet for the price!! Works like the expensive ones for less!
This is such an awesome product… I highly recommend it – very easy to use and capable of so much!
Great table does everything that i need it for. Great resolution and screen for reading books
The Amazon Fire is excellent small compact, got it for my daughter's Christmas, she loves it. My daughter bought one for her grandfather which is 83 years old, he's doing good with it easy to use.
upgraded from a previous model and cannot be happier
It is very easy to use and i love that it syncs with my phone app for holding my reading spot.
I have a Roku as well and this is just as fast and has a comparable picture quality.
Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.
I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It's the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you
After rooting and placing play store on it I liked it more. Not bad for the price.
This isn't going to replace a tablet or an ipad, but if you're looking for a great display to read books and magazines, you can't beat this for 50 bucks.
It is awesome play pokemon and clash use silk its awesome great present
My girls love the tablet. It has lots of apps they can download. The only problem the battery is used up even when not in use.
One of the best Home Authomation in the business. i love how many features the Amazon echo has, and how it is still learning.
Pretty good sound for a mono speaker. Hears us clearly from many feet away. Use it to stream music from Pandora. Actually love this thing. We linked a really good blue tooth speaker to it and the sound is great. Be aware that you can only link one other blue tooth device to the Echo.
Got for a 4 year old solely for games has enough memory for kid apps
Bought it for my daughter as a gift. She was speechless
It's been prefect for my daughter to use for Netflix!
All of our kids - ages 4, 7 and 8 - have had their own Kindle Fire for almost two years. They're generally pretty careful with them since they've been told that broken Kindles will not be replaced. In one case, the Kindle simply stopped working - it would no longer turn on. There was a great deal going on so we did replace it. What a perfect product for a child! So many apps are available and they can learn new things while thinking they're just having fun. ;)
Both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that I bought one for each
The Kindle Paperwhite is a great e-reader. It is light and easy on the eyes.I like that not only is it easy to find and get books from Amazon but also from my public library.
Streaming videos finding anything you want all the apps you need. I guess I don't need cable anymore
Love the idea. but needs more resources for information. A lot of info that's out there that could be accessed
like the firs one that folds in prongs better
So easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it
Would buy again good resolution. Wish the screen was bigger
This is my second kindle & its lighter than the 1st, & nice to read my books on
I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.
Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend.
It was brought for my 67 yr old dad.....and he loves it.....
I am unable to connect with iPad Pro which limits one of the primary reasons for the purchase. I will appreciated recommendations to connect the devices.
Great for traveling on a plane. Use this item for games newspaper and listening to music.
I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BACK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017. I RETURNED THIS ITEM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF PURCHASE. I MAILED IT BACK PER INSTRUCTIONS BY AMAZON. TODAY MAY 26 I RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM AMAZON THAT THEY FAILED TO RECEIVE THE ITEM BY JUL. 20 SO THEY WILL CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD. I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT SOMEONE IN AMAZON RECEIVING DID NOT DO THEIR JOB LOGING IN THE ITEM OR US MAIL LOST THE ITEM. EITHER WAY I AM SCREWED.
Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store.
Amazon Fire tv is better then fire stick, roku 1,2& 3Streaming is too fast. You will not notice any delays
I really enjoy my Alexa. I use it for news briefs, listening to music and a playing games
Easy to navigate and my son just loves it pkus a year free of service.
awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies
Tho she wouldn't make herself real for me, this is a nice gadget.
For all it can do at this price level is amazing. Makes great gift too
The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
Really enjoy our day to day interactions with Alexa
I went into store to inquire on differences between Apple TV models. Sales person answered my questions but also suggested I consider FireStick. educate yourself before purchasing.
I bought this Kindle as a gift for my brother. I already have one and love it so much I wanted him to have one too.
If this is your first tablet I would recommend it. If you've ever had an iPad and would stick with the iPad and pay the extra money, even for an older one. "You get what you pay for".
Works great and I haven't had any issues. Easy to use.
Love the Echo ! Awesome tone to the sound ! Very easy to use I can use this paired thru Bluetooth with my iPhone or I can simply ask Alexa questions. I can access my music from my Spotify or Spotify in general and various other sources. my only recommendation for new products would be to have this be able to be on the charger and then portable not connected to a Wall outlet like the smaller version can be on the charger. However I had the smaller version first and the tone quality and volume were not that great plus i had to get up go across the room to tap it to change anything or ask it anything. the echo you can just talk to it across the room which makes it really easy for you to be lazy ha ha:) I received this as a birthday gift and I really am enjoying it ...highly recommend it!
Got this tablet for my kids and couldn't beat the price for a tablet reader. Kids watch movies and play games on this
I love my fire... The games and the pictures great
This Kindle is great for the price. However, there are some downsides to paying for a $50 tablet. The battery life goes very quickly, so daily charges are necessary if you're a heavy reader. You also can't save anything of merit like books or magazines to a mini-SD card, thus making a purchase of one a waste of time and money.
Really nice. Small enough to cary in a purse or brief case. Easy to use and lighting is good. Just need to buy a case to protect the glass.
when I compare the screen of this voyage to my previous paperwhite, the qualify of the display was much better. light is more even and soft.
Got this on sale for a great price and is a great product.
Bought this for playing music, but am learning that it can do so many things. Love it.
I definitely love using the echo and it makes certain tasks a lot easier
I'm a prime member and I bought 3 amazon Tv, if I have more rooms I would buy more
I bought the table as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old. Perfect for children or beginners. Decent speed, only complaint is the camera (very bad quality camera)
I love this item because I just love all electronics
Great for puzzles and games, especially for the price
I love my kindle! It never runs out of battery. Used it on a three week detachment and never had to charge it.
I bought this for my 9 year old. It perfect for playing not to heavy games and for reading. The only down side is that not apps are available in the amazon App Store. Others than that not bad at all. Also side loading the no available apps don't work all the time. If your looking for something to surf the net and watch movies on, then this little table is perfect for you.
love the item. many features and variety of options. recent and old programs and movies. i can now look at a whole series at once.
This charger is improved from the other one I had. It takes less time to fully charge and the charge lasts longer.
Our kids even enjoy using the Echo. It's been very entertaining for our family. We do get more music preferences with Amazon Prime membership.
I purchased this for my fiancee for her Christmas present and she loves it. It's got great picture quality, excellent audio and great response/reaction time!
New exactly what I wanted dot dot dot and I always buy from Best Buy when I get the opportunity
Good for your kids at 50.00 bucks wont hurt that much when your kids accidentally break it or damage it.
First one had issues from the update that was loaded upon installation. Returned and waited several weeks before buying a replacement. Seems to work better.
other than not being voice activated like the Echo, it's just as good if not better
I wasn't sure how the tablet would work out but getting this tablet was a great idea. And the price was awesome!!
The kindle is great for general, all-purpose use of a tablet/e-reader.
This product is very amazing it fast to answer and it does so much more...love it...
This tablet works well for anyone. It however does have a few quirks. When trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else. But other than that it's fast & very clear & bright screen.
You need gooooood wifi for this. If the wifi isn't good like it's in and out this will not work that good. You also need the app to set up alexa. I would only recommend this if you have great wifi
This is the perfect companion for stay at home bodies. Very informative, helpful and entertaining. The speaker is good for a stand alone unit.
Although a cheap tablet with amazon functionality it's a very slow one.
Great price. Very Easy to use. My grandson loves it.
Great alternative to iPad Mini. Great for Amazon Prime members
My wife had an older Kindle but this one had so many improvements: great paper white reading appearance, longer battery life, and it lights up so she can read in bed.
My granddaughter loved her tablet and the color. It's amazing how easy it is for her to use, perfect birthday gift
It was a gift. I was told that it is very fast. Easy to use, and a lot of available apps.
Lol.... the only reason i bought this tablet was so i could load my games from my phone and play them on larger screen but i didnt realize that sonce its an amazon product it wont load google play or support vlash of clans or any other google game a big thumbs down.... i guess im just stuck with a tablet that is useless for me
No buffer, quick respond, and awesome remote control.
Purchased kindle paperwhite after my kindle touch of three years fell and broke. I love the light on the paperwhite and that I no longer need to use a separate book light. The light is adjustable, which I love because when I'm reading in the dark in bed, just a little light is needed. Great price and great product
Gift for my mother in law she really liked it but it heats up a little to much.. it's good overall
This device, which has the latest version of artificial intelligence, is the smartest one I've seen yet. While security questions are a hot topic, I have learned how to mute the device when necessary. Don't let that stop you from having the best multi-use device on the market. Did I mention it has a great wireless speaker too?
This is a gift to my daughter, she likes to play games and web browsing with it, and she is very happy with this tablet.
best buy matching prices was great it did match the price offered by other vendors thats why i always go to best buy for all my gadgets need
A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled.
I bought this product for my father. He's loves it. It's very helpful
I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster.
The Echo is a great product. You can ask it anything. I can not even to begin to list everything it does. If you have a tech savvy house the sky's the limit.
I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet
Was please to find out that a camera, albeit not real high in pixel density but still usable, was now available along with a memory slot. Older model died and was getting real slow due to not enough memory. Good for a book reader, not so for a full featured tablet.
I didnt realize, even though I should have, that I could not add whatever programs I wanted to for it. I wanted to get this so I could play games on the tablet while home, instead of my phone. I was able to install one of the two games I play, but was unable to with the second. I will actually be returning it because that means I have no use for it. My wife has one and hers has been great for her this entire time.
Lots of fun, but also very useful. Have it connected to my Nest Thermostat and going to connect it to my Caséta Wireless switches. The speaker has great bass for its size. Search YouTube videos for tips and tricks. It does more then you think,
like it works for what i need for my son very easy to use and
Good size with very good weight. You will love the gentle backlight if u read in a dark area. Best buy was one that had it as same price as Amazon. Just excellent!
This is such a great product I have two of them! Would highly recommend.
THOUGHT I GIVE IT TRY,SO FAR IT DOES THE JOB FOR WHAT I NEEDGOOD FOR THE PRICE!
this is such a nice tech thing even the kids can operate and nice for the Google challenge
My granddaughters love the Kid Kindles that they received for Christmas!
Read Kindle books daily and had been utilizing my iPhone and IPad to read but neither of these are conducive to reading in the sunlight. SO I bought myself an early Christmas present and love the ease of use and the ability to read while outside in the bright sunlight. Worth every penny!!!
So, after visiting my sister and brother in law who use an Amazon Echo to run just about everything in their house, I just had to have one. I purchased my own Amazon Echo the minute I got home from my trip. I am now on my way to building my smart home. My wife and I have enjoyed using Alexa to help us with recipe measurements, check the weather for the day, set reminders and play our favorite music.We are now working toward building and buying items such as wifi light switches, a smart thermostat and a few other items that will all work seamlessly with Alexa. It will take a while to get it all done but it is a lot of fun!! The Amazon Echo is such a blast to use. Take your first step in building your smart home with the purchase of an Amazon Echo!
This is a really great upgrade from the regular Kindle, however, it's not such an appealing product after Amazon updated the base Kindle to the same hi-resolution screen. May be worth waiting to see if Amazon upgrade the Voyage over the coming months.
I purchased this tablet as a gift for my son who is always up on any new books or games. He loves it and is always thanking me for getting it for him. The clarity and colors on the screen are amazing. This is a very good product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying a kindle.
I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....
I bought two fire tabs for my kids on thanks giving... the were excited about it and liked it a lot... lots of games, movies and pretty good stuff for them.
Can't live without this, use for email, banking, social media, reading, watching movies, tv shows, online college courses. Even prints to wireless printer.
I am not impressed at all I think you should save your money and get a smart watch instead. This is a expensive item and doesn't do enough for the money you spent. The weather timers adding things to your calendar that's just not enough half the things you ask her she said she doesn't understand
The selling point for the purchase of this Kindle was the ability to read in low light situations.
I love this product. Easy to use. Functional. Great
Bought it as a gift for my mom and it's simple enough to get done what she needs
Such an amazing product. Sounds great and works perfect.
My 3 year old love it.. Cool apps and easy to use!
I bought themail kindle for my daughter to use at school. It was very convenient for her. She was able to do her assignmentshe off of it.
I do like the kindle for reading at the beach and it is very portable.
Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...
Plays great music and hears you from pretty far away. Simple to set up and makes life a bit easier. New skills being added keeps it new and exciting!
Bought this for my Dad in a senior living facility. He loves it and uses it daily to answer questions and listen to music.
This is a great little kids tablet. Has a lot of features and is really fun to use.
My 2nd kindle so it meets my expectations better than my very old one.
Great product would highly recomend this. Sales person was really help full
Great apps,ease of use,love the 8in screen, camera not that great, better pics on phones
Great product. Great performance. Skills take some getting used to but lots of possibilities.
The product is cheaper than the kid version but works the same. It is a great product from Amazon. The camera is so so but entertaining the kids are great.
Love my Kindle. It has taken over the place of my laptop completely with all other added benefits.
I had the kindle keyboard before and got the paper white for Christmas and really like. I can read I any light I no longer have to have a light attached to my kindle to read before bed. Pretty simple to use.
I purchase this tablet for my daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it I am very pleased that she's not able to get online or to get on YouTube and watch crazy videos which she previously did with other tablets we have you actually get to pick the games and books to put on it you manage everything from the parent account and it is locked with your personal password and the kids can't get into it. I would say the only downfall is you cannot download anything from the Google Play store since it is an Amazon tablet.
The Echo is easy to use but some features require a lot of work. It is easy to set up for playing music. The other features(skills) require some study to get the most out of the product. After a few months I am still learning something everyday about the Echo. Long learning curve but a fun product.
it does what its supposed to do, turn ur tv into a smart tv altho chromecast has the upper hand because of its lack or chuggy connection to mobile phone
I bought this product to add to my TV in the family room. Great buy
Amazon Echo helped me to make my home smart.Apart from turning on and off the lights. one can enjoy alexa company!!
It's a nice looking cover, will keep the Fire clean, but not particularly safe in a fall. (I have the black one. It is very professional looking.) No padding whatsoever. It does wake the Fire up when opened (and shut down when closed) but that has never been important to me. My problem with all of the cases is that you have to hold the cover out in order to keep the camera clear and it makes clicking the shutter a little awkward. I'd like to see an opening on the front cover that matches up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject.
Bought this as a gift. It was a great buy! Lightweight, great look, easy to use, great sound! I would highly recommend this product.
Great price for a decent tablet. Amazon hit it out the park with this tablet.
I bought this for my Granddaughters 10 th Birthday. She was thrilled. She loves the blue color and even figured out how to connect it to her cell phone.
So many great things to say. This product is awesome and can be configured to do so many things. I use it for my morning briefing of hot news, sports and weather. I also use her to turn on/off my theater system and NEST thermostat. Would highly recommend. Even the novice can configure and use this prodcut. You are only limited by your imagination. Just do your homework. There are many many automation options. You need to figure out the best brands and products for your lifestyle.
Love our Echo. It has great sound quality. Very helpful with conversions when baking.
I do not find this as easy to use as my original Kindle Fire but I do like the camera a lot better, though it is not clear megapixels
What a deal I got this Black Friday specially for a kid who loves reading
you get what you pay for, great little device for very cheap. this would have been a high end tablet a few years ago. to get one for sub 100 and not have it be a p.o.s. tablet from some no name branch is amazing. i use it as an ereader, for games, for second screen when watching movies or playing xbox, etc. great battery, included ads are unobtrusive, really only notice them when they appear on unlock screen or when it makes book recommendations. none of which i mind to save fifteen bucks on the unit. highly recommend. if you lose it or it breaks you barely spent anything on it and just get another one. the microsd support is really nice too
Not very functional and never had all the answers I needed. And I wanted a device I could make phone calls to anyone with in which the Google home does. We purchased the Google home and we are so glad we did.
Great tablet Easy for a child to use Price is right and size
I would recommend buying this. Worth the money for all you get.
I love my amazon TV. It works great for my needs and I can also enjoy playing games on it.
It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. The Silk Browser seems to have issues with search engines. Just switching the search engine fixes it though.I got this for when the power goes out at my house. It's served to let me watch netflix. With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it. So for the most part it's a good solid low end tablet.
We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
I got this for my nephew, He loves it I have also got them for my mom and myself. they are fabulous, the price is so low.. you can really do a lot with it.
The Amazon Echo is worth purchasing. I wish it could access a wider variety of music and information.
Great reader with incredible battery lifeWould Def buy again
At $50 it's worth getting if you have Prime or just use Amazon a lot. At $40 (on sale right now) it's a bargain. There's only one thing about it that's somewhat of a drawback: not very good battery life. But keep it in an area with a strong wi-fi signal and use Airplane Mode when you don't need wi-fi, and you'll only have to charge it every night. Seriously--every night.
I have been enjoying my echo for about a month. I enjoy using it for Pandora, flash update, and general things like weather, and information through Wikipedia. There is room for improvement in services, but that is being addressed with new skills being added. Generally, I like it.
Good e-reader, with an improved design, light-weight
I am having so much fun with my Echo, from playing music to asking her questions like the weather to asking her to tell me a dumb joke.
I love kindle paper white , as it is lightweight , and the feeling is the same as reading a book because of the background color ,
Great entertainment. possibilities endless.I love it
If your a amazon member get this you'll not regret it.
AWESOME LIL TABLET I BOUT THIS FOR A CO WORKER AND THEY LOVE IT
Best electronic item in house. Great purchase. Good
Fast and easy to use. Interface is user friendly. Even my kids had no issue using this device. No lags for me. Connected wired and seems way faster than the stick. Definitely recommend this item.
If you are as invested into the Amazon ecosystem as I am, you can never have too many of these.
I baught the amazon echo after researching the different smart speakers out in the market. It is able to control my Sony 4k TV with just voice commands and it's great to be able to listen to pandora just by asking Alexa.
The Fire TV is everything I could have asked for in an entertainment system
Bought 2 for family. They love them. Good Birthday gifts!
Love that I can get answers to history questions, But especially love the fact that it plays any song that I ask of it.
This speaker is great and not only is it a speaker but it's got the Alexa application!
When looking at kindles, I was debating between the paperwhite and the regular kindle that was a bit cheaper. So happy I spent the extra money for the paperwhite. Having the backlit screen has been such a life savor and great feature. I loved it while camping and is also nice when reading in bed because you don't need to have a light on waking up the other person. I absolutely love this version and recommend it 100%!!!!
This is undoubtedly the best Christmas present this year.
Small and compact but great for reading books and gaming. Will try Netflix down loads next.
Inexpensive alternative to standard Kindle e-readers.
I had an old (non-backlit) Kindle and loved it. When this one went on sale I bought one for my son (an avid reader like me) and he liked it so much I bought one for my wife next time it went on sale. I was going to get one for myself but the sale ended. I forgot about it, just kept using my old Kindle. Then lo and behold it went on sale again so I ran out and finally got one for myself. Keep in mind my primary use of it is as an e-reader and for that I can't imagine a better device. I can also pop online and check my email etc but I only do that when I'm on a secure WIFI (e.g. at home or a friends; I don't use hotel etc even if there is a 'password' because shared WIFI's are insecure). So for $40 it can't be beat.
Fantastic Kindle. Worth it for the back light. Wife uses it everyday especially when rocking our new born in the dark
I love my amazon fire tablet, I'm sure my kids will love theirs too!
Any Alexa speaker is a great investment but this one to me is the best. Works as a stand alone speaker but can also be plugged into things such as sound bars. Easy to set up
This is a great product. Great sound. My entire family enjoys this
I purchased these for my grandchildren, ages 3 to 9. Not a lot of power/performance but great for the kids. They have downloaded books from amazon and viewed movies on Netflix. One downfall was my Grandson could not connect his tablet to his MiP's robot he received for Christmas. Would not recommend this tablet to those seeking computer performance like that of the large more functional tablets like Samsung Dell and others
It actually works.. Programmed my harmony and hue lighting!!! Now only if she made coffee in the morning!!!
Good tablet for the price works like it should with good battery life
FireTV is the best streaming device. This model have Alexa 
easy to use really bright screen easy to see. worth the money
A great e-reader have had no problems with it at all.
Purchased for one of my granddaughters and she loves it. The price was right and it works great.
lightweight and easy to read indoor or outdoors no light to full light.
My son has the Hd fire used for last 3 years, I bought this one for my moms birthday. She loves it. It's easy to navigate and the ability to increase the size of the print allows for the smaller screen cheaper price :)
Got this for my 3 year old due to it having the bumper and I will tell you it's well worth it. I couldn't tell you how many times its been dropped and survives every time.
I love the kindle fire. I have an I pad but I love to read on my kindle. The size is great, I like to read at night so my kindle makes it much easier. My grandson also plays games on it. It is a great product.
I have a disability, an it is hard to do thing with alexa she help me
The paperwhite was excellent at first but just yesterday (Feb. 22), less than 2 months since I purchased it, it froze and nothing I do will work. I am taking it back to Best Buy and hope they can fix it.
Well almost no more cable. We still need the internet but with this fire tv we get to watch all our stuff using our amazon prime account and saved us a couple of hundred a month. Purchased with HD antenna so we still get all our local channels. Highly recommend. There are other things that can be done that can give you more options.
I will never pay for TV programming ever again. I love my fire stick
Great tablet for the money. I mostly use it to watch Netflix or Hulu movies and read books on Hoopla. The picture is great and suits my needs. The sound is not the best but its okay.
Very good product with many new features each week. Good learning tool for young children with teaching mathematics, history etc.
Great tablet at a great price. lots of good features
Bought this for my daughter n she loves it!! So glad I got it for her
The tablet periodically shuts off for no reason. I have contacted Amazon but their only suggestion was to reset to factory default.
Good tablet for the price! Quality brand and service
Best Buy makes it easy. No problems. I am a Best Buy Geek.
I got the first version for my sister and she hasn't been able to put it down on over a year. Then I got her this one and forget about it. Great new features, she loves loves loves it!
Good for leisure/reading for fun. Not for students.
Amazon fire tab is good for begineers or for kids. Memory and disk gets occupied soon. Suitable for fewer apps.
The amazon fire HD is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person!
It was everything I expected it to be. Very pleased. I would recommend this product and your store to everyone I know.
I would recommend the Fire Tablet to anyone. IT is very easy to set up, download apps and use. Movies are crisp and clear.
Not really much to say here but it does the job. I'm not use to the Amazon store as I am with the Google store but I can live with it. This was a spur of the moment but where I wanted something to take on the plane and not spend a lot. And so far it has been my traveling buddy. For the price it is good and does what it should without to many compromises; ( ads) if your not looking for a lot nice stop.
Reliable, price efficient device. Easy to use for all ages.
The tablet was great, the performance and the price is excellent.
Works as expected
I bought this after already having a fire stick and this outperforms it.
Great for streaming music, weather forecasts, sports updates, news briefings, etc. Works as advertised. Only drawback is not as knowledgeable as the google home. Has some limitations, but works great with suggested applications.
Very good picture and it even takes pictures which is awwsome. You even get a free month of Amazon prime which came in very handy around Christmas Time
Lots of fun and educational- you can learn a lot and save the walking by talking to this device
It's great to read either in the day or at night. It's light and has nice feeling of touch. My friends bought their kindle long time ago, and I just got mine. The design and everything is better and better. I love kindle paperwhite than the basic one. I would highly recommend it to my other friends if they don't have one.
Really love this product it's fast portable and we can stream all our favorite shows.
Overall I like the fire TV.The UI could be a better,it could be better organized and easier to navigate.It also pushes Amazon video over other streaming services.Doesn't have as many streaming services as Roku.
The automatic light adjustment is pretty cool, but I find myself accidentally covering the sensor which really throws it off.I like being able to press the buttons on either side instead of touching the screen. I also appreciate the flat surface, it doesn't seem to attract as much dust in the corners like my other kindles.
I started out crazy hesitant about the product seeming skeptical of the voice recognition being overdramatized. It hears me while a song is very loud. As well as the information pre-downloaded is awesome. Just for music alone it's awesome. Everything else, which is not able to be explained is far beyond worth the money. It's an underpriced item and I plan to buy 1 more.
Swiping had to be repeated several times sometimes to get the action to respond. Returned.
I really love my kindle fire. It's my second one. It's convenient and has so many functions.
This is a great tab for a price. I was looking for a inexpensive good tab it serve the purpose.
Wonderful educational tool for my niece with special needs.
I needed a good tablet for my niece and my nephew.
Got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! The volume is great!
I love the Fire Tv box, it offers the voice recognition remote and an ethernet input if your WIFI happens to be shotty.
It is reasonably priced so you can replace if need be. The small size is perfect for kids especially when travelling.
Great tablet for kids, inexpensive and reliable. Sturdy and kid friendly.
I love streaming tv with this device works very smoothly have had no glitches whatsoever
We debated in getting the larger or smaller screen and I'm glad we went with the larger one. My son uses it every day and loves it!
Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!
I love this tablet primarily for reading. It's inexpensive, portable, and light weight. It has great features, but it's on the slow side when browsing the web. Overall I'm super happy with my purchase.
Good kindle not much different from the other ones. Worked exactly how I expected it to.
Works as it should. Finally cut the cord! No more cable bills!!!!
Good reads with my new paperwhite kindle. made my reading experience great.
Tablet could use a better speaker otherwise a great tablet
It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!
What I expected
This is a very nice Tablet and for the Price I think is a great Price/performance ratio. Enjoying it very much so far. The only con so far is that does not come open to Access google play store, though there are some work arounds. Nice size and excelent resolution for ocasional streaming.
Pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker. Easy to set up.
Easy to use and great resolution for viewing high definition content
I have owned three versions of the amazon echo: the original, the dot, and the tap. This is the most versatile of the three. The wireless recharging is great. The sound is not as good as the original, but the portability makes up for this. At $79 it was a fantastic buy.
My husband gave this to me for our vacation to Hawaii. It was nice and lightweight to read on the plane in the dark, and on the beach in the bright sunlight. Love it!
I have multiple fire devices in my home. They work great and allow me to access tons of content from 4K down to SD.
Learning how to stream movies from Netflix and my amazon prime my wife and I are really enjoying my fire tv.
She is great at controlling hue lights and harmony hub. Voice command smar home!
Great purchase and good investment.Also wonderful viewing
I bought this for my daughter as a replacement from a broken tablet it's very easy to use for my child
I love it take a little getting use too.Alexa is very nice she your own personal assistant ask her anything . But first u have to give her skills which are in the app.
much faster than previous model, screen is super crisp and readable. No jaggies on the text.
I feel like it plays the same playlist every time.
Bought this as a gift so I don't know much about it. Seems nice though
Not an exact fit in our house , but an excellent speaker . Worth learning to use .
Tablet is a good tablet not the best for games or apps but decent especially for the price
Good tablet if you are looking for one thet doesn't cost alot. Amazon has a nice app market as well
This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in, makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability
Already lost the cord. It should be longer so u don't forget it. Especially on vacation.
The tablet was a great fit for my 21 month old toddler. She is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance. I like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps.
Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.
I like this item it suits my needs.
Amazon Fire HD 8 Tablet: With a vivid 8 touch screen and access to Amazon Underground, this tablet makes it easy to watch movies, play games or catch up on your reading with personalized recommendations. Cloud storage offers simple access to your content from anywhere.
Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.
I bought this as a gift for a family member and she loved it. Great simple tablet.
Awesome good size large enough for games and photos
Have you ever thought...make sure to add this (t.p., eggs, shampoo, whatever) to the grocery list? With Alexa, I can just say "Echo (which is what we named ours), add shampoo to the shopping list" Voila! It is added to the list, which is then accessible to both myself and my husband on the app we have on our phones. I don't have to stop what I have moved onto to find the list, something to write with..you get the picture. Same thing for the to do list. We also have it connected to lamps which is ideal for my Mother who is wheelchair bound and can't reach switches. She just says, "Echo, turn on sofa lamp" and Voila! the light is on.
Excellent device, wish I had bought the bigger one.
I'm a big fan of Amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. The build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. Worth the price.
Kindle is the perfect E-reader. Easy to use and size is perfect to bring 'book' on the go.
Love my Amazon Echo- use it everyday! Also like Echo Dot for telling me the weather everyday.
The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet
good value for the money, love the kindle for reading
The protective rubber guard works so well. Easy parental controls
It was one of the best purchases I have ever made!
This is a very well made tablet. If you can deal with the Amazon pre loaded apps, it is very fast. Simple to use and the best tablet for the price.
Hey--It works. I prefer to get a battery recharge direct from the source instead of from my computer. The cord is convenient.
I bought this for my aunt to play games and be able to use Facebook. She loves how easy it was to setup and use.
They love it and when they are here that's all they want to do but I do limit their time on it.
Quick answers, cooking conversions, jokes, shopping lists, uber calls, weather, it does everything
I saw that Best Buy had a great deal on this and I was looking for a smaller sized tablet for all the Kindle books I have bought or ordered. The item shipped pretty quickly and I did have issues setting it up but once I got through that I fell in love. I quickly downloaded my books to the Kindle and surfed online with ease. This was a great deal!
This was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves loves loves it!!!
Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for
Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use.
Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show, 1 Echo, 2 dots, and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say "Alexa" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!
i bought this for my friend and he loved it. He was looking forward to this a couple of years ago.
I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.
My 84 year old father has no issues with it and is very intuitive.
This tablet was affordable and it's pretty decent.
I chose the Paperwhite primarily because of the backlighting. I also own an original Kindle that does not have this feature. I love the new Paperwhite! I recently used it on a long trip and truly enjoyed the convenience and ease of use. I loved the fact that I did not have to turn on another light to read!
Love the kindle product have purchased several kindles and several types and this is another great product. this model doesnt have the auto dimming feature that i like on previous model but still a great kindle
Fire TV streams shows and movies without buffering at all
Very easy to use. Purchased it watch Amazon Video and to use my Playstation Vue account. Works well with both.
Got this mainly to watch Sony vue tv. Just got sick. And tired of cable and satellite prices going up and up. Lots of other neat stuff you can do with this also. Prime. Is also great source
Bought on Black Friday for a Christmas present and it has been worth every penny!
got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied
I absolutely love my echo because I am lazy to log on my computer to ask google. Also I get multi use of it as my personal Pandora music box. The only downside to this is Alexa can't hear you if your room is big because of echoing in the background....also I forgot her name once and had to walk next to her to turn her off. Other than that...I love her!
Great eReader. The PagePress feature is so much better than swiping to turn pages. My only complaint is that I had to turn the auto adjust light feature off as it doesn't seem to reasonably adjust based on where I am reading.
Great product, works as expected. Cool features, my kids love it.
We like it!! Would buy again.Still learning about it's features. Good value
Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
Well worth the investment. Picture quality is on par with Verizon FiOS. Purchased 2 units. One used wirelessly the other via LAN connection. Without a loop, picture quality very similar. Highly recommended.
This item is awesome for streaming movies or sports
Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.
Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.
Has a great alarm clock functionality -- know that sounds silly but it's awesome to be able to set your alarm with your voice. And you can play music before bedtime and put on a sleep timer, which is awesome.The news roundups in the morning are also nice for while you get ready.Interested to see where it goes!
This is an amazing product. Got it for my dorm and I love it.
i love the service when it works. several times it had to be reset and now it's finally dead. i've had it less than a yr now...
Easy to sync with my account. Love the size and ease of use
So, at first, I wasn't sold on this. I bought it mainly to act as voice control for my Lutron lights on our first floor and I already had Pico remotes throughout, so it didn't get used that much. Then, it kind of clicked with some simple things like setting timers and playing podcast. Then, it got more natural when I connected the Alexa app and the Logitech Harmony app with IFTTT. Next thing you know, my wife and my son are both using it as we're coming and going to turn the lights off and on, turning on the TV, turning off when it's time for dinner etc etc. Really excited for the upcoming Sonos integration... All in all, this was a very worthwhile purchase as it's become a really strong platform for home automation and it only looks like it's going to get better.I think it's safe to say that the Echo means different things to different people... if you're into HA, then don't hesitate!
This item is great! It is better than the android boxes online.
Great Christmas gift for my son. Best tablet ever.
I like the kindle fire for all the free games you can get on it. I wanted it for a long time and during the holiday season, I found it on sale and I bought it!
Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away.
I got this for my girlfriend as a Christmas present, and she hasn't been able to put it down.
The Touch cover from Amazon has some good and some bad properties.On the good side, it's very light: at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions. I definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the Kindle. However it does look rather cheap. For 40 I was expecting a little more.I think I am going to have to use this for a while before reaching a final conclusion.Update November 29th: Tastes will vary, but in the end I decided that this was not the right look or feel for me and I have switched to a different cover (the Splash SAFARI). That is similar to the old Kindle 3 cover, with a textured leather appearance and an elastic fastener strap.
Great piece of hardware for the price - maybe needs a slgihtly better app selection, but 4K compatible and microSD card slot makes this a a great device for streaming video.
I love Apple, but this product is so much better than Siri, and really great for smart homes.
My Son Loves His Tablet That Santa Got Him For Christmas
Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
Purchased three tablets for my kids and I have not been disappointed. I am considering purchasing two more.
My son loves this tablet!! He's 13 yrs old and this thing does everything. Great battery life also
With knowing not much about Amazon (since I don't use the website much), this is a great first tablet. Easy to use and navigate.
This is a great addition to my expanding smart home. The speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive.
The kindle was bought for my grandchildren that also have iPads. I don't have to worry so much about them breaking it and being out all the money for an iPad.
Maybe it's because their older or have had other tablets, but this was the easiest setup ever!
I had one of the original Kindles and gave it to my daughter when I got an iPad. As much as I love my iPad, it's not ideal as an E-reader. After a trip or two this summer to the beach with a good old fashioned paperback, I figured I'd try out the New Kindle Paperwhite. I'm so glad I did! It is small, lightweight, and holds a charge for days! I love it, and have been reading book after book since my purchase.
There is absolutely nothing that I don't just love about my kindle. The built in light is a nice addition that my old kindle didn't have. I would highly recommend the kindle paper white .
I didn't find the e-reader easy to navigate and actually found it confusing. I have an older model and that one is easier to navigate. The new one was skipping pages sometimes also.
Tab is good and fit for my req and battery life is also gpod
I like it personally but still there are some improvement required
As a full time student, I wanted a budget tablet that would let me read pdf files, open class notes and powerpoint presentations. I got the fire 7 when it was on sale for 39.99. It does what I wanted and more. I use it for class and to kill time between classes with games, movies, and youtube. Battery will last two days of constant use, the size is perfect and fits my pant pocket (back). Overall great buy. Only downfall is the volume to my headphones, I found it to be quite low, but for the price, good enough.
I DON'T USE MUCH OF THE APPLICATIONS BUT IT WORKS FOR THINGS I NEED.
We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value.
I have a 2014 Kindle HDX and I brought two of these. One for my daughter and one for my husband. I love the new features. I will be buying one for me in the very near future. Great inexpensive price Amazon !!! Thank you for showing that better doesn't have to be extremely pricey. I also love the fact that you added a memory slot. Added 64GB to both. Thank you. Highly recommended!
Better than the firestick, works well with prime and simple to use.
50 buck will get you this ipad wannabe. Is it awesome? Meh. Will it satisfy your urge for a tablet? Maybe... A good gift? Probably
At an awesome price and great tablet! Works like a phone, so easy for smaller kids
It's a great tablet for beginners. It's not ran off gb. So my teen have to have wifi. No bill
The Amazon warranty of this product is great for a reason, it needs to be because they have to keep replacing it. I had two that died within weeks and every single one has broken the screen.
I have had a kindle for a long time. I chose to upgrade to the Paperwhite. I am very happy with my decision
I am enjoying this refrigerator, so far we have no problems with it.
I bought this tablet for my goddaughter and it was definitely a great buy! Kid friendly and she has all the books and games she's interested in as well.
I'm in my 50s and sat this up easily. I mainly use it to play music and news reports on a whim.
I love this product. I get to see a bunch of movies, and tv shows.
I gave a 5 star review because its a great tablet for a child with disabilities
I always feel like, somebody's watching me!!!!! And now with my echo, I'm positive big brother is.
I purchased this so my wife and I could each have a kindle. It works fine but did notice some flaws in the kindle as far as the screen, some spots inside the screen where they do not light up correctly. Haven't taken it back yet to see if it can be fixed.
Great Roku TV; wish I had a separate remote for local channels
Enjoying my Alexas! We have multiple Alexa's and dots around the house and garage!!
Only thing it doesn't have is a place to put Sim card for WiFi.went to us cellular for WiFi but they cont because this item has no were to put a Sim card
Best purchase ever. Would recommend to anyone. It's the best
i play games, read books, watch movies, surf the web. love the expansion capability
I personally like the old shape ( more square ) of the kindle better. I use to have a 8 inch and loved it until my grandkids dropped it and now it doesn't work any more.
The Fire 7 interface is much better the Kindle Fire 7 which has had problems with email. The interface is similar to a smart phone which offers a learning opportunity for novice smart phone users. I both this Fire 7 for Rose because of similar interface and her older Kindle was presenting problems.The downside is the ads that pop-up when it awakes from sleep mode, but you can't beat the price. This unit makes a great gift and two of our friends have purchased the Fire 7.
Love the cost of the kindle! Great price for a tablet for children! Very user friendly!
I got this tablet as a Christmas gift for my wife. She has really enjoyed using it. I get tickle at her playing games on it. You got to remember she is 65 years young! :-)
I love my kindle fire. Its a great reading device.
Easy to take on trips, hospital or beach. Clear and sharp display. I like that I can add extra space with a stick. The price was right too. I would recommend highly.
Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product
It was a gift and she really loved it. It was an in-store service clerk that educated me on this product..
It's a basic tab. Only for reading. I didn't keep it.
Considering this was under fifty dollars I am satisfied with it.
It performs with no major problems and without excessive load times
This tablet has all apps needed for anyone. only one things not working with this tablet - this is some apps GPS.
I like this much better than the roku that we had and more options
Good upgrade from the basic kindle that I had before.
Fire TV,is just what it says.I found that this streaming player eliminated any buffering issues I had.I also enjoyed the voice activation feature,and it's accuracy in recognition.Save yourself some time, and just buy it now.
I needed to replace my Kindle fire that was damaged. It works great .
Very easy to use. There are lot's of different options.
I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who was looking for a simple e-reader. He loved it! It is simple without the fancy features of a tablet, but it works for what he wanted - to simply read books. The no-glare screen and optional back light are both great features!
Easy to use and has many options. Like how it can be utilized on two different units.
I love the Echo but I hate the fact that it doesn't have a rechargeable battery. I would really be convenient if I could take it on the beach or out to a park without having to worry about having a power source with me. Other than that it's great.
This E-reader makes reading ebooks very easy on the eyes and provides for a beautiful experience. The product feels like quality but gathers finger print marks on the back quickly if it doesn't have a case. Overall the e-reading experience is excellent though as the lighting and colors come across very pleasantly.
Alexa is awesome! With practice, she will keep you on the couch asking her to do all the work. She is easy to setup , understands sentences and really love how she can find any song you want using Amazon Music.
My family loves the Kindle Paperwhite. Prefer to read on this more than the fruity tablet. Great for outside, so my dog loves it too!! Lightweight, easy to use, lots of books to choose from. No complaints.
Cannot beat the price. Beautiful screen, durable materials. Extra bonus for prime users is Amazon Prime music and video library. Fits a great niche for ultra-portable needs. For music, I pare it with my Oonz portable speaker for great sound.
Alexa is great , is a great house hold tool around the house , timers alarm , sleep machine everything u need
Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device.
It works wonderfully. Works faster than the first generation.
And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started.
Great product. Live the amazon customer service as well. User friendly. Parental controls best I've seen.
Wanted to cut the cable cord and heard from friends about fire tv. Gave it a go and so glad I did. We love the programming and we pay for the shows we want instead of overpaying for cable. Would highly recommend fire tv
I bought this for a raffle at the school I work at. It has many educational apps and the student who won it was thrilled!
I bought 5 of these and they are really easy to set up and my kids love them; might order one for myself. Bought them on Black Friday for $33/each...should have bought mine then.
This Samsung excedes our expectations. The picture is clear and colors vibrant! Love it!
I bought two and gave them as gifts to a couple new to tablets. They love the FIRE tablet. now I think I am going to get one to play my games on. I currently have the iPad air.
My kids have these and love them. I may have to get one for myself
This is a great tablet. I bought several for gifts. Best Buy had the best price. I only gave four stars because of all the ads preloaded to these tablets is a pain.
The kindle paper white is amazing. I love that there is. No glare for outdoor use and the backlit is perfect for reading in bed.
Perfect for the kiddos, both for entertainment and educational enjoyment!! Definitely best tablet for the price!
I needed something new for my bathroom, love to sing in the morning. Love to listen to the radio getting dressed, hear the morning news and traffic. Great for winding down in the evenin with some jazz in a bubble bath.
Bought these while they were on sale for the kids. They loved it.
Setup was much simpler than originally planned and easy to install on non-smart tv
OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!
The flush bezel and display are a huge improvement. The text is crisp and easy on the eyes. The page press function and inclusion/position of the touch sensors is perfect. The price seems a bit high for something as simple as an E-Reader, but if you love to read this is a must have. You will not be disappointed.
Enjoy the multifaceted opportunities that are available with the Kindle
I love my Fire TV and has allowed me to cut all chords with any TV service providers.
I got this tablet for a senior that is learning to to use a tablet and learning navigate through apps and the Internet and adjust to a reader
The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good.
Setup my New Echo and had it become a new active family member in a few moments ! Very coo and very conversational ! New , Weather traffic reports .. does it all !!!
Goodbye outrageous satellite bills...hello Amazon!
I bought this for my 13 yr old child for Christmas. She uses it to download and read books (saves lots of space on the book shelf) and she browses the internet, and watches Amazon prime movies. So far it has been a great device and for the price, it has been an amazing deal!
Bought as a gift for my kids. Great device. Kids love it.
I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone.
My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him.
I have always wanted to get the best products for the money for my audio video experience. The Amazon Fire for 4K has not disappointed. It was exceptionally easy to set up and attach to the internet and my TV. The updates for the Fire are seemless and fast. The visual quality is what was expected. If you already own the Fire would I recommend the upgrade? Do not know, but wish there was some sort of buyback program and then the choice would be easier. I do like the gaming ability of the system but have yet to explore those options extensively.
I had a kindle which I unfortunately threw away by mistake with some papers. I bought a paper white and I am back to being able to read all the books I want, It can be put in my purse and I can read where ever I go.
Quality was good and the bluetooth worked ok but diconnected at times maybe because it was not charged?
My granddaughter loves this tablet. Love the fact that it has a two year warranty against breakage and also comes with a free year of Amazon Free Time.
Echo is great for all ages. It is an amazing device.
Love the Echo. So convenient and fun. Get answers to lots of questions, listen to music, books, sleeping sounds, etc. Purchased one for BR and LR since they are so far apart and love the quality of the speakers. Even purchased a dot for kitchen for cooking tips, recipes, and timers plus more.
Got this Kindle Fire to replace a laptop that died. So far I have been very pleased. Finding new things that it can do. Not happy with the camera, but I might not know all the details about it yet.
I have been a Kindle reader for years now but this is the first device I have used with a backlight and I have to say the eye strain is lower and the reading experience better than ever. For a pure reading device I do not know how it could be better other than lowering the price tag.
Based on what everyone says about this item , I went out and bought it. And I must say , it's awesome. I use it constantly and it now controls the lights in my living room, as well as an item in my kitchen.
I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.
The main criticism/feedback I have about all electronics has to do with batteries. I feel all batteries could be replaceable (& rechargeable, of course). This is not always the case. So, unless electronic recycling is available, feasible & non-damaging to the planet; that's a bit of a blow. I still feel, technology is great &this is no exception. Downloading non-Kindle items is a little more involved; but still possible. I've used &like the feature of downloading my own documents. I've done more reading than I have in many months due to the Kindle. It's easy to read anywhere. Font size &back lighting are adjustable which creates an ideal reading situation, regardless of circumstances. Wasn't sure about the size (6"); after reading 4-5 books; the size is perfect in my hand.
Still getting more and more abilities loaded onto system.
Very nice product. Must buy. It is a great for kids as well.
The Alexa has been a nice addition to our home. Overall we have instant music, weather, a joke, and best of all the ability to set a timer. Works as expected, nothing more or less.
Excellent Tablet for beginners and kids. The cameras and expandable memory are a big plus and this tablet is a steal at the price. Its not for everyone, you get what you pay for
I bought this because it has more storage space, it is easy to set up. I like the SD card option to expand the storage and it has a USB port so if I wanted to I could add an external hard drive.
Perfect for my now 5 year old alittle off setting up since use to an iPad but she's doing great with it
Alexa is always there to answer questions aboutjust about anything and seems to keep learning.will get fire tv soon as a roku died on me and alexacan work it for me
I honestly didn't care for it. The newest versions of this tablet are by far much better. You have a bit more freedom with it than you do the older version.
Absolutely love "Alexa"...On top of up to minute weather, traffic, news, etc.Can play all our music choices....have made her the centerpiece of our home automation system....she controls our lights, thermostat, can even lock our front door...a truly great product!!!
Grandkids are doing great. Love this product, and thrilled with grandkids usage.
Love this,got it jail broken so I can watch anything I want
i was hesitant about the echo i used att a friends house loved it
My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic.
I'm very happy with the improvement made to the fire tv. I'll definitely recommend this box to all my friends.
My daughter loves this Echo. Lots of fun to play with and very helpful.
Wonderful
I have been wanting one for a while now and happy I got one
This is a wonderful reader that is very easy to operate. I especially like the non glare screen and that ability to adjust the font size and the lighting. It is perfect for reading in the sun and in bed as well!!
Works great as a e reader as well as a tablet. My son loves it.
My grand children love kids tablets and play with them every day and their mother is using them to teach the kids
My son is fascinated with this tablet, and iam too.
Love my tablet. Simple easy to use for reading and surfing the Internet
Good tablet but very limited in apps, only to basic surfing
Got my daughter & son in law this for Christmas and my husband really enjoyed it, so I knew this would make a great gift for his birthday. I was very lucky and got the last one at our Best Buy store. Just set it up and having fun with it !!
I recommend it mostly for reading, but it's ok as a tablet.
I was uncertain about the fire tablet since I own an iPad mini. Bought it for my mother and love it! It works smoothly, the system is awesome and my mother loves it as well! I also got the HD 8 for my daughter
This product is easy to set up, the interface is simple to learn and navigate. The remote has voiced activated commands for control of the TV box. The cost of this unit is much less than similar units!
I love how fast it goes from one program to another program I like the apps that it has on it and also I like that is able to work with all my televisions that will problem.
Had the Fire Stick before this and liked it, but felt load times were a little slow due to less ram and a worse processor. This FireTV is excellent! Load times are extraordinarily and it is lightning fast. Would recommend this to everyone.
It is the second I bought it, the first was given to my mom, it is very easy to carry while you travel.
It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????
Bought this for my daughter for her birthday and linked it to my Amazon Prime Account so she can get free books, music, and movies. She loves it.
This is a nice item..I can set reminders get news and weather..all by the tap of a button
I bought 2 tablets. One for my oldest daughter an then one for my husband. Haven't had any issues with either. About to buy another one for my youngest now
Easy to set up. Easy to use perfect for playing music on demand
This thing is awesome. Connected my Spotify and can tell Alexa to play anything I want. I mainly use it for music. I use the timer feature all the time when I'm cooking, and listen some news and weather most mornings. It's worth every penny. Great product.
The product is as advertised. I have good internet and it works great. Was able to "cut the cord" and save a good bit of money.
Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app.
So far so good. My son loves it for his room and gives him ability to watch netflix
This tablet is for our 9 year old grandson. It works out great for him to play games on.
Very good Music quality to rival some more expensive speakers. This is in a course in addition to all of its inquiry function and now a wider range of controlling household devices such as thermostats lights. Overall a very good investment.
Fun discovering uses for the Echo. I can already see that the more I use it, the more useful it will become.
This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so
Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading.
My daughter loves this tablet. She cant keep her hands off it...
It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk.
I enjoyed it, looking forward to adding more things that are compatible with it
Bought these for my boys and they love them! Tons of features and battery to keep the boys playing!
Echo is great works well no problems, best with amazon prime
It works great for what I need. Not a fan of ads and that it sends e-mails of all the apps I download. But I just use it for a few apps.
We are so enjoying our Alexa Amazon Echo. We especially enjoy the music and stations.
Every time I use the echo I find there is something else that it can do. There is not a day that I don't find use for it!
The Fire Tablet has an amazing screen great price SIM card slot
Love the Amazon Fire. 4K quality, the remote ,and the ability to use it while traveling put this over the top. Plus it's less expensive than the Roku and Apple TV.
I purchased this product for my neice as a gift, the camera isn't very good, but other than that it has all the features she needs to play games, watch movies, stream music, and she even uploaded some of her music from her music libarary for listening. Has NetFlix and Prime Movies if you have a subscription.
Great product very easy to use. Installed kodi on it and love it.
Great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use.
I love my new Kindle Paperwhite. I can read with it inside or outside!!
Easy to use when traveling. Has all I need and is fast and covers my needs.
I love this device. I love learning all the stuff it can do and I look forward learning what Amazon is going to do to improve it in the future.
Purchased as a gift and person that received was happy and excited!
I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.
works great for my kindle paper white but the seond kindle that I ordered will cot turn on
Great value for the price grabbed 2 of these for the kiddos. They are capable of playing games and with the know how you can put Google play store on them.
Wonderful speaker that is easy to use. I have parred it with both my IPad and IPhone and it works great with both!!
This was a very good purchase. It is really easy to use.
This was a birthday gift for my son-in-law and he loved it. Coupled with the portable battery, it provides him with both entertainment and information whereever he goes!
I read the reviews, watched the YouTube videos, did tons of research and talked myself into getting an Echo. I am so glad I did. It has been the most useful thing I've purchased in years, turning out to be one of the most fun ones, too. I get my news, weather, music and audio books with nothing more than a request to Alexa. I also control my Nest thermostat and Philips Hue lights with a request as well. I have my alarms set up through my Echo as well as my shopping list, to do list and about a hundred other things it seems. I love my Echo, I think you'll love it, too.
BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP
I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TABLET AND IT KEEPS A GREAT CHARGE. GOT IT FOR A GREAT PRICE!
We got both our boys ages 7 and 9 one for Christmas they both picked up how to use it quickly. They both love them and couldn't be happier. Great alternative to a laptop for children.
already toldpeople about fast pickup.the kindle is great as always.
This wall charger works exactly as described for the Kindle Paperwhite.
Pros: Controls the lights in our house and integrated seamlessly with the wemo app. Plays music well and sounds great as a Bluetooth speaker. We are even able to add groceries via a 3rd party app (OurGroceries).Cons: Some of the commands are a bit of a mouthful and if you don't say the command in the proper order and in a timely manner Alexa will not understand. It would be nice if you could change the default built in lists and to dos to a 3rd party app to make the commands a little easier.Overall: A little expensive for a gadget but the home automation is really fun!
Bought it for my daughter 5 years old. Works great for her. She can do some reading and common core problems.
Hard to figure out to use this tablet can't figure out how to close apps. Also says no storage to run wifi. Lastly bought three of them and one is not working wish it came with a user guide
Great device for the price. Small enough to hide it and quiet enough to forget about it. 4K is the great addition that's on it. Compared to Apple TV you get more storage space for less on this and you get 4K too.
Screen is good, internet moves fast, easy to use and set up
I enjoy amazon TV and is easy to use that my young children can navigate it without my help.
Very fast box that I ever own very reliable product
I bought this for my kids aged 7 and 3. It's strong, bright, light weight, affordable and easy to use. I have never used any of the Amazon Fire products so there was a learning curve but and hour later I feel like a Fire pro.
It's a surprise to getting this kindle in this price. And it's a great device to read books.
Very pleased with my tablet. Love that it's HD and user friendly.
This tablet is really good for the price, especially on the holidays. If you are a movie watcher or just using it for games it has great speed with a quad core. Highly recommend so e-book as well. Very happy with my purchase I bought 3 already.
I had a firestick and moved it to my wifes TV. Decided to get this for the replacement. It is much more fluid, and integrates with my Alexa via the voice remote. You will like it.
I purchased this gift for my mom who loves to read and did not own a tablet. It was an inexpensive gift she will enjoy.
Bought this for my son and he is enjoying it everyday. user friendly
had a regular kindle and this one is just as light but with a backlight so it helps with night time or train reading (when in tunnels).A lot faster too, as it's newer.
I love all of my Amazon products including my latest purchase the Amazon fire box. I have the stick o, two tv's and now the box on my new 4k tv. Along with my prime account I am in heaven...
takes 30 minutes to connect to wifi and none of the apps work on it and i restored it 3 times already. Big and bulky. you will be better to get the more expensive model
I am very happy with my echo I will recommend it to all my friends and recommend they become a Best Buy member
Excellent Quality and Size for my 5 yera old daughterWorks Great 100% Satisfied
Got this as a gift for my mother. It is a great little starter tablet for anyone wanting to surf the web or play some games. I also like it because it is small and portable.
This product does everything it said it would and more.
Bought as a gift. I have one and wouldn't be without it.
esay to read screen and fast operating systemgreat for a young adult
Like it use it everyday. I have 3 grandchildren that live with me and they like playing on it too.
Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps.
The best ebook reader in the market. The text is crisp and I love the backlighting.
staff was great my son was very pleased with his purchase we shop at your store quite often love best buy
exactly what we were looking for, backlit display is awesome for reading in bed.
We actually bought these for summer camp and the kids love them and they work like a charm. The staff was a lot of help.
this a great tablet, my grandaughter uses the kindle settings for her little girl who is in pre school
It locked up on installing kodi and it wouldn't recover. The device buffers during first setup of any movie. Voice remote is not the best.
I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
Does everything I need and has a long battery life.
The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.
This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet.
Amazon Fire stick is perfect for anything. We play the games, stream movies and I like listening to Pandora Music. Its all in one.
We check local weather aND enjoy music. We get answears to questions.
Alexa has very good voice recognition. It has new tools added every day
You can barely find these in the store now i know why fast smooth tv and movie streaming great for games too
I want to rate it 3.5 but best buy lets me rate it 3 or 4, nothing in between. Similarly I see no point in upgrading from an old paperwhite until you really want a 300 ppi display. Kindle Paperwhite is good but not much has changed over the years, if you plan to upgrade over the old one think if it is worth spending.A paperwhite with 3G goes up towards 180-200 USD, I would rather invest the money on a tab. If you are sticking with the base version as I brought (99 USD - no ads), then its a good deal.
I bought this primarily for reading at night without a nightlight as to not disturb my wife. It has been perfect for that and normal reading conditions. I was nervous to move away from actual books, but it has not been as bad as I initially thought.
i was a little concerned how small it was, but the size is perfect. the back lighting is great for when it is darker plus it works well in sun light as well. the touch page turn is easy.
The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!
I purchased the tablet for my mother in law to use to read ebooks and play online games. It was very user friendly and a great price and product for our needs.
I was hisitating to buy to initially but after started using stated liking it .i would recommend for the same . Great experience
So easy to use. Compact & easy to carry in my bag. Love it!
Easy to use. Bought this for our grandson, he loves it!
This is my daughters second purchased kindle..great product for reading games and searching the web..durable and affordable.
Now that playstation vue went nationwide I wanted something something for live tv to replace my ps3. I am now able to watch cable tv and ota(through an hdhomerrun) with no rental fees. The picture quality is great and has a great app selection.
Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
Enjoyed it so much on one tv we decided to put itOn an additional tv in bedroom. Will be phasing out of DIRECTV soon.
For the price this tablet is an absolute steal! I've never had an iPad to compare it to but that's only because I've never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet.
Great little streamer and so much available content
Bought 2 for our grand kids Great price and very good graphics
I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it
Really enjoy the great speaker and music on demand by just asking Alex. Great buy!
Tablets are excellent for Youth Sunday School class.
Good deal. Nothing special, but a lot for the money! Would buy again, we have multiple.
We ask Alexa questions daily. I like coming into the house and having her play music with out me finding the remote.
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it! She uses it much more than her iPad for reading it's easier on the eyes.
We got this for my wife to take with her when travelling. Although she still prefers printed books, she really likes this reader and it lightens her suitcase considerably. Excellent battery life and a good screen.
I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. I know he will enjoy it. After I read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.
Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
There are many apps and books available for free with this tablet, so it is very entertaining. It makes shopping online easy too with the Amazon store app.
Great little assistant for around the house! Love all its little features!
Overall wonderful device! From playing music to asking for the time. My favorite feature is being able to turn on my wi-fi devices!!!!
Oh how I love this product. I spend hours playing solitaire, reading novels, listening to music all provided by my new Kindle Fire! I traded in my old Kindle which I also loved but this new one is a little larger and has more features many of which I haven't used yet. I couldn't be more pleased!
Got this as an early Christmas present. The sound it pretty good for a small speaker. We now have Echo controlling the lights, furnace and the A/V system. Set up is easy.
Functional for what I need. Compact so travels well.
Great item to have but a little more than the fire stick
I use this in bedroom. I have the fire stick also. The fire stick didn't work as well in bedroom but this fire tv is great. I like the voice controlled feature as well. Easy to use and set up.
I bought one of these for my father. He loves it and I noticed it is very well built like if it was built the same way as the Amazon Fire box which I am very impressed by how well built it is. Even the battery terminals are polished chrome tabs. I mean come on what company goes to that much trouble. The charger reminded be of an I-phone charger. Impressed by this little tablet I will have to pick one up for myself now in the near future. Good product for the buck!
Bought the echo first, and liked it so much I bought a Tap to add mobility. I carry it around all the time, to the garage, working out, etc.
Excellent value, great product. It has a really solid feel. I am very happy with the purchase.
Tablet is easy to use, however only allows 48 hours of offline viewing when movies are downloaded, then must be reset online again. This is an inconvenience. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the tablet.
There are a few things I like about the device. I like the remote. I like that I have access to Amazon Prime (video and music). I like that Direct TV Now is available. However, there are a few things that need to improve on the Fire TV. One, I've had more buffering issues on this device than I have had on my Apple TV or Roku box. Two, Alexa is a joke. Very little that she actually does. Three, the App Store is not as vast as other services.
I like the tablet its exactly what i needed and also easy to use.
My son loves it, reads every day now. I love the fact, there is no internet/games to destruct him from reading. Small size allows to take it everywhere, wonderful screen for eyes. Just perfect!
We got it for travel purposes. We didn't expect much.
I was looking for a Bluetooth speaker to use to play Amazon Music, and this product allows to to listen to music and do so much more. If you have an Amazon Prime account you'll enjoy this product.
Bought a new Fire tablet for my wife for a Mother's Day gift to replace an old tablet. She is fully enjoying the new device and fashionable case. Best Buy staff were very helpful too.
Received this for a christmas gift. Actually never heard of it before then. Have been using it for traffic information in the mornings before heading to work, quick homework questions with the kids, and music. Really a nice adult toy.
Overall for the price you can't really complain, yes it has directed advertisements on the start screen when you turn it on but again, $50 for a tablet isn't that bad and the ads can be removed by subscribing to Amazon Prime which offers features in itself too.
Awesome. Better than expected. Cannot live without Alexa
The amazon echo does what it's supposed to do. I wish it could call 911.
Great little cheap android tablet. doesn't have the best of screens or speed, but for the price it cant be beat
Bought this tablet for my grandson and he loves it.
I shopped for a long time until I found this and I am very pleased.
good sound quality and understand what you are asking without repeating yourself
This is good for beginners but not very good . Its wifi work terrible
My daughter loves the Amazon Fire tablet that I purchased for her!
Bought this for my mom during Black Friday. The screen is big enough for her to watch her movies and play her games. She thinks it's so easy to use. She was using a little cracked screen phone before so she treasures this.
Purchased the Amazon Fire HD 10 16GB for my mother and mother in law for Christmas. They LOVE their Kindle and the large screen is very easy on their aging eyes.
nice little tablet cant go wrong with the price can watch movies browse the net all kids of apps and can expand the memory
It's been solid so far. Can get a little glitchy every now and then, the text isn't as high a quality as it could look, and it may bother some people that not all apps from Apple and Google are available on the Amazon App Store. But for the price I think it's a good deal for those who want it more for small stuff like internet browsing, email, music, videos, etc.
I bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my parents. They are not tech savvy, but have been able to thrive on these. They love them.
Bought this for my 2 year old since he broke his portable DVD player. The only think I don't like is i had to sneakily download the google App Store so I could install vudu on it.
This tablet is very affordable and has more then enough things to do on it. Has features more expensive tablets have at a fraction of the cost. If something were to happen to it,it wouldn't be a crazy tragedy due to the price it is listed at.
Like the product a lot. Mostly use it for playing music, not very useful though if you have a bad ISP.
i bought it for my 2 year old, he loves it and will not put it down until he fall asleep
I use the echo every day. I play Jeopardy with my kids. It is very easy to set up and use. My favorite skill is the list maker. I just tell it what I need and it populates the list on my phone. I have lamps connected to the echo, and I can just tell Alexa to turn it on and off. I have used it more than once to find my phone! And the selection of music is incredible, and great sound.
Purchased for my wife to replace her previous kindle. She loves it. Great product.
My wife and I both got these. We've both really liked them. We had galaxy tab 3s before this and they seemed to slow down a little bit after a year. We're getting close to a year of having the fires, and seem to be still working well. The 8gb model has had some issues with big games, but casual games have worked well. We both like being able to take advantage of Amazon underground for apps. We've liked them so much we bought some for our nieces and nephews too.
I love this amazon fire tv! I use it all the time. The picture is crisp and the device is super fast!
I purchased the Kindle Fire 8" after owning a 7" for several years. I love the bigger screen and added features in this version.
Bought 3 of these for gifts. I am in love with Alexa. She learns new things daily and is easy to understand.
It does just what I need it to do! Easy to take on the go!
I Finally decided to buy the Echo. Went to BB 10 days before Christmas and bought the last one on the shelf. Set up was a breeze and Alexa works great and not to mention I bought it on sale.
Tablet needs an extra storage card quickly if kids are downloading games, but otherwise it is a very good buy for kids that have never had a tablet before.
Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
I slept on this item. Now that I have a Nest thermostat it is my new best friend.
Alexa is amazing. Keeps me and my kids entertained for hours everyday.
A great entry level tablet, all other tablets at that price don't stack up.
This purchase opened up so many options for viewing that we didn't have before. Easy to install and operate.
Good item..quality color and visual..Would buy another
The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
Good for beach and night reading. Easy to use and change fonts and light.
Easy to install. Great for playing music. Check the weather, news with just a question?
My son loves his Kindle for games and he loves it for reading.
Bought it for my 8 year old and it was perfect. She loves it and works it with ease.
love it... easy to use and efficient...appropriate for any age
Great value. Perfect Christmas gift. Easy to set up and easy to use.
We use it to control our Hue lights and Nest thermostat, along with music and making shopping lists. The kids use it for all kinds of goofy stuff.
This tablet is a great buy at it's price point and is the perfect entry level tablet. The Kindle app is flawless and reading on the Fire is a pleasure!
I love my Amazon Echo. We use it on the outdoor kitchen/patio. It has a very good speaker and access to my Pandora Music. It does so much more including instant weather reports. Several friends have purchased one as well.
Easy to useBattery life is goodEasy to read a book
My kids break stuff, not on purpose, but they break electronics. Rather than spend hundreds on other tablets(that might get broken), this kindle at this price was a no brainer. No bugs, simple menus, easy to use for kids 6+.
Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
As a travelling salesman, I spend a lot of time on planes, trains, and buses -meaning I have a lot of free time to read. It's really good quality as it has lasted me almost a year which is a new record for electronic devices for me. I would definitely recommend this because it's simple to use, it is lightweight, and durable.
Love my Alexa! I love all kinds of music and I can get it with Alexa! If your stumped on a question, just ask her. She know the temp. where you are and weather. It's amazing the sound that comes out of this little tube! The music sound is awesome!
Alexa is smart, funny and easy to use. I'm usually technologically challenged but Alexa is very patient with me!
I can see many more uses for this. I like the way it can be improved easily with more functionality added.
i really love this product i have down loaded many many books and i like it because it is big when i brought mine my sister returned and purchased her one too
I love that the tap is rechargeable and portable. Sounds is great! I highly recommend the tap!
Great tablet for my 6, 7 and 9 year old's. It's very easy for them to use with the 'Free Time' mode. I love Amazon and love that I can switch between different user profile no matter which tablet I'm using. Definitely recommend to others with children. Only downfall is some of the apps I use that are on either googleplay and itunes are not available in the Amazon appstore and it does not have bluetooth. But overall it is excellent for my children and the price was amazing!!!!
Excellent product. I did extensive research before purchasing my new kindle. This is the third kindle I've had. Only problem with kindle is that their charging port becomes loose and will not charge your kindle.
Purchase went smoothly and the ability to use American Express award points at checkout was a plus.
Even though the ppi is lower than the other tablets I didn't really notice it. I like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movies and TV.
Purchased as a Christmas Gift for my sister during Black Friday. Great tablet for reading books , surfing web, etc etc for your daily needs.
I got this strictly for the eReader capability and since I have Amazon Prime it's great for getting lots of ebooks at great prices. It's lightweight and easy to use.
This is a great product at a great price! They will make great first time tablets for kids.
Bought for uhd but not really worth the extra money
I bought this so I can stream the playstation vue app and it works great. Very speedy and seems to be faster than the Roku 4. I would highly recommend this if you are trying to cut cords and want a set top box for streaming.
Exactly what hubby wanted for reading. Likes it better than iPad for reading
Bought this for my 2 year old son. He loves it. The case makes it so much easier for little hands to hold. He's dropped it a few times and it's pretty solid, no scratches!
I love my new Fire. The only problem I have is putting it down when it's time to go to bed.
Kindle is more fun than a spindle. Your reading time will never dwindle.
works as it should.
50 bucks and It's still a good tablet . I have issues with it cause I've always used the iPad so it's a completely different experience .I just wanted something to watch movies while I rode the train and this is perfect . The biggest flaw is the ads everytime you turn it on but makes up with the capability of adding storage . Look 50 bucks for a good tablet is cheaper than a night out with friends
table is great, works good have had no problems with it and would recommend to a friend
Excellent tablet, Easy to use and very fast. It's just beautiful.
Have several Dots. Those that I want to play music over I have hooked into an external speaker. Rather that spend close to $200 on a sonos speaker plus the cost of the dot, I choose the echo as the best solution for the bathroom. Got the white color. Fits great on chair rail. White cord is easy to hide. One unforeseen issue is that it does go load enough that I have to wait for a break in the music before I can ask alexa to skip or turn down volume.
I had an original Kindle (wifi only) and loved it, however was limited when reading at night (I didn't want to have to attach a light or use a flashlight). The Kindle Paperwhite solves my dilemma! I would specifically recommend it for those who are frequent fliers.
This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
I have enjoyed this Kindle Fire. Each day, I find something new to explore and I'm thrilled I purchased it.
Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.
Bought this to do reading and store PDFs. Great if you are a college student that has to read many articles. Good Luck!!!
It works great as advertised. I bought a Micro SD card upgrade and that works too.
I've had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I'm very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price.
I've owned a Kindle Fire HD7 before and this newer Kindle fire didn't disappoint. It does the job really well for most things and the price you pay, but don't expect it to be a top of the line tablet.
Love it.. Would highly recommend. I use it everyday.
Use is all the time. Backyard favorite. Great by the fire.
I am so happy with my new Kindle. The ability to use it in bed or lowlight is great without disturbing my wife. The download is fast and easy.
Love my fire tv..... Mad I waited so long to get it but the best thing that has happened to me so far this year!! lol
Great tablet at a very good price, it works for everyone in the house from downloading apps/games to reading.
This is a very good tablet for the price (about $50 regular price). Good image quality and battery life. Have been a Prime member for several years, so the included media access - videos, audio and books - is great. It is NOT an android tablet, so much of the Google ecosystem is not available. The Amazon AppStore has lots of options, but not nearly as many as the Google Play Store.Would recommend adding a microSD storage card. Also would get better file manager and video playback apps. There are several good, free options from Amazon's AppStore.
The Kindle fire is a great product. Will do so many things. Would recommend to anyone.
Had the fire TV stick and this is much faster with better picture quality.
Alexa is great, also got the Amazon music unlimited, very happy
Will definitely keep buying Kindle fire from Best buy
My nephew love the Tablet I gave him for Christmas
I am so very happy with my new kindle paperwhite. It is everything I hoped for!
Excellent, I love it!! High quality, very responsive.
Lighter than a helium balloon. So thin. Bright white screen. Crisp letters. Intuitive. Easy touchscreen page turning (or a gentle squeeze on either side of the book) and easy menu access. Ideal size. I don't know how they can improve this further. Just ordered their (Kindle's) Origami cover too.
My son uses this and he has no problem with navigation of the tablet. It does everything he needs.
Some questions asked are not answered. Some answers are amusing.
I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content.
After thoroughly researching I decided to give it a go and buy it. After some trouble with initial setup, it works great! I have 2 young boys and they have really had fun asking Alexa questions. I have linked to a smart outlet which is really nice for turning a lamp off and on. Overall I have really enjoyed, to the point I just got one of the Dots for another room in our house.
paid 39.00 on sale. bought two and 1 week later one will not connect to wifi will have to return.
Lost my older Kindle touch so needed to purchase a new one. Much the same as the old-which is good, not a hard learning curve. This one however now has the light, which is great. Very light in weight also. Definitely recommend.
I hadn't bought an "updated" Kindle in quite a few years, so as the battery on my old one wasn't holding a charge very long, and searching or downloading anything became a half-day event, I felt it was time. So, off I went and purchased the latest 7" screen Kindle Fire, and holey moley what difference. This new one is incredibly fast, has a beautiful picture, amazing capacity (plus a SD slot for expansion), and a two-way camera to boot! I'm still learning all the new bells and whistles, but so far this has been great and looks like the beginning of a beautiful relationship!
This is a great tablet if you don't plan or want to spend a lot of money for one.
Easy to set up, Amazon gives lots of help and new ideas for using it! Fun and very helpful!
The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with many free apps for kids. I set parental controls to prevent internet access. My only issue is that the Amazon App Store doesn't offer the YouTube Kids app. Other than that he's had the the tablet for about 4 mths & we've had no issues.
This is my 3rd Kindle. I absolutely love it. The best feature I have found on it is the "BlueShade" option, which changes the light levels for when reading at night. Also you cannot beat the price. May be purchasing another one for my son in the near future!
I bought this tablet for my 15 year old daughter. She loves it. She streams movies and is able to use her social media apps without a problem. For under $50.00 it was a steal.
This is my 4th Kindle and my 1st from Best Buy. It was much easier to purchase on line and pick up at the store a short time later.
I bought this for my grandma and she absolutely loves it! Very easy for her to figure things out and she is not tech savvy by any means! She loves reading books and getting on her Facebook so this was perfect for her!
Really love the Echo. Still learning all it has to offer.Happy with the purchase
Looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets
Good gift for someone. Got this for my girlfriends mom for xmas.
Love it! Great customer service at Best Buy. Recommended to friends.
Bought 2 of these so far and they work great for the price. Buy a mini SD card with it because it only has 8GB onboard. This tablet is a good buy for your kids and you can enable parental controls if you choose to do so. I would recommend this tablet as a good buy. It's not the fastest thing around but it gets the job done. At 50 dollars you can break it and not care lol.
I bought this for my 8yo daughter to replace a Trio tablet that didn't even last 2 months. It has been fine for my daughter for playing games, checking email etc. No complaints here.
I purchased 2 Kindles for each of my girls. I can't seem to put them down. They keep up with my Samsung 10.1 Tablet. Great Price for the Tablet.
It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bose sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it
I am still learning what all the Echo can do but it is awesome. I love the shopping list, the timer, just being silly with games. Working on getting plugs and light switches to control the house.
Replaced my Nexus Player with this. Much snappier and better network connections (mostly due to the wired ethernet). Have yet to try it on the 4K TV, but it's very easy to use and works well with Netflix and Plex.
Great device for someone who is not very technologically advanced. Easy to use and understand.
Works flawlessly and love it. Great options and apps.
Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
The tablet is almost perfect, needs to add more apps
We officially cut the cord and decided to use this as well as an antenna for local TV...The screen resolution is great. Navigation speed is quick without delay. We use Playstation Vue and it works seamlessly with the Fire TV...
I'm glad I made this purchase. I can now choose from hundreds of movies to watch. The Amazon fire tv allows for storing personal pictures and seeking assistance from Alexa. Great buy! I do not ever plan on paying for digital or cable TV again.
This is a good tablet for my daughter. Does everything she needs it to do.
I bought this for my son to occupy him on car trips. If you are an Amazon Prime member, then this really makes sense to own
Best Buy not only gave me great customer service, they were very patient with an "older" techie. At 67 I really appreciate being guided by a knowledgeable younger person. I would refer anyone looking for electronic devices to Best Buy.
Great price for product category. Does what it's supposed to.
Not Kid friendly at all. Purchased for little nephew. Wasn't given any info on it for sales person either. Took back!!!
I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it.
I'm a PC guy that wanted to try a tablet without investing a lot as a first step, so $50 was a great way to get in. Its fine for browsing, photos, checking email and weather. So far so good.
Love the fire stick. So much easier to use than Apple TV. Thinking of getting another for upstairs.
Very satisfied useful for internet and email. Will continue to use this brand.
A while ago, my Echo power supply stopped working. At the time, Amazon was out of the OEM power supply and provided me with a replacement from China. That one worked but was bulky and not as good looking as the OEM one, so I decided, when Amazon had caught up with back orders, to reorder a 'real' power supply. Very glad that I did.Sleek, stylish power supply for my Amazon Echo. Works as it should, and hopefully will last longer than my previous power supply!
Once hooked up, great product. Be sure to have a router large enough to deliver streaming tv.
I really like the fact that this tablet allows me to look at Facebook and Twitter and such. I'm thinking about passing it down to one of my siblings.
Would be better if you could use the Google play store, still haven t figured out how to download yet
great product, especially if you have Amazon Prime
Bought this for my 9 year old. It's perfect to keep on hand to keep her occupied if we get caught waiting somewhere.
This is a great tablet for the price. Currently using it for 3 year old. Love the parent timers and settings. Only negative is with no physical button, going back or 'home' is little harder than other tablets. It isn't the fastest tablet either but works well if you use it for very basic needs
Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket
I'm still learning. So far we are enjoying music, setting timers, and setting appointment reminders. Will soon be making my grocery list and watching movies. I really need to read up on all she can do.
Cool Product! Bought the Amazon and Google items at the same time... One for work, one for home... The google does seem to be a better product overall, and it calls you by name... Both good products though...
You will find detailed reviews of kindle paper white online. I will cover some other general observations,If you send a pdf to your kindle email , it will sync it to your kindle. But the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size. You have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font size.You will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with "Convert" in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email (refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email). However it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain (varies from pdf to pdf). Also if you are used to ios or android, the page turns are not the same like flipping. when you tap or perform a page flip,It will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page. I found this a little annoying but it works. if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctly.Battery usage is fantastic.Another positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience. They have settings to adjust brightness as well.
Great product but needs to learn more. It would be nice if it could connect to tv sound.
I love the voice controled volume. Having it synced up with my apps and the internet makes for great hsnds free information getting.
Still learning how to use. Would love to get local channels.
My little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. Best Christmas gift ever.
Alexa answers a lot of questions, plays any song you want, and has great sound!
I bought it for my son and he has now been using it extensively for the past 2 months. His primary use is to play games and he gets bored with every game soon. So he has to find and download a new one every few days. I occasionally use it to watch some online videos as well. We'd have loved if it were a bit faster but at the price it's not something we can complain about. Overall we are both satisfied with the purchase.
Purchased this tablet for my 9 year old stepdaughter as a step up from my old cell phone. She loves it and uses it as much as possible. Very easy for to navigate through, even with her still struggling somewhat with reading some words.
Nice tablet for the price. Screen is very clear. Tablet makes Amazon Prime more enjoyable.
We really like all that it does its amazing device
Initially I bought the Amazon echo to take it for a test drive. Just to see what all the hype was about. After about a week of playing with the device. I bought an Amazon echo for my bonus room, my living room, and my bedroom. I am simply amazed at what the Amazon echo can do. I am a lifetime Apple product supporter but this device here is simply the best I've seen so far. Pair the echo with a smartthings hub....then ask Alexa and its done.
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
Small enough for a purse and works great. I would recommend memory card.
It has been a great tablet for my daughter. User friendly.
I always read books on paper and thought it would not be the same to use a kindle, but now I'm totally happy with it. Thanks to it now I read more when commuting, traveling, ... as it is a very handy and light product.
Great tablet for kids to play games, school apps and reading
Ordering from Amazon is simpler than ever. Use this in any room for sound as well when you aren't making an order.
Great buy for the money, no complaints. Highly recommended.
Lots of programs that I didn't know was available. Quick easy setup and hours of free entertainment.
I purchased this as a gift for my father and he has absolutely enjoyed having it!!! It was indeed a good purchase!!!
Just perfect, for my child who is only 9 years old
I was amazed at how clear and crisp the letters appear. I can't put it down. It is light and easy to hold and page. I like the size because it is easy to carry but big enough to use.
Great tablet for the price, easy to use, small enough to fit in my pocket book when traveling, it basically replaced my samsung.
Bought this as a gift as I was on a budget, I figured it would be okay but I got say it is actually faster than my iPad Air with connectivity and more than abundant features and apps
Brought for my four year old he loves it has no problems using it at all
Bought as a gift and very easy to use. Everyone was happy!
Still so many things to learn but I really appreciate the quality of the speaker, has great sound.she is very responsive and polite.
If we were going off of percentages this would get a 90%. This improves greatly over the old Fire Stick. With a faster processor, 4K support, and the freedom to install 3rd party apps, this is literally the only device you need to access just about anything you could ever need. The only gripe I have is that it is missing Vudu, otherwise, it's one of the best streamers currently available.
The Amazon Echo is a very nice addition. It's kind of like Siri without the need to hold a phone. I have it paired with my WeMo switches and so far it works great!
I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.
I have the echo, the dot and now the tap. The sound is good. Better than the dot but not as good as the echo. The thing the tap has over the echo and dot is its portability. Which is nice not have to be next to a plug all the time. I would recommend it.
I use this device for watching movies and TV shows. I will suggest install MX PLAYER for MP4,MKV,ETC videos. It is a nice device for beginners.
The tablet has good versatility and is an excellent device for young children.
This kindle was a prize for a raffle for a union meeting. Excellent for beginners just starting off. Great price
This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside. The sound is excellent, Alexa's response is better than any digital assistant to date, and the ready access to Prime is convenient. This is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well. Additionally the inclusion of Bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing.
Love my (Alexa) amazon echo. Would highly recommend.
so far it's a nice toy in the kitchen, and it appears that there is a lot of up and coming apps that will be nice once they are all working. right now it can only do basic stuff. the speaker on it is just ok, they could improve that on the next upgrade. i don't even think it's stereo.
This is my 4th tablet (all different brands) and it's the best yet! Easy to set up, loads and run fast. No problem getting books and apps. All for only $50!!! Also bought one for my husband and he loves his, too.
I purchased this in order to stream Playstation Vue. It works very well for this. Amazon also offers 4K content - one of the few places you can get it for now.
Decent price for a nice tablet. Got it for Kids, I set it up and got ready to go, kids love it and spend time playing their fave apps.
Since the Fire TV stick was announced, I've heard a lot of people wonder if it was something worth picking up, essentially asking what does this thing do that my TV doesn't do already The answer is going to be different for different people, but here's an easy way to think about it Amazon Fire TV Stick is an excellent purchase if:-Your TV is not a smart TV. Meaning your TV or dvd player did not come pre-loaded with apps such as Netflix, Youtube, Pandora etc...-Your TV is a smart TV, but apps do not perform well. Some smart TVs have painful performance when streaming video, apps can be difficult to update, wifi connection can be spotty etc...-You want to access Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pandora, and other such apps on your TV-You are an Amazon Prime Member and want to access your Prime Video, Prime Music, and Prime Photo accounts-You want to participate in casual gaming on your television.-You want to listen to music on your TV-You want to have portability. In other words, Television access to the above services while you are travelling. (Amazon says the capability to use in hotels/dorms etc... with shared wifi that requires frequent password entry is coming soon)So, the bottom line is that the Fire TV Stick allows you to access your movies, music and photos as well as games and more via your television. If your TV already does these things well, or you're already doing them via other devices such as a game console, then this may not be worth your while.So, how easy is it to use I'm telling you, you do not have to have an ounce of technological know how to have this thing up and running in a matter of minutes.Read more
Has lots of ads and seems to be a little slow in response. Bought for my kids and they like it so I'm ok with it.
I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it���s not cable. I miss cable, but I don���t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.
Trying to find a tablet to teach my father in law on who not tech savvy and it's perfect
It is a very good product with great quality. Good
Nice Toy. In the future, when I get more accessories to work with it, will be more rewarding.
Tablet is easy to use and I can carry it with me in a medium size purse. Easy to down load books and other information. I had the Kindle before and this upgrade is a pleasure!
I like it because is very resistant . The only thing we didn't like is that sometimes it's kinda slow
Amazing fun getting into the technology age. Connected Echo w Philips Hue lights and Bluetooth speakers. All works great. Wifi consistency a must. Takes getting used to asking a non-human questions!
I was hesitant at first to purchase the echo bec of my experience with the Apple Siri. But I asked around from people who has it and I got good reviews. Alexa is always there to answer me, quick response and could understand even people with accent.Great product specially at the price I got..
Good for kids to have some nice fun and entertainment . Liked it
Tons of movies and all the sports you want. No more cable
Device serves my intended purpose very well. Clear screen and easy maneuvering.
I have really wnjoyed this tablet has not given me any reasons to dislike it.
Awesome product! Can do so much with my Kindle! Love it
Easy setup and seamless streaming. Would like to see Amazon upgrade this item to 4K.
Was tired of getting ripped off by Greenlight cable so decided to do something about it.No monthly charge or late fees for movies.
Great product. The future of reading is paperless!
I recommend the Fire to all its teriffic and easy to operate it has a great battery I use it daily you would love it !!!!!!!!!!!
I love Paper Books but my eyes do not like reading them. This E Reader is fantastic! I take it with me everywhere and Read in any light. Love Love Love this item!
Amazon did a fantastic job. I gave it to my father as a Christmas gift and he loves it.
I have a fire stick but wish I would've know about the fire tv. Hands down 100 time better. If you have the extra cash well worth it!
Use my echo daily. Easy to set up and use. Great for background music, weather and traffic in the morning.
This tablet is a really good value. Gave it as a gift and it was a hit!
This product has great sound quality and easy to use. I love it and have given it as a gift twice now.
It a great speaker and also a great personal assistant.
Tap makes a great mobile Alexa device. Not as loud as Echo but still louder than the Dot. Voice enabled Alexa works but doesn't detect voice as easy as the Echo or Dot. As a mobile Bluetooth speaker though it works fine.
Bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology. The Fire HD8 was easy to setup and has many great features. She is catching on well and learning new applications daily. A great value.
I bought my new Kindle Paperwhite because it has the lighted background. Works perfectly!
It's an awesome product. The sound is pretty impressive from such a small cylinder. News, sports, weather, jokes, and nearly whole house control. We love it!
Your personal electronic assistant answering your question and providing answers, WOW!!
Echo is good for listening to music and quick information. Great for hands free timers and alarms.
I like this thing I have it turning on lights in and out of the house it good for getting info about things it can do math it can hear very good and will play music from my Pandora account that's just a few things it can do.
Was looking for something decent and inexpensive for my niece. Got this for Black Friday and so far it's been great. Internal memory doesn't worry me because it will mostly be used for streaming apps like Youtube and Netflix. I wish the UI would be better but overall the tablet is good enough for what i bought it for.
Bought it for my 4 yr old nephew who loves it. Easy to use.
oh my gosh so love this kindle - I was not going to purchase it at this time but I could not pass up the price - and the advances it has made over the previous kindles. this one has a lot more bells and whistles and is much easier to use! and the lighting is much better with this one too!! so glad I bought this kindle
Charges all my items extra fast. Love it when I'm short on time
Good tablet for the price. Doesn't have great Wi-Fi capabilities but great tablet for on the go and for kids. The 128 MB expansion slot was the selling point. Very happy with it.
My kid loves her new "phone" as she calls it. Clear picture and it is fast as well. Great item for the money!
We bought this for daughter for christmas. Fantastic tablet.
I love this Kindle. It is a replacement for my old kindle keyboard. I used it constantly, for hours every day, carried it in my purse all the time, and traveled with it. I will not be without a Kindle. nice product.
Bought this item with high expectations of its capabilities. It would be extremely lenghty to supply full details, let me just say that technology is not there yet with AI devices like this....
I wanted a tablet had no idea what one I wanted and the sales clerk said that he would buy this one if it was him making the purchase so I said OK bought it and was in and out of the store in 15 minutes! Great service and a great product!
The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option.
She has dropped it a few times and the case is just great
Great product, I would recommend this device to everyone looking stream
Great product...no problems at all. If your looking for a great media streaming look no further than the Amazon Fire TV.
Fast for the buck. I would give it a perfect 5 stars but the screen seems to have dead pixel after couple of use, but still great cheap for kids.
I love being able to use voice activation for anything from playing music to making an Amazon purchase.
I cut my cable and move to Playstation Vue. Amazon fire tv boxes are fast and picture quality is amazing. I purchase 4 boxes for the whole house.
This KindleFire was exactly what I needed, for light weight, portable entertainment for my granddaughter on a trip. I could access all of the audio books, games and reading material from the audible app and kindle app on my iPad, onto this small device that slipped easily into my purse. it was easy to use on the airplane as well as in line at Disneyworld, without taking up much space or being heavy.
Its a awesome tablet and very durable for children
I bought this tablet for one reason and it has accomplished that perfectly. To stop my 8 year from nagging me everyday that he wants a tablet. I haven't had to hear those words once in two weeks after months of nagging me. Had I know I could get him a cheap one instead of an iPad I would have taken care of this a Long long time ago. 53 stars in my books.
My kids are very pleased with their tablets and i was please with how easy it was to set up and use right away
Replaced the Roku so I could have Alexa change my shows.
Not bad for an entry level consumer. Decent for kids (with a bumper) and adults that aren't super tech savvy.
It works great I would definitely recommend it to a friend I would buy a few more if I had to but the price should drop down a little bit
I bought this for my daughters for Christmas but it has some limitations and doesn't let you do some stuff the other kindles did.
I like the Echo a lot. Mostly because of voice automation with Alexa. I've had my Echo Dot (from Best Buy too) since last November (about eight or nine months) and I like it for my bedroom, but the added speaker on the larger Echo device is much better for listening to news or music. If you turn on the "start of request" sound though, it's not as loud as the one on the Echo Dot, which is both good and bad. Either way, I like this device, and I'm glad I got it for only $100 with the added protection plan.
Easy to set up. Fun to use. Working toward whole house automation.
My kids loved it, they were able to learn how to use it right away
Great for the price you can not beat this kindle fire l
Love this item, it is absolutely amazing for you home.
Great price, sounds great ,it can do alot of stuff
Love this size. It fits in my purse perfect. Love all the features it offers. The price was the best part.
I'm loving my fire TV. I had a fire stick which I've since moved to the bedroom. I like that I can hardwire the box versus using only wifi on the stick. The biggest thing is that PlayStation Vue, Playstation's new TV streaming service, is only available on a few platforms and Amazon fire TV/ stick is one. So now I have my Hulu, Netflix, and PS Vue all in one place. The fire TV is a cord cutters best friend.
As a standalone charger, this one does pretty good and I like the versatility to charge other items with the USB female plug vs. something hardwired that allows me to charge other USB-type devices in addition to something that uses a micro USB port.Charging time is faster for a Kindle Fire vs. my regular e-Ink Kindle charger, but since I haven't - and rarely - fully drain one of my Fires I cannot comment on the faster aspect for charging a Fire: I just know it works, and it does seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from Verizon. Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last. Ive never had one break as other brands do, I just keep leaving them in random hotels and airports while traveling and have to buy another! If you are looking for a solid and longer-lasting charger for your tablet, I would recommend this one.
This works great and allows us to watch tv movies and shows when it is convenient for us. Love it.
Love the 8 inch HD tablet. Great colors on screen. Not cheaply built like some.
I have purchased this item to give as gift. It works great for kids. I only wish it had few build in apps that a child could start using right away. Anyhow, its great for kids, whether in us or anywhere in the world. I have definitely recommend this to all my friends and family.
LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN
I bought Kindle for my wife because she is an avid reader. She is very happy with the paper white kindle as it is easy to read inside And outdoors.
This table working perfect. Ir has very good resolution
Great price and easy to set up. Already read 4 books on my new fire. Graphics quality is pretty good too.
Finally a perfect tablet for my son. With the addition of the memory card my son is able to play the apps he wants and still have his school apps on it! I am still able to use the parental settings to keep him safe. We all really enjoy this new Kindle and the price!!
Bought to get rid of uverse and installed Playstation Vue. Works great
I bought this for a friend, Kim does are easy to learn on.
No surprises with this purchase - Works well and am pleased with it...
Bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. I like the parental controls and the apps.
Love it use it for watching tv and listening to music.
I bought a bunch of these for Black Friday. Well worth the money. Each person I gave them to for Christmas was so happy.
I use an iPad daily, but saw the Fire 7 on sale and could not pass it up. It is a very solid tablet. I use it to watch Prime videos when I travel. Should have bought the larger screen. It was will worth the buy.
Perfect for those of us who don't want to buy books and really prefer not to carry a stack from the library. Once I got the hang of it, books were easy to load from our local library. The Kindle is easy to hold and I can adjust the page brightness and type size as needed. Would not get though if you want to see color pictures in books.
Screen is very clear and it is easy to use. Great product for the price.
My children loved their previous kindles so much I bought them an upgrade with the case - so worth it.
I would have never though this $35 tablet would have so much for me to do i love it
Easy to read in the sunlight. I really like that it adjusts to the lighting available making it easy to read anywhere.
for the money nice tablet perfect fo my seven year old granddaughter
AFTER 3 YEARS WITH A SMALLER AMAZON FIRE THIS ITEM IS A GREAT RELACEMENT. VERY SLEEK DESIGN. OVERALL EASE TO UPDATE FROM ORIGINAL SOFTWARE WAS NICE . VERY HAPPY WITH PRODUCT
No cheaper reader on the market. Great value. Good product.
Bought as a gift for my daughter. and s he loves it.
I bought this tablet for watching movies and reading books. It is also a great tablet because I can set my children on their own individual side, and set up parental controls
I've had a number of kindles since inception and this one is fantastic. The back lighting works great and the device is responsive, light, and agile. I wish there was a way to delete ads after you've bought the device
This is one of the best gadgets I have bought. It feels as if one is reading a real book. Battery life which last almost a month on moderate reading.
Grandson is enjoying this tablet very much lots of learning games to teach him plus having fun too.
i love to use it, i read several books in my beautiful kindle
It's a good E-reader, and the service at Best Buy store was perfect.
My daughter had been asking for a tablet she loved it and since likes to watch movies and play games and take a bunch of pictures i like that you can expand the memory up to 128 gigs.
Love all the apps available more than any other streaming Device by far with 4K content .
I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
"Alexa" Amazon Echo is the perfect personal assistant. From "to do" lists to music, alarms and so much more. I have it on my night stand and the plan was to eventually put it in the kitchen for the family to use, but no!........., she's mine! My wife is so jealous, lol. But seriously, great device, lots of fun and very useful.
Overall, this product works great on non-smart tvs; very easy to install.
This has a lot of great features for kids and for parents who want to protect them. My kids love having their own.
Love this Amazon box, very great for putting Netflix and Hulu
This was a gift for my boyfriend. He usually has apple products but I bought him this tablet and he loves it. It's easy to watch his videos, browse the web and even download books.
Still learning what to say to Alexa, but ever since we purchased the Amazon Echo, Amazon started sending me emails regularly to help us learn new phrases, which I appreciate.
I got this stuff for myself to watch Netflix, YouTube
Built in wifi support is much better than the fire stick.. Less buffering
I ended up buying this tablet for my grandpa for Christmas , I started setting it up for him and found out I loved it. So I bought myself one, my grandma one, and we adopted 6 kids for Christmas this year and bought them all one. It's easy to use and great for all ages. I also love that they use the Apple Store so I can get my favorite apps and games on it. This is by far the best tablet you will ever get for less than $50. And it now comes in fun colors!
It worked.
Works perfectly for my kindle
**Purchased the Amazon - Fire - 7' Tablet because it was available for $10 off the regular price.....I needed a tablet that was inexpensive and reliable and found the Amazon Tablet to be a great option....
I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton!
For the price this thing cannot be beat. It does more than expected, very pleased.
Great product for children to enjoy for a low price.
Got tablet for my daughter..love everything about it and how easy it is to use.
Would buy another...and would recommend to all.AAA
Love it this is so much better then paying for cable TV there's so much to see you can see and even have to pay extra for it to view movies
This case fit my Amozon Fire great. It was just what I wanted.
This is so far the best Kindle I have ever owned. I love the screen and the resolution on it. The device out performs all of the other e readers on the market.
I bought this for my son's 7th birthday and he loves it!
Easy to install and use. The only cable not cut is internet.
Easy to use for any age, would recommend to anyone
This is a great tablet. Great for the price. Very fast and easy to use.
The only thing I have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device. Why is that?
So much easier to read on this. The light helps too. Although having a nice hard cover in the hands is still nice
Bought the Echo Tap, Echo Dot, Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature, check weather, play music, etc., I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also, when the Dot and Tap are in the same room, the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests. Nice device that will only improve with time.
Great screen and very light to hold. It makes reading a book effortless.
I got this tablet on thanksgiving night sales for my 7 year grandson he loves it
Easier on the eyes than my Ipad. Purchasing at Best Buy was convenient with online order/pickup and they matched the Amazon price!
Not as good as the higher end Kindles, but nice product for the price point. If you're an avid reader, and especially if you are an Amazon Prime member then this product offers an incredibly great price for entry into the Kindle reading products, especially now that there is Amazon Prime reading. For even more value and selection, join Kindle Unlimited. In short: This little device and a Prime account offer an incredible selection for countless hours of reading. I can't see how you can go wrong, unless you plan to watch videos and then I recommend one of the nicer Kindles...maybe? This one can do the job, it's just an entry level, basic model; but for reading, I don't believe you'll ever wish for more.
This tablet is hands down the best investment I've ever made. I used to carry a laptop to meetings, then my kids talked me into getting a tablet and what a difference. As long as there is wifi it does everything my laptop will.
The new tablet is great  nice upgradesLove how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web.
Great entry level tablet/reader holds a lot and it's expandable of 128 GB
I am an old guy and I am having trouble trying to get the unit up and running. I decided I really should return it but it was past the return date. It is back in the box waiting to find time to try one more time or put it on ebay.
I have had one before and I like the new camera feature on this one. Easy to use and the clear picture.
I think Ok Google can do the same or more. I found annoying by saying Amazon or other echo names repeatedly to get some answers if you get them. May be in future I may try when it is more practical
love this. I didn't want anything super big or bulky. something simple for a few fun app games
I take my paper white reader every where with me. It fit nicely in my purse. I read all the time, even in the car where the sun is shinning in on it. I just love my paper white and wish I had bought one sooner.
Got it for my granddaughter, she loves it, great for games and internet
Great option to take your library on the go without multiple distractions that come with a tablet.
Streaming box that does the job, I can access My Prime videos and other streaming apps, good device for a good price, worth the money.
I purchased my mom one once I got mine. I also convinced my uncle to buy his wife one. That's how much I love the Echo
i recently cut the cable and was looking for something to have all my streaming apps in one place without having to mirror a phone or tablet, and without having to connect a pc to a tv. this works amazing, never had any problems with it whatsoever, very easy to use, pretty straight forward. highly recommended!
Very easy to use. Good to use at parties and entertainment.
This is really very comfortable and easy as well as strong for toddler my baby really enjoy using this amazon fire kids
Great for my 7 year old she loves it!!! Great price and great product!!!
This kindle is a great product. I really enjoy it.
Easy to use, easy setup, and nice interface. I would definitely recommend this product.
Have been using my kindle app on my iPad for years but now can't Imagine using anything besides my kindle to read. Love the backlight so I can read at night.
Cute little fire. It seems to be worth the value for all the things it can do. It could run a little faster. Nice for the buy.
Love listening to a variety of music. Alarm setting is great
You know, for about a year now I've been thinking of getting a portable speaker, so when the Tap was on sale I decided that this was the perfect answer since I was already committed to the Alexa paradigm.
Very happy with this product. I would recommend for anyone
Tablet does great for its price segment. Very resourcelful and fun for kids.
It is much faster than the firestick and much higher quality picture.
Bought this as a Xmas gift for my daughter to replace her older version kindle. She loves it.
If you're a fan of any form of electronic entertainment you're going to love this device
Has great abilty to perform at high levels e as sy to operate . Very simple technology
My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose.
Can't beat the price and features on this tablet. All the features are competitive even with Amazon's proprietary operating system and appstore. Most common Google play apps are available, but if they're not, chances are there is something analogous. Navigation can be a little cumbersome as it isn't as customizable as some might like, but bottom line is, it's a pretty full feature tablet for fifty bucks.
Love my Kindle, easy to use and works great! Would recommend.
After reading several reviews, I purchased this as my first Kindle because it wasn't the lowest-level Kindle but I didn't need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive one. I purchased this specifically because of it's size and ability to read outside with no glare issues. The ads are not annoying enough to make me wish I paid more for the ad-free versions. It is a perfect price-point for reading outside and on the go.
My husband set the Kindle for our grandson and he just loves it. Now he can read every day as well as play games, also he watches videos.
Amazon Echo is truly awesome. Better than Google Home in my experience. It's just an awesome device to have around the house. Highly recommend, 10/10!
Love it !!! Easy to use !!! Wonderful apps. Price was fantastic.
This product is good for kids. Has options to put different users to have set up how each person wants it and can set parent controls.
Works better than expedited, speaker is amazing for its size
This is great. Stream all the Prime Video plus your normal stuff on YouTube Netflix, etc.
I bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!!
The echo makes life easier and fun. Great speaker!
This is my 2nd fire and I was so sad when it crashed. Love my new one but giving 4 stars bc the need to update the charger at the bottom. It sticks and you can easily break the inside I wish they would change that
So far, works just as it should. Haven't used it over WiFi, as I have it direct connected to my modem. I love that it came with a remote, but wish it could use a universal one, but the phone app works just ads well, too. Wish there was an off button, not just sleep mode.
I have a lot of things in my home automated and we use Alexa as a part of that. I'd wanted a portable Alexa to use in our deck area and first look at a Tap late 2016. I ruled it out because the user had to touch it to enable Alexa which isn't convenient. I purchased a Dot battery pack and it worked okay but once I dropped and broke it, I needed a new solution. I knew that Amazon had added voice activation so I bought a Tap. It is great. Sound quality is good enough for me and it is a semi-rugged Alexa device we can port around outside.
Good tablet for the price. Nothing g fancy but my young children like them a lot.
I love the Amazon Fire TV. This is a great device!
Did every thing we expected. I think it is like having someone to help you. It has the weather for any city I need it for. Plays the music I want to hear
Everytime I give one of these as a gift, it is worth so much more than the $40 I paid for it. Durable and lasts a really long time. Great for kids.
The easiest and lightest way to read a book any time and any place.
great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books,
Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son.
This is my third Kindle, quite easy to use, kid friendly
Much faster than the stick in every way (wifi, processor, and ram). I like this a lot more than the stick it's just snappier.The voice remote is useless. I still prefer the Apple TV 4, over AFTV.
I was using my iPad mini to read for a long time, but felt like getting a dedicated device for reading since I am a Prime member. I ended up buying a kindle with no back light... Don't fool yourself, LED lights and book lights do no where near the same job as the Paper white. I can hold the device in one hand for long periods of time and the light doesn't wear my eyes down like my iPad. Really love the Paper white, I'm catching up on a lot more reading.
Bought it for my mom and she loves it. Easy to use.
Love my Kindle Paperwhite. Love that you can read it outdoors.
Best thing since sliced bread. I'd give 10 stars if I could.
I was really impressed by this tablet compared to the price. It's not the fastest but it gets the job done and a convenient size. I allow my daughter to use this when doing research for homework. It's basically enough so she doesn't get sidetracked and it's advanced enough for me to complete my more advanced tasks. Great value for the price.
I'm pretty impressed especially with the price tag being 30 bucks!
This is my 2nd Amazon Fire and I prefer my previous one only because I don't care for all the advertisements that pop up while I'm trying to do things on this one. Otherwise, it has good speed, clear screen, and is easy to navigate.
I like the size and battery life. It would be nice to have instant definitions for foreign language books. I really like the vocabulary review.
Gave this as a Christmas gift to my uncle because he has been given other tablets that did perform as they advertised. I have asked him several time if he is still enjoying the Fire and his answer has always been yes. I also purchased one for myself as well and it has continued to perform as well as it did on the first day I started it up. It is also a great tablet for someone who is a first time user of this type of technology. I would purchase another one should the need arise without giving it a second thought.
Nice built tablet. You need to note that it has Amazon Store, and no Google Play Store.
Great tablet, with lots of apps and good games for playing.
Easy to use and setup. Good features and apps are easy to download.
Not user friendly, in regards to compatibility with Google Play services, Play Store, etc. Definitely needs to be improved upon
Very easy to use,Great selection of titles to download. Screen is very easy to read
Purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation Kindle Paperwhite. The backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker  opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.The one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation Paperwhite is the way it's manufactured  when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the e-ink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. At first I thought this was a manufacturing defect, so I took it back to Best Buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except more-visible.This appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. When the Paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of Amazon's e-reader line, and Amazon was careful to precision-craft the devices. Now, that honor falls to the more-expensive Voyage, with the Paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the Kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the Paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the Voyage.This won't be a huge annoyance for some people. It is for me. And it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting Amazon over.For everyone else, though, this is a great e-reader and well worth the money. If you're looking for an e-reader, this is the one to buy.
Got this tablet for my mom who isn't very tech savvy. She loves it. Can't beat the price
Love the battery life & it's light to hold. Love!!
Very good product especially if you are into high end hq tv products fast easy to operate
This device is so cool. I must buy for all gadget guys.
I use it mostly for fun games, although I listen to books on it too.
This is an excellent device, however, I did take this back and exchanged it for an 8 which I simply love.
I bought this for a needy child for Christmas. I love mine so I'm sure they enjoyed it.
Really a nice laptop for a good price. Also very good service from the salesman.
Great product. Very easy to set up and reliable. Voice recognition is almost perfect and very fast. It provides very useful features already with its native services. and it can be further improved with additional skills.It's a perfect device if you have it linked to some smart-home device, as it provides a centralized and integrated home-management platform.I have not had the change to compare it to other similar devices, like Google Home. Anyway, given the reviews and the quality of the device, and the huge amount of options to expand it via additional devices, like echo dot, echo show and other gadgets, as well as the additional skills, I would certainly recommend it.
Awesome for kidsIt's educationalI love the blue cover!!!
This is a good tablet for the money. Recommended for first time tablet owners.
Something new for my wife. She is still earning how to navigate the item but enjoys more apps at her finger tips. Its small and compact and easy t take on trips so she can read, take pictures or listen to her music.
Echo is more than handy. It's also fun for the grandkids. They have a blast testing Alexa. Works great while internet is functioning. Also bought light bulbs compatible with Echo. They work as advertised.
bought for my niece for Christmas and she love it. cost effective and does what she need it too. Play games an read.
Really really really really really really awesome.
It's actually pretty nice. I bought 2 of them for the kids to keep them quiet around the house or while driving in the car. They've downloaded all sorts of games, and watch movies when they have Wi-FI. Getting started at the beginning was a little tricky setting up a new account, but after that. Everything works just fine. No complaints. I would recommend this product for the little ones for road trips.
Great tablet with a lot of worth apps and everything for a low price.
No better tablet for the price. Amazon continues to produce excellent products.
We bought this for my 86 year old cousin so she could download library books, play card games, and, most importantly, watch what her kids and grandkids post on Facebook. I myself have a Fire and found it very easy to use.
I'm not happy with It, you get what you pay for I will never buy it again.
It was easy to set up and we have loved using it, great for the whole family
I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
It took a couple days to learn to do small things on the echo. After going online and looking up various questions I'm really beginning to enjoy it. I like it so much I bought one for my son. Looking forward to learning and using it more. Just wish more information came with it as far as using it.
Quick and light good for car rides plenty of apps and easy for my 2year old to use
Meets my needs for watching Hulu, Netflix, Youtube
Works in lots of light and very minimal light. Battery seems to last a long time. Finished an entire book (Maze Runner) and the battery indicator barely went down.
Great starter Kindle for the kids. They enjoy the ability to surf.
Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me!
ask yourself if you want a chromcast for 1/3 the cost of this device or do you want to up to PS4 and pretty much get all the features this has and a gaming platform. Then again, you can tweak this system with after market software which you can't on the other two. If you like amazon, are on a budget and have prime, might as well go deeper into the amazon ecosphere.
My husband and I originally bought this for our 1 year old so she could be busy on our longer road trips however when it wasn't being used by her, we would listen to our audio books from audible and it was relaxing and provided good bonding moment . Unfortunately, I left it in the trunk of our rental car and when I called the dealership, they said they didn't find it.. we only had it for about a month!
How to do - not easy to find. Needs quick cheat sheet to accompany the product. I didn't think I'd like the back light but I do. I don't have a computer so it's hard to go on line. I'm not sure if I like how the books are arranged, but I'm slowly learning how to navigate around them. I had one of the original Kindles so changes are sometimes hard for us older people.
Great for reading and relaxing on the eyes with no glare. Will not buy any paper back books anymore
I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend.
Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
Man. I was blown away with this. The voice recognition in fantastic. Answers almost all questions. Very helpful.
Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
Alexa is great. She plays music for me, tells me the news, tells me jokes, reminds me to get to my appointments. She sometimes misinterprets my requests. She's not perfect. She helps me with yoga.
This product is really cool and fun to have. Hooked from day one.
We ordered one for each of our 2 boys (ages 7 and 5) as Christmas gifts. They love them. Setup took a bit of time to get the Amazon store and parental controls, but well worth the time once its was all set up. We set it all up before wrapping them so the kids could enjoy them right away. It's their favorite gift this year.
Got the Echo for my husband who just loves it. I think it has become his best friend
I purchased this to put in my ShowroomEvery customer that comes in remarks about how great the sound is and the station we have on from pandora
My daughter loves this Kindle. It is so easy to upload new books and doesn't hurt your eyes while reading.
My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
Great personal assistant. Sometimes when music is playing loud Alexa can't here or understand the commands. Speaker is more powerful than expected. Ties in nicely with smart home appliances. Looks like this is more compatible with 3rd party devices than the Google Home.
This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
Good you guys did a goood job nice workers good job
The Amazon Tap is a portable Bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice. You can instruct it to play music, order products and services, control home automation products and connected devices, plus a whole lot more.It contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands. It also has Dolby stereo speakers for playing music. The Amazon Tap is basically the portable version of the popular Amazon Echo that was released last year.Ive been testing the Tap for several days now. Heres what I think so far: What I Like I find that the Tap understands my verbal commands accurately. This could be due to the fact that, since its button activated, Im always very close to the device when I speak to it. Nevertheless, its nice that Tap understands me the first time. This was my experience with the Amazon Echo as well.The audio is surprisingly good for such a small device. I test portable speakers all the time and Id say the Amazon Tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range. Don't expect Bose type sound or deep bass levels, however.No other portable speaker device offers voice control and Wi-Fi streaming. Thus the Amazon Tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers. This is especially true if you already have Amazon Prime and Prime Music.It supports many great services. Like the Amazon Echo that came before it, the Amazon Tap supports popular music services such as Prime Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.Battery life has been good so far. I used it off and on for a couple days without charging it. Ill post an update once I have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life.Read more
I bought this as a gift for my husband. He uses it every day. It is easy to read on.
My husband is bed bound and sometimes very weak. The kindle is great for him ,light easy to use and the back light allows him to read in bed without waking me to turn the lights on.
Works great ! Geating this one for my grandson for Christmas! He plays with his sisters now ! Well protected when they drop them ! Great learning experience !
I thought this would have a better sound than the Google Home Assistant based on price ($50 more when not on sale) and description of speaker. Ran the two side by side and I thought the Google Home had a better sound. Neither one is a main speaker in my room but sometimes it is easier to just ask them to play a station on Pandora or Radio than going to the main sound system. As for what Alexa can and can't do...that is tough to say since we don't have any smart devices in the house at that moment. It works well for quick weather, news and traffic reports but not so good for a free-form question. Google was more intuitive and better at understanding the question. With Alexa, if you have not downloaded the "skill" then there is a chance that she won't understand. Still, she is very good at keeping track of shopping lists and at some point I will add smart lights, thermostats, garage door opener, etc. to the house so hopefully the convenience will make things better.
This is a very very good product. I would recommend this to anyone.
Nice for my daughter good product reliable easy Carrington convenient
Very loud. Great sound. Sub Slides under couch so it doesn't get stepped on
I love my new kindle fire HD8!!! It is a great tablet for all ages and easy to navigate!!!! I highly recommend this tablet for everyone!!
The tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we're avid Apple users however the games that's are free in the free time area are amazing the way that Amazon takes measures to keep the kids safe is like non other I'd definitely recommend this product just if you're used to Apple it will take some getting used to.
I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
Siri at home - it is great when hooked up to lighting, music, etc.
I like this and the price is right enjoying it now
Purchased as a gift and the owner loves the functionality and size of the tablet.
Recommended every day. Great Customer service also fast shipping.
This tablet was awesome. My kids enjoy their time on it and it is virtually indestructible. I would highly recommend this tablet for all kids not just for the tough wear and tear but also the parents security settings very good. I highly recommend this product to all parents looking for a good tablet for their kids to enjoy.
My kids love it but if you have ti many apps on the tablet it won't work until you free up some space
Bought this instead of the echo dot and I'm glad I did. The speaker on this is really good. Very useful product.
Good way to get started for kids to play with and they can learn
Pretty good tablet I use it for my 2 year old daughter she really likes it. Very practical small travel size device for when we are traveling back & forth on the road. Very sturdy keep charge long time a reliable piece of technology for my family & for my tech needs
Although it looks like a tall can it's much more it a talking can
I bought four of these for.my kids for xmas. They haven't put them dwn willingly yet! I think it was a great deal for a great product!
As I age, it's difficult for me to see the smaller screens so when this one came out .... I was delighted!!! Love playing my games!!!
I've purchased a number of these for my grandkids and other family members! They are easy to navigate and have great speed!
I really enjoy my echo. I listen to music, audible books, weather, the news. I talk to my mom with it because I bought her one also. This had a really amazing speaker. It's really great with answering science questions and anything you can find on Wikipedia. The only down side is, Amazon doesn't have a sever like Google does. So there are a lot of questions you may ask that the Echo can't answer. I really recommend this if you have Amazon Prime or the Nest thermometer or any of those smart gadgets that can be controlled with Echo. If you don't have these items or Prime, I would get the Google Home. You can listen to music and books using the different Google apps. With the echo you can order from Prime. You cannot link the Echo with other Echo devices yet to play music on all of them at the same time yet. I'm hoping that will change with time.
The Amazon Fire pad is a great deal for the price. It works great very responsive, does exactly what I want it to do like Netflix, Google and a few games. It doesn't suck :)
I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks.
This was a gift for my wife. She loves it. She uses it everyday. Holds a great charge.
I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an "auto brightness" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase.
This thing is great so much better than the appli tv we got
Before you conclude it does not have enough, look at what it can do and read the specs.
Easy setup and I never get tired of using it. My wife uses Echo all the time.
It helps if your an amazon prime member . You can download a lot more things to do on the tablet
These boxes are must faster than the stock and have more memory. They are not bulky which is nice. The fire stick seems to overheat and I haven't had that problem with the box.
Great little tablet for light surfing and watching shows while cooking. Would be better if had native support for Google Play store.
Great tablet, kids love it and have their own. Easy to use
Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She's have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it.
I love this Kindle. The backlight feature makes it very convenient.
Very easy to setup and use I would definitely recommend this
The Fire TV is the best device to stream PlayStaion Vue. Its super fast and Alexa is amazing.
Excellent product and makes reading books very easy. Very light and allows you to have access to numerous books on the go. The E-paper display makes reading really enjoyable and does not suffer from glare and the harsh back light from the displays on phones and tablets
Excellent product! Smooth flowing lots of great free and paid apps!
Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.
Bought this for my 9 year old. She loves it! Very durable and easy to use. Price is great!
This perfect for my mom who loves to listen to auto book's.
I bought this for my son and it works great. The parental controls are easy to use and I love the curfew option.
I have to start by saying the last thing I wanted or needed was another device in my system. Being an Apple household I would prefer that my AppleTV handle the functions that I purchased the FireTV for, namely Amazon Prime Video. But apparently the feud between Apple and Amazon won't end in favor of their customers, and Amazon won't be building a Prime Video App for ATV.So I picked up a Fire TV and have to say I'm impressed, especially for the price. Many Apps (including Prime Video and Music), Netflix, voice control, even 4K (though I haven't tried that). No AirPlay of course, so I can't get rid of my ATV, and it doesn't integrate with my Macs the way ATV does. Bottom line, I got it for Prime and it does a great job, for a non Apple house it would be all you need.
What a great tablet for for the grand kids.easy to use,can't say how many times it's hit the floor and no damage.
Bought it on sale, couldn't ask for more for such a great product and price!
Very good product. Wish it did more but hoping it's an evolving thing.
It is a good kindle for the money. to much junk on the carousel
Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
The 7" Amazon Fire tablet starts up and loads application real fast and works wonderful. The battery life is not as long as my 7" Fire HDX.
easy to read and great resolution. will probably get another for a family member
We love this tablet and I bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter. She's able to use it with no problems.
I got this for my 2 year old nephew he loves it and it is pretty quick the one down side is that Amazon charges you $15 if you want to remove the adds that are in the lock screen but besides that the device is perfect for him to play games and watch movies
I have enjoyed using Kindles for about 8 years now. This particular one was purchased as a gift for another Kindle user and after looking at the one my Mom has thought this would be the perfect gift for my friend who is an avid reader. and the Black Friday Sale price was unbeatable!!!
Fun product to own. Not much guidance from store staff on product features.
screen works great sound is sufficient all around good tablet
For the price this tables does everything I need. so far.
Fine. Works as expected.
This is my second Kindle Fire. Although the first one still works, I wanted an updated one. It is the perfect size for purse or pocket and does everything I need, even things not available on my iPad. Each version has some changes and that got some getting used to.
We have both the Apple TV and now Fire Stick and I'd have to say that we use the fire stick more. It's user interface is pretty decent once you're use to it and the available apps are great. We honestly have no complaints about it. Also, you can do "a lot more" on these than the other smart devices that don't allow you to use third party apps. Nice to be able to customize your device the way you want, if you ask me.Easy setup and I actually really like the voice activated remote.
I had no cable but had internet so I thought this Amazon item would be good. Basically you have to pay for each subscription to use this making it super costly. I retuned this and just use Netflix with a wifi enabled tv.
I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.
Awesome product. Got two of these for two kids! They really enjoy!
very fast tv stream, netlfix is super fast and good quality
It is an ok tablet. As I am using it, I lose my page quite often and have to go back to find it again. Also, I lose internet connection or am unable to connect at all. For the money, I find it acceptable but not ideal.
Bought this for my wife who swore she would never give up paperback books. Now she uses this one all the time. It's the perfect size to fit in her purse for trips too.
Everything I needed it for. Screen is nice enough and price was right.
Great tablet! My fiancee uses it as an ereader for books she downloads from the library.
This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand.
great item and at a great price. love using it daily.
I own an Apple TV also and content is just as good. Very easy to navigate. I also use my phone's app to navigate thru the menu.
I love my new Panasonic phone system. It has 2 handsets which is a good idea for those living with family! I also like the ease of operating the answering machine as well. Thank you Best Buy!
The Amazon Kindle is the best tablet on the market!
This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need?  My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .
I've had an iPad and iPHone for years, which also allow me to read my kindle library, but the Paperwhite has three advantages: 1) you can see it in bright sunlight, 2) the charge will last for weeks, and 3) because it is much cheaper it is less vulnerable to theft and less of a loss if it is damaged. I bought the Internet version, but it is also available with a connection to the kindle net, which enables you to download books anywhere, even where there is no access to Internet.
Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.
The more I use this, the more reasons I enjoy it. The staff were great and helped me set it up.
We usre the echo alot in the house, even connected to our Harmony Hub and Home Automation to control the house.
Amazing device. I have found so much that can be done without picking up my phone. Love it. You you will be happy you purchased it.
I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.
Bought this tablet for my daughter after having a Nabi in the past. I myself had one of the first generation Fire and loved it. In comparison to the Nabi this is a much better buy! Over all the price and App Store are so much better.
Love the Amazon Echo will recommend this to all my friends.
I purchased this as a gift and it went over very well. She loved it.
Had to chose between Fire 10 and Fire 8. For the money, you can't go wrong with the Fire 8. Screen is good for " older eyes".
This tablet works well for me. I use it mainly for checking my email instead of having to log in into my computer all the time. I don't have a smartphone so it is perfect for me.
I love this tablet i got it for my grandson and the minute he comes through the door he wants his tablet it keeps him busy
good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad
I love that I can ask questions withouto having to go to a computer or cell.
It is just the right size for my sons and daughter!!! They even know how to work it themselves!
I haven't paid much attention to the Fire since the very first one out years back. But recently I purchased an Amazon Echo which I am thoroughly enjoying. And I discovered that my Echo was capable of 'voice casting.' This basically means that whatever Alexa is saying can show up as text or pictures on a screen (recipe or weather map, for example) and you can then print it out! So I wanted to explore voice casting and the easiest way to do that is with an Amazon Fire. What a deal! $50 for the most recent version that boasts all manner of things. I even get free movies! So I purchased a case for the Fire that would work as an easel stand, set it up as a photo frame displaying a rotating series of my digital photos, and whenever I want to I can voice cast from my Amazon Echo! Playing a music album? I can see the album cover and list of songs on my Fire. Checking what's playing at which movie theater when? I can voice cast that info so everyone can see it and vote. And we haven't even talked about using the Fire as an easy go-to for email or games!
Alexa is awesome to use for hearing music. works well!
I bought this for my niece and nephew and they love it!
This is an excellent value. This is easy to read, easy to use and performs like a champ. If you want an all around great reader but don't want to pay a high price, this is the one.
This product is really great, not buffering when watching live streaming.
Love the size and quality. Good price and convinient size.
I really love both Amazon tv and Apple TV as products. I do wish Amazon tv has a simplified AirPlay ability for iOS. I'm sure with apps you buy and other methods you can accomplish it but if it was just standard like Apple TV AirPlay I would give this product 5 stars. For cheap easy price it makes a great gift. Where it beats Apple TV is 4 k streaming. So if you want 4K get Amazon Fire tv.
You really can't get much better bang for your buck! Great Device, a must have
I purchased 2 of these for my 4 & 5 year old grandsons as a Christmas present. They loved them! Easy to use, great screens & volume!
I bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it! I even use it too.
I bought the Fire for my husband who is a senior citizen but does not use a computer. He loves it.
Purchased for an 8 year old. Prefers reading books on the tablet vs hard copy and can play games and watch videos. Well worth the $50 cost
I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good, I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.
serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.
Flawless from Amazon great product and works all the time possibilities endless
This is a great product to purchase I love that you can watch whatever out there too watch with out leaving the comfort of your own home
It's ok, it's good for beginner users, the kids love it because they could play games on it
Great tablet. Love everything about it. Good selection of apps for free. If you decide to buy apps is also worth it. Cheap prices
THIS TABLET SERVE THE PURPOSE ITS PURCHASE FOR, MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND HELPS HER GREATLY WITH HER PLAY TIME
Best Tablet you can buy for the money so hurry and get yours.
SuperA+, smart always ready to answer any question
The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
The tablet has been used for netflix a lot. I am an amazon prime member on a trial basis,so the uses for the tablet are numerous.
A great little tablet for the price. Works well. A gift for my wife to read e-books on but surfs the Internet nicely too.
Decided to go with this along with playstation vue and a couple other subscriptions I already had to cut the cord from cable. This little box is excellent for all sorts of streaming. Shows come in very clear. The response time is great. Only down side is bluetooth and not IR but a nice $20 adapter and boom now my universal remote works with this. Definitely would recommend for anyone looking to cut ties with their cable company.
I bought two of these, one for my son and the other for nephew, they love it. I downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational games they can play besides regular Games.
Love this tablet easy to use. Wonderful color and compact enough to carry.
Great tablet for messing around with or just to have.
I'm on a year's assignment in LA. I've had Amazon Prime for years, but now it's essential to keep track of my programming.
Bought this as a gift for my 7 year old niece and she loves it! It's entertaining and easy enough for her to navigate through!
Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids
Makes book downloading and reading easy as ever. So compact and lightweight too.
Bought this for my 10 year old daughter to use with our homeschool. It's just the right size for her to carry around. Big enough to see videos well but not so big that it's difficult to deal with. We love it.
This is a great amazon fire tablet for kids highly recommend
Works great for my daughter, great price and apps.
I love my Amazon Fire tablet. It's the perfect size to carry in my purse. I shopped around and compared prices prior to my purchase. Best Buy had the lowest price and their customer service was excellent.
OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!
I like the concept of the product. I'm still learning how to use it, but it seems that it may be to pricey to really get the full benefits.
This thing is pretty freakin cool. It's a gadget but a useful one. It's literally Siri for the house. Ask it anything and get the answer or just listen to any type of music in great sound quality. Awesome little thing.
This works wonderful. We cancelled Direct tv and went with is instead. Love it.
I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase.
Purchased during Black Friday sale 2016 as an impulse buy. Great little tablet and great value!
This tablet is great for entertainment purposes especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. Easy to use and access to most entertainment apps make this tablet and easy purchase especially if you get it on sale for less than $50. Great buy!
The amazon fire i bought for christmas works great.
I looked all over for a tablet and Best Buy had only two left so I knew it was meant to be.
This tablet is very well made and well worth the price. Amazon has a great market place and the tablet has a nice clear picture and the touch screen functions very well. Got it for my 3 year old son and he loves it plus I like that it has parental controls so I can block out things I don't want him accessing...
I was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but I am impressed! The 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. I read negative reviews about the video quality but I have not had any issues and use it to watch Netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. The amazon App Store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty.
Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.
This is as much fun as I expected it to be. Love that I can play music and change songs hands free while cooking.
Item as described!!!! Excellent media center !!! Esasy to install !!!
by far the best streaming box out there i loved the first one too but all the new stuff on this one is wow 4 times faster and better wifi cant go wrong love it if you aint got one go get it this is rhe game changer !
Love this.. Would buy so many times if I had more tvs
The Amazon Fire is a great device and for a great price! This new device now has a camera where as our older version did not!
The device is good for reading on. It feels like reading a book.
This is a great product. I already had wifi thermostats so when I bought my echo is connected very easily. Setup for the echo was quick and easy and I now have light bulbs I can control with it also. It's a great and fun product.
For the price, it's the best tablet you're going to find. It's pretty quick (though not as quick as the more expensive models) and holds a ton of books and a decent amount of movies. Display is nice (again, not as nice as the more expensive Kindle Fires). But it is totally worth what I paid for it.
Fantastic new Kindle. Very slim and light. Easy to carry and secure in baggage. Much clearer display and cool new features.
Works super well, always plays good music and movies
I'm very proud to have one of these. Best product I've purchased so far
I like the Echo, but after I heard about Google home I am considering returning this one to try Google Home. For less money, and more capabilities, I think the Google Home may be a better choice.
This tablet is very good for someone that has an Amazon Prime account. You can download movies and games from the Amazon app store.
This is a.great product. Glad I cut the cable wire
GREAT INEXPENSIVE ITEM. EASY TO USE. KIDS LOVE TO USE IT
Bought as gift and have been very satisfiedGood sound and wonderful life aid
Such a neat addition to our home. Alexa keeps up with my shopping list and reminders. Plus, my son loves her games and stories!
Fire tv is easy to set up and navigate. As seniors we were concerned about the ease of use.
Got this as a gift for someone, easy to set up and they are enjoying it immensely.
I love this tablet.I bought it for my 5year old grandson and he lives it. The parental controls are outstanding
I think the Echos are terrific personal assistants. This is my second large Echo. I like the larger speakers in the big Echo. But I also like the Dots well enough to buy five of them. Alexa is all over my house!
I love my new colored kindle. I can do anything I want with this one. I used to have the old kindle so wanted to upgrade. Great choice
Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places.
Nice tablet from Amazon, has a good screen on it and plenty of memory.
bought this for my 8 year old daughter. She loves it and I love that it comes with a great parental controls set up. I can let her have some freedom with apps and internet and be fairly confident that anything inappropriate is blocked. I can also set it up so that I can review her activity later on. Only reason it got 4 stars, not 5 is the battery life. I have a Samsung galaxy tablet also, and it lasts several hours longer than the fire tablet with similar use.
works fine
great product used by all ages and everyone love it
Summary says it all really. It works, but its not really very useful.
She listens and does what she's told. The whole family loves Alexa.
this kindle paperwhite new generation is really good.the display has been improved from the older version.its clear and easy to read than the older one.
amazon fire 7 inch tablet is a great product and works great and no issues
Purchased this device for a three year old. He loves it.
Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that
Glad I upgraded to the Fire Kindle as it is much easy to read on than the black and white Kindle I had previously. The color and graphics are very clear. It is easy to work on for many tasks, and the search mode is great.
I really enjoy my new kindle. I can read in the dark, I can have all my books without taking up space, and the battery lasts a long time.
This tablet was recommended to me by a friend. It's definitely a great buy!
this is great for the price. It is slow on certain application.
Love my Echo! I brought it home and started playing with it. I had Alexa playing music, setting alarms, getting weather information. I have begun to rely on Alexa for a number of things. So glad I made this purchase.
One of the best streaming devices available currently especially for the cost. The app store gives you access to all the major streaming services - Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, etc. The only knock on it is that it places heavy focus on Amazon Prime videos for obvious reason. As a side benefit (pun intended) - you can put SPMC/Kodi/XBMC on it like I have and combined with a HDHOMERUN it is now a cable box replacement. It is the only box I have plugged into my TV and use it for Live TV, DVR, Movies, Videos, Pictures, and all the streaming apps. Powerful little unit that saves on electricity and space compared to HTPC that was hooked up before. No more monthly cable box rental fee's so it pays for itself in a few months.
The product met my need. Runs very smoothly with an occasional lag but nothing significant, Greatly exceeded previous box I had which constantly lagged and had problems loading. Mind you this box cost doubled the cost of the Amazon box
I love the small size as it is very comfortable to hold... the look and feel is very much like an actual book!!
My kids are on their tablets for hours on end. I was able to download several preschool apps for them. They actually are learning very well. The tablet us simple to use and they can navigate themselves on the tablet very easily.
I'm returning it because a new version is coming i
We have been truly enjoying our Echo. The music is great. We use Pandora quite a bit. The local weather and news is also very timely.Still have much to learn on how to use the many fabulous features. And the weekly email updates are very helpful.Very good product for the home and easy to set-up.
I bought this for my kids as a gift. They love this device and use it daily. I couldn't be happier with the purchase
sweet product beats older ones by a mile! I checked out others but this was the best all around e reader hands down. I read at all times very easy to read at night time with little light. Easy too get what ever you want to read .
nice pickup for my wife who is just learing to use a tablet
I bough this for my husband and he loves it so much uses it everyday!! Worth ever penny!
Love the speed and apps offered through the unit. Had eliminated most of the buffering issues I've had with other streaming sticks.
I bought this for my bedroom. I have it to control lighting and wake me up. Awesome.
The echo works well. It was easy to setup, functions as advertised. Very good response and reacts well to our voices.Good device.
Very fast. Does everything you need it to at a great price.
For the price this is a great tablet. Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.
The tablet is great for my 3 years she loves it very easy
We are enjoying Amazon Echo, but have had problems trying to set up my husband and my music to play. My husband had to contact Amazon service department to guide him on setting up, but we still struggled in getting music to play from our cell phones and our computers.
This eReader is great, I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it.
I've always been a big roku fan and have a few amazon fire sticks, but decided to give this a shot. I am much happier with the Fire TV over the Fire Stick. The processing power allows streaming home videos to be much smoother than the stick and the updated interface is now better than the roku.
Have no complaints. The Paperwhite has opened up a whole new world for me because my eyes do not get tired.
Love the case it helps the tablet be safe so the screen doesnt break to easy
Counting back, this is my 5th Kindle since they came out. I've never had to replace one that "died", but sometimes I want the newer features. This one is to replace the older "books only" unit that is starting to be un-cooperative that I take to work for reading during lunch. I'd have probably just gotten another "reading only" unit, like a paperwhite, but these were less expensive.Pluses, can carry movies, music, etc, like my Kindle HD Fire. Can easily let me shop on Amazon, can access free "underground" apps, (i really don't need it for games though), and it is simple to use.Minus, uses power quickly, like the Kindle Fire HD, I have to charge it daily to every other day. I set a password (VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), to prevent unauthorized uses or purchases. It has given me minor problems with books by marking that I was on a different page than where I stopped, and it "links" to the other Kindles and they go to that page as well. For some reason, accessories, like cases are more expensive. If you want to store a good deal more, you require an SD chip, ($11 for 32 GB).
I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic.
This the best streaming device out there. If your looking for a great and fast streaming device this it it for sure. You can't go wrong with it. Super fast and no buffering
Bought it as a gift for my brother. He loves it and has no complaints
I bought this to put in my room to use with prime music. Works great, Alexa is way smarter than Siri. With the Alexa app or another echo device you can drop in and use as intercom.
Great addition to the home can take it to various spots in the home clear sound! User friendly, and easy to sync. Set up make sure u download the App in advance
I got the kindle so that I could read books outdoors. Tablet has a glare and can't see screen. This is perfect. Easy set up easy to sync.
Sounds great, easy to use. Love the shopping list feature
i love this tablet. but my only complaint is the battery life. it sucks.
The best gift for my 2 years old nieceGreat tablet
I have a kindle paperwhite 2 before and just updated my machine. The recent machine presents much more clear and reaches 300 ppi. Besides the price is much more welcome
Great tablet for the price, the only problem I have had is getting it linked to Mr printer.
The Echo works very well for the music lover and children that like to ask it questions. I tried it out for a few weeks and I decided it wasn't for me. I seldom listen to music unless I'm in my car. It was too much money to just sit there idle. It is a great product for the right person and it has a lot of potential.
My only knock against this product is my girlfriend uses it so much I barely have a chance to read on it.
Enjoy the small device as well the many features it offers. Will have to get use to the remote but otherwise okay. Price arrange also okay by it being an Apple's product.
My grandaughter is enjoying this tablet. I would recommend to all parents for their young kids.
Great price for an awesome tablet. Awesome tablet to read my books.
I have been wanting a tablet and numerous family members suggested the Amazon Fire tablet. I was afraid that the 7" size would not be large enough but it is working out perfectly for me! It's size makes it extremely easy to carry and the graphics are amazing. I am sooo happy that I decided to get this tablet. It truly is a (forgive the pun) "Best Buy"
my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.
I had always wanted to try one of these out. I finally got my chance while staying with some friends in Vegas. I though it was so cool how you could ask Alexa just about anything and she would have a response. From playing a certain genera of music, to top news stories, Alexa does it all. After that trip I knew that I was going to get one.
Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it.
I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device.
Easy to use, loves the green case and durable. Great gift.
Excellent all the way around. Enjoy camera to take pics of surprised looks on peoples faces.
Wish the Amazon fire had more connections, i.e. Optical option.
I love this tablet! Perfect size, great graphics and speed. Purchased this on sale during the holidays - great value!
Bought this for my daughter to play learning games on and to watch movies on in the car. It is great!!! It was easy to setup a kids account so I could limit what she had access too, and I got to pick what she could see! Great features for all the family!
This is an excellent product especially for the price
The best bang for the buck in streaming tv. Buy 1 for each tv
The Echo has simplified so many things- turning on the lights, checking the weather, playing music. I'd hate to think about what life was like before!
I have not set up tablet, geeks squad to do so Monday April 3 2017
Great buy. Deff worth the money. Much faster than my phone
The Amazon Echo is a great device. I find it particularly useful for home automation.
To be honest, I think the Fire TV is a way better investment than Apple TV. Highly recommended!
easy to operate and very handy and good for the price.
Great value for the price. Not as user friendly as the original Kindle Fire but still a good starter tablet for those that are less tech savvy.
Bought this for vacation electronics. Music, magazines, audibles and books in one reasonably priced piece. Didn't worry about my expensive mobile phone and iPad being at the beach or in the car or elements.
Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.
Rapid charge is always good!
Wish I could download Google Docs but otherwise very happy with my kindle fire.
Easy to use and does what you ask. Has a lot of knowledge and is full of information. Was amazed at what Alexa can do.
It was only forty-nine bucks - - how can anyone complain too much? It's fine. It's adequate. No problems. Smallish screen. The missus uses it to sit on the couch and look at her Facebook. She says it's okay.
I got this for 35 on black Friday which is the best deal for a tablet but still 0 getting this for 50 is a good deal
I feel that it is a good product for reading a book, especially since you can carry many books with you instead of "carrying" the actual books. I thought it would be a brighter screen than others but am a little disappointed in that regard.
my moms favortie gift of chrismas 2015. i would recommend is product over and over.
This unit is just like a member of the family, it answers questions, plays my favorite music and gives me reminders!
Not a bad tablet, BUT not an amazing tablet. It costs 50 dollars for a reason. It is a basic tablet, kind of like having a bigger iPhone 3, if you get the reference.
Saw this on TV decided to look into it purchased it and loved it
I needed a tablet which I can use without worrying about damaging it. This is perfect for that purpose.
Cut cable down to basic cable and now rent any shows that I watch directly from Amazon. Didn't realize how little TV I watched until I cancelled and went to Fire TV. My house is wired for LAN and I connect directly into the wall using a cat5 cable and have 80mps speed to the Fire TV. No issues with lag or buffering at all. 4k movies is a plus as well.
The paperwhite is significantly better to use for reading than any other brands.
Bought this for my mother who is 84. Excellent tablet for the beginner.
This was purchased for a 2nd TV. No issues- love it
The Amazon Echo is the most amazing device you can add to your home. It makes everything more convenient. I highly recommend it to everyone.
I bought this as a replacement for my wife's old Kindle 3g. I got the wifi version only since she rarely used the 3g. I have to say that this version is much nicer in some ways and is lacking in others. My wife really misses the physical keyboard, but she has quickly gotten used to the touch-screen. The dpi is MUCH better, and the screen is much easier to read. The refresh times are a lot better. I don't see there being a need to upgrade if yours is currently working, but you shouldn't hesitate if you're in the market for an excellent e-book reader.
Great tablet but doesn't hold a charge for a long needs a better battery but overall it's a good tablet
Love the idea that this tablet is expandable to 128GB. The Ipad Mini 2 that I also have does not compare even close to this tablet, as it is not expandable beyond its 16GB. Overall, just an outstanding tablet.
Small enough to carry and works fast enough for small jobs
This is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. The unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. Finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to Amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. Awesome deal for the price.
I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now.
I got this from my son as a Birthday gift. I am a low tech mom, so I'm still learning on how to use it. So far I listen to the news, musics, timers, telling jokes. Next on my list is cooking & more. If a low tech mom like me can use it, anyone can use it too.
The future is here, the best voice recognition I've ever used, along with intelligence and responsiveness.
The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.
The new tablet is great ！ nice upgrades！Love how easy it is to use. Easy to get apps, shop and browse the web.
I ordered this from online and was worried that it would not function as well as the Amazon Kindle Fire. To my surprise, my children love them! The product was well priced, as well as having great features. I couldn't have brought a better Christmas present for them. I allowed them to customize and wrap their Amazon Fires. They can't wait to open it on Christmas day, as my 5 year old asks "is it Christmas yet" every day now lol...I would definitely recommend the purchase of this as well as the protection, it's worth it!
The Kindle Fire I purchased at Best Buy is awesome for people to read books online and search the web. It is one of a kind!
This is my 3rd Fire TV and they all have performed very well.
I bought this for my daughter. I like that there are security features. She enjoys it and I have peace of mind!!
It's a cheap tablet that you can just give to your kids or whatever. The ads are annoying but then again you can't expect too much with the price point. However, I would not recommend using this for any kind of work at all because it's very slow and finicky at times but if you're tired of giving your kids your phone/tablet this is the product for you. Just make sure you take off your payment info, maybe even make their own personal amazon account.
my son loves it. I have bought him tablets before but he never liked them as much. this one is easier to use.
Easier than reading a book. I don't know why I didn't buy one years ago.
This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus, the hands free mode works just like the Dot, and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time; working on projects, making shopping lists, playing games, to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.
This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
I love this tablet, and use it as an eReader mainly. I love how this is capable of reading my books to me (if they're compatible). My favorite feature for sure! Thay way I can listen while I'm cleaning the house and my kids love to listen to them too. It bluetooths to a bigger speaker without a problem. Tactically the screen is so nice, i love the feel. The Internet browser is a but clunky, so if thats your main desire.. This may not be the best. I feel it does well for my needs. I have found most apps to suit my needs on the amazon app store.
Whether you need the weather, information about something, a recipe or even just music, the Echo is right there to help. I haven't even used a third of the ability of the Echo but am very impressed with what I have used.
Love this new addition. The light feature really helps
After using my son's echo. I just had to have one . We now purchased a Dot and a Bluetooth speaker for the wife to use in her bathroom for getting ready each morning and she also just loves it. It can do so many more things than we first thought. Great addition to our home.
I can watch tons of stuff in my TV who needs cable now days
I purchased two of these tablets and I absolutely love them! Super "snappy" with response time with hardly and lag. Easy to charge as well as install any apps you may want. Streams videos very well and for the price point it's a great buy. Highly recommended!
I went from an Amazon Fire stick to this tv and there is literally no lag in response time!
Can be educational and lots of fun too. A variety of uses for Alexa.
My only regret is not purchasing Amazon Echo sooner. She keeps me up to date with weather, significant events for the day, can sing happy birthday and plays my favorite music. No more plugging in cords from phone to speakers and blah blah blah...I couldn't be more satisfied. Thank you Alexa!
We got this item for my parents to use - who are not the most tech savvy - and even they love to use it! It took them a few days to catch on and fully understand how it works and why its so great but now they each want one of their own
We bought a second one for my mom. (The kids couldn't keep her off of theirs) Great speaker quality, customizable (we all can listen to our favorite music), fun/helpful features with Alexa, easy to use. Looking forward to using some smart features to help my mom even more.
Its no ipad or samsaung but it works i dont have a problem with it. And the price was great on black Friday
Amazon echo is excellent all it does is make you lazy haha! Get it!
Son-in-law asked for this as a Christmas gift. Wanted something to take along on business trips for easy access to books and/or games. He is very pleased with it.
I bought the Echo for my 30 year old daughter. She loves it. Very useful and works great. Easy to use.
I bought this as a gift for my wife along with an Echo DOT. She loves it. Easy to setup and use.
love my kindle the store was clean and well laid out.
Thank You
I love it, very user friendly! Great for the kids, lots of aps, great purchase and great price!
So easy to move from room to room. We also take it on trips with us. Plug into any HDMI use the hotel internet and boom. All set.
I am very happy with this purchase. Keeps my grandsons entertained. Easy to set up and use.
I would highly recommend purchasing Alexa! Make sure to get all of the updates that she is capable of. for example you can do sleep sounds. She will even tell you the weather Sports excetera
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She reads books and plays games.
i love these thing buy them for my friends all the time
This is a good alternative to the amazon echo. I like that supposedly it's not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to Alexa.
We bought it for our granddaughter and she absolutely loved it!
Got this for my mom. She likes it. Thumbs up on this one.
Great gift for a kid to read, surf and play music!
My kids love it ... could be a little more user friendly for kids.
I purchased 3 of these Kindle's for my grandchildren and 1 for my husband for Christmas! They loved them and they were a very good price! I then bought myself one!
Thanks children are help but changed don't work good.
This is a great streaming box. It's is more than I expected.
Ok for kids to mess around with, but not very good quality
Alexa works a lot easier than Siri, Alexa is more like an personal assistant. Works great!!
So we have been getting our home setup for automation for a while now. Buying one piece at a time and implementing them makes the cost less scary! We have a Wink hub, Cree LED lights, MyQ garage door opener, AT&Ts Digital Life security and automation, Nest thermostat, etc. It has been a blast getting all of this working together and seeing how it can really benefit us in real life rather than in cheesy video clips on YouTube of people smiling and hugging while they turn the thermostat down a degree with their phone. You may be wondering how the Echo fits into this review...well before Alexa came into our lives we had to have a phone or tablet on us, unlock it, find the relevant app, open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do. Now, we just say, "Alexa, bedroom light 10%" or "Alexa, turn the bedroom lamp off" or "Alexa, play Bloodhound Gang on Spotify", etc. The Echo makes utilizing your home automation much easier, plus with the ever growing list of 'skills' I can start my car, play a game, listen to music, get my news, control media playback, order a pizza, buy stuff from Amazon, even schedule an Uber pickup, etc. If your specific car or app or whatever isn't available yet, just give it some time and it'll most likely end up supported! Very, very cool technology!
We love our echo, Alexa! We use her all the time. Synched to our phones, and she's almost more helpful than a spouseRecommend this to any and everyone
Great deal for the money. My daughter loves it and I'm glad.
Had previously owned the fire tv stick to see how it would work, and i was impressed with everything it offered, so this full size Fire TV was just as good with faster internet (since it is now hardwired with ethernet cable) and has more memory. connecting was easy and everything was easy to scroll through. Having an amazon prime account gives you even more selections.
Grandma loves it..plays her games and keeps up with the grandkids.
I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product.
I like it its good for the kids to play with and easy to use.
Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.
I purchased the Amazon Fire TV because I wanted to be able to watch Sony Vue in the bedroom without having to get another Playstation console. We have an Apple TV (newer model), and I like it a lot too, but the Fire TV allows me to watch both Amazon Prime content and the Sony Vue channels, which I can't on my Apple TV. The Amazon Fire TV is very responsive, has great Apps, it is lightweight and doesn't take up much room. In fact, we have it hanging in the back of our TV which is mounted to the wall, and you can't even see it. I highly recommend it.
My second Kindle fire. Lives up to Amazon'so description
I sideloaded the .apk file for the Opera web browser from GetJar.com. Works flawlessly since FireOS is based upon Android. Nice little tablet all around.
Very easy to set up and connect to the wireless network.
My 6year old twin boys loves technology and the Fire 7 Tablet is perfect for them. Just the right size to sit and play or pack and go. The icons are super easy to understand for beginners as such. I've downloaded fun games, apps, and books for them to utilize already. The price was awesome as well especially since I purchased two at the same time.
Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.
I have loved using Amazon Fire to watch movies and TV shows on Amazon Prime. The user interface is easy to operate, and is even better than Apple TV.
Best price I've seen on a tablet that does all what I needed it to do... Just simple things
I have the Amazon Echo in my kitchen where we run around and usually holding food in our hands while prepping or rushing out. It's nice to be able to just call out a certain song or music station to quickly start hearing some music while busy. Also, if we are in a rush to leave and want to know the temperature to make sure to have proper attire. This device just makes life a little simpler and faster.
Bought a tablet first had for a month hated it. Replaced it with kindle other people recommended. Love it
I don't have a smart home, but it does so much more than that! I got mine strictly for my own entertainment! I have not been disappointed! My daughter has a smart home and I got to see what it did for her. While controlling her lights and thermostat is nice, I am happy with playing my favorite songs. It will give me the forecast as I lie in bed! It sang me happy birthday!!!! I am still finding all of the neat things it can do!!!
We got this just before Christmas and have really enjoyed having it. My 7 year old loves playing 20 questions, asking random questions and checking the weather. We do have many of our lights throughout the house where Alexa will control them as well as the Nest thermostat. The music selection is pretty expansive with just what comes with Prime, but we may upgrade the music. Liked it so much we bought two dots for the bedrooms and have them hooked up to speakers. Alexa isn't perfect, but neither is Siri. Overall it's been a great purchase for our family.
For the price it's an awesome deal the tablet is wonderful and will do everything that I want it to do for my 4 and 2.5 year old. It doesn't have a ton of storage but that's okay we will be using ours for Netflix and coloring games while traveling!
But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.
This is a modern era personal assistant. Has almost all answers you ask & is still learning. Kids are getting use to it sometimes play and also getting educated. Very impressed with the sound quality has Dolby sound if you like listening music.
This is my 1st Kindle bough for my wife, later on bought another one for myself , we both love it, most important it wont hurt our eyes and battery last for weeks without charging it.
First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying "features" that are on but can and should be turned off. The "on-deck" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the "Amazon Store" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions.
Got it for a Christmas gift. She loves it. She stays on it all the time.
A must have for your baby or child!! 100% Free apps!!
Still learning about my Echo but so far just love it!
This box is as good or better than my Apple TV (latest version) with more options.
The kindle is light and easy to use. Was able to get up and running within 10 minutes. Easy to charge. Programs are easy to view for older eyes. Perfect starter technology for the no tech generation.
I've had the Apple TV, Cromecast, and Amazon Fire and Amazon has the most options that fit what I watch and use not to mention it has the best HD quality I highly recommend it
This tablet is just what the kids needed. It's easy to use.
Great product although it was a bit of a wait....packed well for shipping..will order again
I bought this for my wife for Christmas she loves it . Sounds great
I love product and features keep updating.I love the updates of things Alexa can do.
Alexa is more useful if you have Amazon prime only
Bought this because a family member was reading on an iPhone and wanted a bigger screen. Works well and is a fun tablet for the price!
Powerful little tablet. Wish it had more apps available, but for the price, you can't beat it.
This a good tablet. How ever I made it better by putting cyanogen mod on this to use the full android operating system
Solid piece of equipment, very reliable and streams great, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Nice quick charge gives full power level. I like how it is labeled amazon so I can clearly identify it and not be confused by other chargers!
This tablet is one of the best.You won't regret buying this one.Good work,Amazon.
Easy to navigate with plenty of apps. Simple connection
I purchased it with a discounted price and now it seems pretty worthy and durable. Kindle's the best and most comfortable e-reader for my everyday use. I love it and put it in my bag everyday.
Bought it for kids to play with and not have to worry about kids breaking it since the price is okay. Also use it as a mean to do video chat. OK video quality, not too bad.
I have purchased several tablets under 100 dollars and this is by far the best quality. The picture is much better then the other tablets. I gave it a 4 only because I still like my samsung tablet better.
For $50 I couldn't ask for more! Aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books, I can listen to music, download apps, play games, watch videos, take photos/ record videos (front & rear facing camera), check emails, and surf the web. Although you have to pay for most book/video purchases Amazon also offers Amazon Prime for a month free ($9.99 after) which makes some purchases less expensive. You can also tack on Kindle Unlimited (free 1st month, also $9.99 a month after) to download up to 10 Kindle Unlimited books at a time. As for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads (which is why this tablet is so cheap!). If this bothers you, you can remove the ads for $15 on Amazon. The screen/camera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price! The glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome, but I purchased an anti-glare screen protector to resolve that issue. With the holidays approaching this is the perfect gift for those on a budget! This would have been the perfect gift for me, had I not already purchased it for myself!
Bought the Kindle for xmas gift,the young lady really loves it she reads books on it.
I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love.
My parents (in their 60's) were the ones that turned us on to Echo and Alexa - yeah, I know! We really love it and are just scraping the surface of its capabilities.
Easy to set up and very convenient to operate. The sound is very good.
I gave this Fire 7" tablet five stars because of the price and quality. You won't find another for the price with so many good features. I purchased it primarily for reading books from Amazon and my library. The screen is excellent. This tablet can enlarge the size for best reading comfort. The sound is very good and it's best when connecting to a set of speakers. There's an advertisement when first logging on, which is not too annoying, (to pay $15 to remove). It's great for beginners and anyone who wants a light, compact tablet to carry around. I also have a 10" Samsung, but this was difficult and heavy to hold while reading. I also purchased a case to protect the Fire 7". It makes holding the tablet easier. I can't say enough good things about this tablet. The screen, sound and speed while browsing the internet are very good These were most important to me. I highly recommend the Amazon Fire 7" Tablet.
Perfect price and just enough memory for anything. Perfect size great quality this is the 5th one I bought for someone. Pictures are great also
Other family member want same product...............
I just upgraded from a Touch to a Voyage and could not be happier. In my opinion this is by far the best Kindle yet. Its operation and features are similar to the Touch and Paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. Like other e-ink devices (unlike Fire) the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. Some early reviews I've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. I have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. The built-in screen light is amazing.Like other e-ink devices the Voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries in-situ to fully understand a word or phrase.There is very little not to like about the Voyage. I can only think of two issues to consider:1. Price - no doubt about it, Voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. When trading off price and performance, I urge you to go into your nearest Best Buy for a hands-on look at the various Kindles, particularly the Paperwhite and Voyage to see what you really need/want or can live with.2. A minor point for the evolution of e-ink readers: it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. Recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with bright-white or bluish screens (disrupts melatonin production in the body). This is one (of the few in my opinion) advantages of Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android, where several text background colors are available).I highly recommend Voyage - the new king of e-readers.
Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
i am happy with my purchase of alexa, it is user friendly aand easy to learn i also find it convienient and time saveing in its ability to adapt, has some quirks but nothing major overall a joy toown and use.
Love my kindle fire, takes awesome pictures and its convenient for on the go.
I bought this for my 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy!
Easy to use. Memory fills up fast though. Battery life is decent.
Not a cheap plug from the check out, this works for my phone and kindle without the nasty reminder that the cord or plug are not strong enough.
It's good and fast. It does what you want it for. I use it mainly for reading and my son plays a few games on it. Alright product.
Excellent for travel, games, email, small enough to carry
Great tablet for kids and beginners, I would recommend for anyone looking for an easy to use tablet.
Purchased for my son for ease of use and design. Would recommend.
I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of "back" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the "X" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of "new items." The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under "new items" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the "home" menu. It's the "recent" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's "On Deck" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the "on deck" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.
I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it.
This thing is awesome, I had a firestick and then I upgraded to the FireTV and it is much faster and much smoother. It is a 2015 model and I am not sure if it will be upgraded in the near future but it is pretty decent in 2017. Also much easier and user friendly than the Apple TV also cheaper,
Bought this kindle because my library has limited supply of large print books. Now I can control font size of print. Easy on my eyes with backlit screen. Convenient to carry in my bag. Long lasting battery. Happy reader.
For the fundamentals of tablet use this one works great!
I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Get a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift.
Got 3 on Black Friday for as gifts. My parents loved it and they manage to set it up by themselves so it's definetly user friendly
Does everything I expected, it was very easy to hook up
I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again.
The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person!
The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices...
INEXPENSIVE AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL. WORKS AS GOOD AS TOP BRANDS.
I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price.
Yes, no problem it works great
The Echo simply performs as advertised. The function that prompted the purchase was integration with the Harmony remote I use for my home theater system. Once installed, I discovered some of the other things the Echo can do. As an example, it has the ability to control my Phillips Hue lighting system components that help set the mood in the theater. It isn't perfect but the list of capabilities continues to grow. You will like it.
Great for reading books and digital comics and the perfect entry-level tablet for Amazon's grand ecosystem. If you like this, you can upgrade in the future to something with more storage and power.
We have a tv that already has Netflix and Amazon but still wanted all our other apps that you just can get on other devices. We love this this thing and highly recommend it just ask Alexa for stuff instantly you have music, movies, and shopping.
Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it.
Liked this product so much that I have purchased two more and plan on buying more for all our televisions.
Plays everything we ask. Alexa knows all the music we ask.
I have been thinking about getting an Echo for my family room. I am glad I did. We listen to music, the news, etc. If you have an Amazon Prime account, you will get even more out of it. I love it when my Grandson comes over. I play lullabies to put him to sleep. I can't wait to try some of the other features!
This product was for a 13 year old and it was perfect for his needs at a great price
Well worth the money. Bye-bye cable company bills.
It works well and you can do a lot of things on it.
It was amazing everything was perfect and it came on time
I thoroughly enjoy reading on this. That is the main reason I bought it and it fits nicely in my purse.
Great tool for kids, special when you don't need to $$$ to much.
Very versatile device that is constantly updated by Amazon. Price is very fair for this product.
I was looking for a tablet for my 5 year old. This tablet was definitely worth the price and it's not a "kiddie" tablet, as she calls them.
Great device for reading indoors or outdoors. Very easy to navigate.
Great value tablet, can't beat it for the price. Only issue is it is locked to Amazon.
Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
I had a fire stick and decided to upgrade this so I can connect my internet straight to it and get higher speeds. It runs fast less buggy and I plan on buying another for upstairs bedroom.
Buyer beware They say it's free tv...ITS NOT!You have to pay for everything! I wish I would have bought this before I cancelled my cable.
This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy.
There are many things I love about the Amazon Echo. It reads me the news every morning. News that is tailored to my interests. It will do simple calculations or set reminders and alarms. But most importantly it interfaces with my Smartthings hub and allows me to control all the lights and electrical devices in my house as well as the temperature with my voice.
I purchased this when I cut cable since at the time it was the only device that had a Sony Playstation Vue App. Although Roku added this channel almost immediately after I purchased the Fire TV, the user interface for Vue is better on the Fire TV. Roku has more apps / channels. However, Fire TV is still a decent compliment and the 4K capability makes this a viable option. Speed and performance is good.
Bought to use with harmony hub to control tv and it does! Also very handy for things you used to have to look up on the internet - for example in the morning Alexa what is he weather forecast for today?
Lots of fun to use with other smart home devices.love it
Are use this to automate my home. It connects to my nest thermostat to control the temperature and connect to my Harmony elite to control the TV and lighting.
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FATHER AS HE HAD MY OLD KINDLE EASY FOR HIM TO USE
This is a very servicable tablet ... an excellent value for the price!
I purchased this as a gift for a special needs child, he was able to use mine with ease so I bought his his own. Best Buy carries amazing covers as well and he is now able to listen to music, learn colors and numbers, and access movies in a fun interactive way. This is an amazing purchase for the price.
I love this kindleGreat for adults and kids.Fast processor for price.
My 8 yr old daughter loves her Tap. She uses it for HW and play. Never a dual moment when she is learning something new from her Tap.
I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.
This a great table for my granddaughter. She loves it!
I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
I bought this for my kids and very happy with that.
Wonderful tab. Great for beginners or advanced users. I sugg st a memory chip
Have both the stick and now the Fire Tv. Wish i would have bought this from the get go. Worth the extra money.
This is my first tablet. It is simple to use and very efficient.The only thing that I would have liked would be larger keys on the key pad. Other than that I am very happy with it.
The fire tablet works great, does everything my IPad does but cost way less. Awesome tablet to own especially if you like to read books on them
Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.
Purchased this for my wife for Mother's Day. Wasn't sure what we would do with it but we're finding things. She takes it everywhere with her. Sometimes we put it where we're sleeping and have it play thunderstorm sounds while we're going to sleep.
This is a great product. Great tv and awesome for family content.
What a fun new helper and fun accessory to use around the house. Plays music, plays games with you , orders pizza and much much more....
It worked as it should
This is my second Kindle. The first was a gift several years ago. The display and speed are much better.
Perfect gift for your kid .. will enjoy playing and learning with it
Easy to navigate. Color is good. Duarable. My son has had many fun hours playing with it
The tablet was a gift and we are very happy with the standard options on the tablet. It's easy to use ,has a camera and is a great size .
I wanted a speaker to listen to Pandora and go so much more! Being able to speak to Alexa and get news, weather, timer, light controls and so much more! Love the product!
This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.
Easy way to listen news, weather and traffic in the morning. My husband listen Pandora.
We got one hesitantly and then we signed up for Amazon's unlimited music service. It is great while I am washing dishes I can tell it what I want to listen to and my wife loves it while she cooks. Its nice being able to tell the speaker what you want to hear when you have dirty hands from cooking or cleaning.
This is one kool little tablet. I spent some time with these and really enjoyed what they offered. The y make excellent gifts for little loved ones
This tablet works just as well as the big name one at half the price
I bought this a first tablet. I'm disappointed in the battery life. I sort of expected better especially as I got hooked on online games.
Simple tablet with all the basics. Worth it for the price!
I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase.
I highly recommend the firestick to any user. Great for any age
Love the size, and sharp clear pictures and sounds
Researched this ahead of time and pleased so far. Good processing speed and no issues streaming. Got this specifically to get PlayStation Vue.
Nice size works fine needs to weigh a little less.
we have enjoyed the unit and have used it a lot since we purchased it.
This is my first e reader and I am enjoying it and its great battery life.
I love the paper white because Ican read it if I am out in the sun especially at the beach.
I like to get library books, but just have a super hard time getting them on my Kindle. I finally get it done, but it is such a task because I don't know what to do. Other than that, I really like the Kindle as I can read in bed without turning on the light and I can also read outside in the sun. How great is that!!! I love it. Now, I just need to read how to accomplish the chore at hand---getting library books.
I was hesitant at first about the touch screen, but the Paperwhite has proven the perfect upgrade to my Kindle Keyboard 3G. The screen is responsive and the resolution is crisp. Well done, Amazon.
Love the Echo, only wish the sound quality was a little better for music. As the contact point for your smart devices - 5 stars. As a speaker for music, 3 stars. Good, but not as good as the UE Boom.
I got this for a friend so she could use the internet and have more entertainment. I was happy with the cost.
Alexa is really fun to use and i just bought a smart outlet that she works with. It's great, because you can use her for so many things.
I've had 5 in my household over the years. It's good and does a lot more than be a reader. It's like a tablet...
It's my second Kindle but it didn't come with any instructions so it's taking a little while to figure out. The back lighting is great.
Great does all that I want it too. Will be getting another soon.
I paid $35 for this unit right before Christmas. I have had an iPad mini2 for 3 years and this is not as user friendly, but for $35 now when traveling I have a 2nd streaming device. Perfect for kids/streaming.
Is very good, I like, I recommend this product, I recommend, I recommend
Wasn't sure about getting this or the fire stick, but read this works a lot better. Glad i purchased this.
This is a great little device for a kid or anyone! My daughter loves it! Works simply and keeps her entertained and educated.
I love Alexa, Great way to search. Home screen is organized well lots of options but more with Amazon prime. Spend the money if your prime member.
I like the amazon stream with this tablet. Fast and good quality.
Read the reviews and thought I would give the device a try. Works great. No buffering issues and picture quality is excellent.
It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
I previously purchased this item for my son and daughter as Christmas presents. They both enjoyed it so much and indicated they used it primarily to play music and ask questions. They have also used it to utilize the Alexa skills i.e. playing games, use as a timer etc.. I purchased this item in anticipation of the impending integration with the Sonos speaker system which I have installed throughout the house. I am very excited to learn that the integration is coming soon and will provide another review once I have had an opportunity to operate my Sonos speaker via voice command.
I bought this for my godson and so far he seems to love it. He has downloaded a bunch of games. His mom likes it because it's tied to her account and she was able to set parental controls for specific areas such as movies, etc. I do wish that it came with more than 8 GBs. Just purchased a case and screen protector separately because the kids version is way too much IMO.
Got two of these for my father and mother in laws for Christmas and they absolutely love them. Easy to use and great first tablet.
My mom loved it! User friendly even for the non-techie!
I purchased this as a gift for a family member. She recently used this on a week long vacation and enjoyed the long batter life during the plane trip. The reader was also easy to read in the sun while at the beach.
We're finding it hard to navigate this thing. Others (mostly the young ones) think it's easy.
This is a great tablet for the price. We have 3 of them now one for each family member. Easy to use and does everything that the high priced tablets do.love them never had a bad issue yet
My son loves playing with this tablet. Very easy to keep him entertained
Purchase echo as a gift. Owned mine for over a year and still learning from it..Planning on teaming it up with a couple of dots, great tchnology.
I got this new fire tv with the purpose of canceling my cable company, I save 88$ every month and I'm very happy with it.
I had a kindle before. This time I chose the paperwhite because there has a light and touchscreen. I really love the Kindle products. Very nice buy!
It's very easy to navigate threw! My child loves it!
Bought a few of them on Black Friday for the family. While it's not my iPad it is comparable to any other tablet out there and performs well. The layout is unique which makes it a little difficult to get used to but it's by far worth the money.
It was simply to set up and easy to use. Plug in sign in and bam
I thought this would be a fun toy to have around but it has become much more. I have a home automation system in my home and I continiasly need to find my control panel or bust out my phone, which to be honest is somewhat fustrating.Via Alexa I was able to control everything in my home including my nest which is awesome.Only drawback is price. Its somewhat pricy for what it is.
I love this table for my 4 year old. Ttje parental controls are Awesome! I also like that it changes up the games for her so she won't get board!
Amazon - Echo - Black is a powerful and versatile product. BestBuy had the best price available for this product, at the time of my purchase.
Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle.
Amazon echo is a really cool device to have around the house especially if you have a smart home
I have bought 3. 2 were for gifts and everyone loves the tablet.
Super awesome all in one media device that will surely keep everyone in the family entertained.
I enjoy using the Echo to tell me a joke, stream some music or answer a question. I find it useful for setting timers, alarms or turning on/off lights.
Bought this for my 12yr old son. Can't get him off of it. Gave it 3 stars because it doesn't support google play store and doesn't load most pics on pinterest sometimes. You might need a memory card if you purchase 8gb tablet.
I already have an Echo in the kitchen (which I love) and purchased the Echo dot for the family room to pair it via Bluetooth with a hybrid tube amp, primarily for listening to music through Prime. If you have a home audio set up and prime, and can do with the limitations associated with Prime music, the Echo dot is the way to go. It is fantastic, from an ease of use standpoint (and sound quality from the amp). Setting up multiple Echos is very simple, as is managing them through the Alexa app; and once you teach Alexa a new skill (via additional apps) the skills are applied across all Alexa devices in the home.
This was the best upgrade I've made I love the firestick but the box is much better!!!!!
If you have an amazon prime account this is the item for you!
Can carry a ton a of books around with ease and read any where
A cheap tablet that is a very good bang for your buck.
Slow, advertisements on home screen are annoying can be stopped for a fee
nocomment
I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
I love that this tablet has a variety of apps that can be easily be taken to places
I bought 5 of these for the kids for Christmas Easy to set up Work perfectly
I used this on a daily basis. One of the best gadget so far!
Sure I can use my iPhone for internet browsing and email at home, but for $49 I get 4x the screen area. Silk isn't great, but it works for casual browsing when sitting on the couch in front of the TV.
Good to read on wish it was a larger screen reads just like a book no color just black and white easy to hook up and operate easy the eye
This was really easy to set up and it works perfectly the speaker sounds great for its size I wish it had some bass
This devise is much faster and easy to use. Highly recommended
We bought this as a replacement. My daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before Christmas. We love it! Only issues we have is something she does will make it so only half the apps/games show. However we like she can only play safe age appropriate games and don't have to worry when she's on it.
My granddaughter loves this tablet. She is two and has no problem playing the games and using this tablet. It's very user friendly and keeps her busy for hours.
Love these, great cable cutter. A little glitchy on the remote but really good product
I had a Kindle before and then for reasons unfathomable to me, the Kindle seemed to erase everything when I had unexpected trouble logging in with my password. That was the end of the Kindle. Then I splurged on a Fire and bam, everything came back even better than before.
This is the perfect tablet for my 3 year old son. He loves it and it is easy for him to navigate. It is also easy for me to set up parental controls and give him access to certain apps.
Awesome! Perfect for all readers. The backlight is great for reading in bed.
She's smart, funny, entertaining and very helpful. You should have her in your home. She's so worth it!
Bought them for a 5 yr old and 7 yr old great for easy to use kid apps and learning games
I have yet to figure out what page of the book I am on. Don't really care what percent of a book is left or that I have 5 minutes left in a chapter. After using a Nook for many years this is cumbersome. Good news: way easier to get library books on this.
I've been streaming Wi-Fi for a long time this is my 4th device. It is easily the best so far. It is very easy to use and set up and there is a ton of information you can use on You tube. After several ventures on line and down-loads I'm almost reagy to get rid of cable. In a few months I should have saved enough to go to Best Buy and get a new TV.
This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great!
I picked this one up to replace an older one that had stopped working. I like the back lite and it's not a bad size.
I bought Kindle fire for my grandson who is 24. I have one and he thought great can do so much on it. For the price you can't beat it. I use more then computer.
I had been using a smaller adapter for my Kindle Fire HD for about a year and was told by Amazon I needed this charger. I have had it for a week and I believe they were correct. This new charger is faster and more powerful than any I have had before.This is the latest and newest charger that Amazon sells and has a 9 watt charge.This model is a rounded version of the heavy duty charger. I am very happy with mine.
This box was definitely worth the upgrade than the stick. It's snappier and easy to install programs on.
Great product easy to use and scroll, better than a competitor product we purchased
Bought for my three kids and so far there are no complaints. Easy to use!
Very good produce easy to set up and did not need to read books
This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.
Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on
Amazon echo just keeps getting better and better. It now works with my Lowe's Iris smart home automation. It dims lights, turns off TVs and so much more. It also works with many other home automation devices with means more to expand with.
Bought these for my kids and just love them. The different color choices give it a nice personalized touch.
Got it for $30 on Black Friday great gift they loved it
Finnally decided to read book on eink instead of ipad and got this kindle.I just love it, it is amazing. The text is crispy just like real ink, and the backlight is helful in all lighting conditions. Kindle books are cheaper, so buying this reader actually saves you a lot of money.
Fun new product. Great gift idea especially if you aren't good with technology.
It's fast small cute and great for web. I gave a few as gifts and everyonel over it.
For her for Christmas. I'm no dummy. I did. She loves it!
The Kindle fire was a xmas present for my son in law and he just loves it.
Great product.. lots of fun for the family.I would highly recommend
This was a gift to my niece. Her mom liked the parental controls
I ordered this for a person that has very limited use of his hands and this voice activated device has made a huge difference in his life. Had Geek squad set up with the Harmony Home Companion and now he can adjust and change the TV channels without assistance. Made a huge difference in his life.
Brother in law loves it. He's not very technical so perfect for him.
My kids loves this tablet. They watch YouTube and play games on it all day.
Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
The fire tv outperforms the Apple TV I have already installed on my tv. Great 4K playback and great selection of apps.
I love my Alexa! She plays music when I ask her, she answers questions when I ask, and she turns my lights on and off. 5 stars!!
This has to be one of the best technology purchases I have made. Honestly, I was simply looking for a good quality Bluetooth speaker when I found the Echo.It was around the same price range as the speakers I already had under consideration, but Echo does so much more. I purchased the Lifx lights for my home (wifi connectivity) and control them via Echo. "Alexa turn on the bathroom light" or "Alexa change hall light to blue" I love it. The sound quality for music is fantastic and the Amazon music library is packed full of all of my favorite songs.I also use echo to check the location of my packages, get news and weather updates every morning while I get ready for work and keep an easy to use shopping list. Seriously love this thing.
Having owned a fire stick, this product is much faster!!
As a low priced 8" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.I am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that Amazon pushes onto it.I am also unhappy that I cannot load all the apps I am used to using on my Android phone. Overall, I wish I had spent more for a real Android device rather than having this with the Amazon limited version of Android.
My wife absolutely loves her echo and she would recommend this product to everyone
we use it all the time. it is handy and the kids love to play with it as well. its pretty durable as well. its bounced off the floor a couple times and still works fine
The best tablet for the money. I use it all the time.
I would not know where to start. It is the best among the the field of Android TV. Voice call is second to none. I have recommended it to more than 3 of my frieds.
I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee
I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children. You won't be disappointed!
Not as good as Roku but still a good product. Started using it and kind of liking it. For $70 bucks, I think it is a good price and product
I love my fire.It's a little smaller than I.m used to
I bought this tablet for my 7 year old. Great beginner tablet.
Bought this as a gift for my friends daughter, Works really well, good tablet for about 40 dollars. I did opt for the 2 year protection, Just in case something happens in the 2 years.
Very easy to use. My bf loves it. Good price.recommend it
Great device when working correctly. Every once and a while it gets slow with connectivity and the remote has its days that it doesn't work.
i bought the kindle fire 7 for a media source for my music since it was cheap, the only problem i've found so far is there isn't a good music player to download, if anyone knows of a good one please comment if possible. i also use amazon music app. i wish this had bluetooth capabilities but for $50 it can be forgiven..probably a good tablet for kids, i wish i would've just bought a samsung, asus, or lenovo tablet instead but really this is pretty good
Nice ereader for reading books. Browser should be improved otherwise fine for reading books, another irritating part is ads pop up which amazon shud fix
Excellent value priced 10" tablet. To bad Amazon killed it. I purchased it as a gift for my wife and she loves the size and quality of the display.
Perfect for surfing web. Love the size, not too big, not too small.
Works but has a tendency to freeze or get slow. Probably wouldn't purchase again
The Amazon Echo is great. It was easy to set up. Alexis tells me the weather, plays anything I ask her and adjusts the volume at my request! Amazing.
The device has provided our family with numerous hours of TV watching without the high monthly costs of cable
I've had my Echo now for a month. It was easy to set up, it interprets both my commands and my wife's commands very well and we continue to find helpful ways to use it day-to-day.
My old Kindle was 4 years old, this one is so much easier to use. I like the new features. I definitely will recommend it to my friends and family.
I had an I pad and replaced it with a MACAIR. However it is heavy and when i travel, I don;t feel like logging it along! So for $49, I thought "HOW CAN I LOSE"? SO I bought it and I love it! The only thing I dislike are the ads that keep popping up for me to buy stuff. I am not sure it can be turned off. Other than that- NO COMPLAINTS!
Great tablet... Easy to operate and very durable..
My daughter loves it. Was a little hesitant because of it being Amazon ad machine, but it turned out to be a great purchase
My daughter loves it. She has an IT background and loves any technology that is new .
This is the best thing I ever bought. Very lightweight and user friendly. Fits easily in my purse.
Really enjoy the variety of music and getting answers to all types of questions. A fun device!
great product--exceeded expectations. Love the paper white screen
Alexa is very good a quickly satisfying your music requests. The whole interface is novel and interesting to use and for guests who have not encountered Alexa previously. Sound quality is good but not top shelf. I purchased one for our son and son-in-law for Fathers Day. Finally about 3 weeks ago we bought one for ourselves. Net: worth purchasing.
This was bought for my nephew for his birthday and he absolutely loves it..
I never thought I would buy a Kindle fire but I had purchased prime and discovered to be part of their lending library you have to use an Amazon product. Well, lucky for me Amazon had just released this 7" Fire. I purchased it thinking the worst that could happen is I would be out $50.00. Well to my surprise the little tablet works very well. It is a perfect complement to the prime service and I have been very, very pleased. It is not a Samsung or an Ipad by no means but for what it can do it does it very well. I guess the best part to me like I said is it compliments the prime service beautifully. The O.S. system is almost flawless for watching Videos or reading books or the internet. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is not as good as the others overall but for $50.00 it is well worth it.
Works great even downstairs from my nighthawk router, responds much quicker than fire stick and works great with ps Vue. For sure get this over the stick.
Like this so much bought another one for my daughter.
I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and she loved it.
I bought three of these tablets for my three boys (ages 9 - 13). The tablets were easy to setup and the boys love them. They seem to be very durable.I like the fact that I can connect them to my Amazon account and they have a lot of detailed parental controls available. I can, for example, limit time on games and movies separately from books so they spend their screen time actually getting some reading done. I can also limit total daily screen time so there is no struggle when it's time for them to get off the tablets.I'm very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend the Amazon Fire tablet.
Got one for myself and one for my son. Like the parental settings available. No more inappropriate youtube videos. Fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night.
Fantastic sound from such a small speaker, excellent! Not as impressed with its other potential capabilities- more difficult to set those up & get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather, order items, etc.. Wish it came with more pre installed I guess.
The Amazon - Fire TV with (2015 Model) work great, easy setup
Just excellent product.great sound.great features.answers most questions.
I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!
Bought for son- great tablet for a great price!! Would buy again :)
Amazon Echo is the best thing you do not know you need. It is nice to have Prime along with it. The speaker fills the house with nice sets on request. Go get one. And you will soon find you want one in other rooms. Dots do nice here.
Nice interface, easy to use, voice search is fantastic!
I purchased this since I bought my grandson this tablet for Christmas. The tablet is slow, considering price that's OK.I have problems with the charger, it won't charge when I am using the tablet, the charger needs to be plugged in and not moved for it to charge.For the price the tablet is OK.
Have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of uses and I greatly prefer it.
I would recommend Amazon Alexa. Been just using her to answer weather and general questions. Have a lot more to learn and try. Get new ideas everyday.
My daughter loves this; she is reading voraciously
A nice complement to the Alexa family. The sound quality is nearly as good as the original Echo, and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by, particularly for the price.
One of the important reasons I purchased this was for HBO Go app which they have but does not work with Charter-Comcast. A quite large market of People affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it. What else can you not use it for I haven't found yet but Amazon has not written me back after I emailed them about this issue. Im stuck with waste of Money and will go get a Google Chrome now.
I now have access to many free movies and TV shows with the provided apps and have additional viewing choices with subscriptions to Netflix and MLBTV. It has turned my regular TV into a smart set.
I started with the original kindle- loved it but light was bright on the cover for night reading. Then got the fire as a gift and love that but reads more like on a tablet.. Broke down and bought the latest paperweight to read at night- great light to dim for night reading. Very light too!
Works well. Nice to know I have additional chargers that are the same size. I'm really glad I bought the paperwhite kindle.
Have been using a tablet and find the Kindle harder to navigate.
Bought these for my kids for the holidays. No you tube app installed, so you have to find a 3rd party substitute. Ads pop up all the time, with an option to remove them for $15. Amazon states that since I purchased the tablet on sale for $15, this is how they can afford to compensate for that revenue. I would have returned them had we been able to find the receipt.Maybe a good product, but not for us.
My wife and I like to go to the beach, and lay out by the pool during the spring and summer months. She reads it in direct sunlight with no glare! She also likes to read it at night before we get to sleep. She loves it and calls it her little piece of technology heaven. The Kindle paperwhite is small, lightweight, and lights up at night allowing reading without harsh light filling the room. Water resistance and long battery life are a plus as well. Two thumbs up!
I have this tablet and loved it so much I gave one as a gift. Battery life is long.
Fabulous little tablet for the money. Light and zippy. A few limitations on available apps and external hardware but if you just want something to access email, read a book or stream video this is the way to go.I needed this as an early December birthday present for an older lady whose old tablet had quit working. She loves it.Also Best Buy came through when Amazon was already out of their own product before it was even December.
Awesome product worth it would recommend it Anybody
i adore my echo...i wake up in morning, get a quick weather, sports scores...and here in florida, i get to listen to my favorite nyc sports radio stations...i use it to access my music...and i recently purchased a audio book for the wife, and i am waiting until i give her that audiobook for xmas; the i can ask alexa to read it to me ! ... i am sure alexa does so much more...(i even asked it to convert to metric for me when i was cooking last week)...i do not have any smart devices in my house, so i havent had the opportunity to have alexa do that for me...but it is so much fun to use...and now, instead if reaching for laptop to google something...i just ask alexa first
I love the new kindle. It has many updates that make it more like a tablet. Great gaming options and is still the perfect device to read books from.
Got this for Christmas for my 3 year old and she loves it!
love it, great hd, smooth streaming with sd card--I've bought 3 as gifts and one for myself I like them so much
This was a gift for my friend and he absolutely Love it. He tells me all the time how his kids always wants to use it.
Easy to carry in purse or pocket but doesn't do anything better than the cheapest Kindle reader.
I love the how clear and fast streaming . Would highly recommend this item for steaming etc
Cheap functional tablet, slower than most if not all latest smartphones.
Bought this for my kid, easy to use. Set up parental controls so they don't shop on Amazon, and it's quick.
Got two of these for the grandkids, they just love them. We also have a Kindle Fire. We use these for reading, playing games, etc.
Loved this as a Xmas gift !! Recommend to all!!!!!
Perfect for watching Netflix, surfing web, checking email, and reading kindle books.
This replaced my 5 year old keyboard unit which died after hitting the floor. I expect this will be every bit as good. Kindle is my favorite reader.
I really use it a lot. I take it with me everywhere. It fits perfectly in my purse. Love it for games and email.
Bought for kids and really they enjoying. Size is small but compact for kids
Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine
Works great. Fast uploading and doesn't take up any space.
This tablet is perfect for my lil brother. He love it
Perfect size for me. Speaker clarity is amazing and produces a great picture
Kindle makes reading easy, lightweight and the light makes reading much easier in low or no light.
the size is perfect ....the battery excellent ....got it on a sale .....love it
Great tablet for price. Display is clear. Enjoy books on tablet.
I know a lot of the ability of the Amazon Echo is more than I know...if there was a real tutorial available, this would probably be a great product.
I had the paperwhite, but this voyage is definitely better. The quality is better, screen is seamless with the edge, which makes it feel premium and delivers more comfortable reading experience. Lighter than the paperwhite, love the pressure sensors to change pages. Overall better experience reading experience than the paperwhite.
This multifunctional device is amazing. After downloading the apps, your possibilities are endless.
Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit.
Worked right out of the box, and connected to internet very quickly. I must say that I have fallen in love with Alexa; she does many things for me:Sets timersSets alarms, and manages my calender Does routine math And many other things that I have not even discovered yet.
I got it because it is very helpful. Just by calling her name and on top of that ANYTHING you ask her she has the answer. It's like always having someone to talk to. I love my Amazon Echo!
Bought for my son liked the price. He likes it but had some trouble with screen brightness and resetting it.
Excellent price. Functions well. Added memory card for additional storage. Wonderful purchase for use as both reader and tablet!
Solid tablet if you want to read and do basic internet
I'm not sure this device would have gotten much use if I didn't have any home automation devices. It is very continent to ask Alexa to turn off certain lights, set my thermostat to a certain temp and trigger events through IFTTT. I really don't use any of the other features like creating lists or scheduling events, but I do use the timer function while I am in the kitchen.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 -Other devices cannot utilize my Echo's speaker, I would like for SmartThings to be able to integrate with my echo to announce when someone walks through a main entry door, or if my garage door opens, which I know other Wi-Fi connected speakers are capable of doing.Echo to Echo connectivity would also be a nice feature, being able to say "Play music in all rooms" or while standing in the kitchen "Play music in the living room"
Although not the greatest tablets on the market when compared to Apple or Samsung products but when you weight in the price it is worth the purchase!
This Kindle7" reader is light weight for carrying around.
The whole family loves it.................... .. .
I purchased this table for my 75 year old mom and she was able to navigate with little assistance.
Love this speaker it sounds great and love controlling it without having to touch it
My granddaughter is enjoying it thoroughly. My son likes the various parental controls
This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me
Wife and kids love this product. I think it has become our personal weathergirl.
This tablet is great for beginners like myself, I haven't done much more than check emails and read articles but there is more to learn and do
Awesome steaming device, compared to the Roku 3 I would give the Amazon Fire TV the edge. Great buy, I would recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about cutting the cord on their cable subscription.
