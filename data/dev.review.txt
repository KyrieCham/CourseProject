Love alexa. She does some much. Great sound level for music
I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it.
My children love their tablets plus they were more affordable than kid tablets. I just purchased a child proof case and downloaded the games they play. Totally worth it!
Good starter tech equipment for the 8 year old..I am happy with the purchase
Very slow to connect to internet even with a good connection and wifi set up that worked for other electronics.
I bought it for granddaughter so she would leave my tab alone and it worked my tab is mine again
Battery life is awesome. Works great with the lights off and goes to sleep after a few minutes of non use
I love the picture quality from this device. Can't go wrong with a 4k . Also the picture steaming on the TV screen amazing. Good job amazon.
Good tablet for Facebook and games. Clean quick and she says it ok..ehhh
My daughter has enjoyed it very much!!!! She loves using the camera. And playing the games she just loves it. We have to put it on charge and she is asking 5 minutes later is it charged yet!!!! Really is kid friendly
Bout this for my step-son. Easy to use and durable.
The only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the inability to download directly from the Google play store. Otherwise good image and quick response.
I am very happy with my e-reader. It is so practical for reading along with my daughter. she has one as well, and we use them to read every night as required by her 4th grade class curriculum.
It's a great product I suggest that other people buy it
This is a great tablet for the money. Able to do everything a higher priced tablet does
This is a good product the resolution is clear and very pretty. Glad I bought it.
I bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speakers at my friends house. I also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree. The sound quality is good. The noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume. Only downside is no battery operation (it must always be plugged in). Also, even though it has bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone, you cannot use the echo to pass through phone calls (Only music). For IOT toys its fun for voice control (ex: nest, etc). The skills are mostly cheesy though. Fun toy that allows easy access to prime music, pandora, etc.
I bought this for my boy, he is too happy to play games and no issues so far.
Alexa is amazing it absolutely just works for anything that I ask easy to set up she's so easy to talk to I haven't had any complications at all I would definitely recommend this to family and friends it's absolutely perfect it was a Christmas gift and I love it
My Alexa is so awesome. While cleaning the house it's so easy just to say Alexa play Without having to stop and search for the song in your playlist or choose and pick which songs you want. My housework can get done so much quicker now and is much more enjoyable.
Decent product. Not so much if you're used to android software. You can't get your photos saved in google. More than half of my music collection vanished once the memory card was inserted. Basicly have to hack the thing to get any apps outside of amazon and then reliability is poor. Exchanged it for am android tablet
I bought this for my mom she is an avid reader she has nothing but the best comments about this paper white kindle so im gonna have to say this product is amazing for your self or as a gift for some 1 that reads alot.
This was purchased for my grandson for Christmas, he is so in love with it, Great price and quality. Will probably get another grandchild one.
Good overall android box quick and easy to operate
Full of knowledge and easy to hook up. Would reccomend
Love it, great buy, use it all the time. Yes I would buy it again
This Amazon Tablet is, for the money, the best one on the market today. I purchased them for Christmas gifts this year (2016) and when I saw them, Grabbed 2 out of the 5 that were on display. I did so, because last year when I tried to get one, Everybody was sold out !!! Not 1 to be had !!
I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I must say it is fast and comes with Amazon underground apps which are all free. Great value!
This tablet is easy to use had a lot of great features.
This is a decent eBook if you are only interested in Book Reading. not a colored screen but so do not compare it with any iPAd / Pad ... good for reading. Good gift for Senior citizens.
Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.
I have owned several e-readers. This is the best one I have ever had! You won't regret when you get it.
Superb value for the price I paid. I can stream video easily, and read ebooks with ease.
This thing is great it not only plays music but you can tell her what grocerys you need & she will add them to a list & email them to you in real time.
I use this to access playstation vue, Netflix, Hulu, youtube, kodi and Amazon prime. This works great as a replacement for directv and it paid for itself the first month.
My kids love this and I love the fact that it is under $100 with warranty for 2 years added on. Best Buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. I also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away.
I bought this for my daughter. It was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. She insisted on using her brother's iPad constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her.
Great speaker and Alexa is so awesome. Great price
The two main purposes I use the Echo for are the flash news briefing and as a bluetooth speaker. Alexa isn't any more intuitive than Siri, or Google Assistant.
I bought this for my grandson for his 5 Th birthday present . It is easy to set up and seems to be very durable.
My son thoroughly enjoys having this tablet, and I love the protective case that comes with it.
I really like the tablets. My grand kids enjoy them a lot.
2nd one I've bought as a gift, can't go wrong! Will probably end up buying another!
this is a very good product and is the better in the market thanks
This is a good tablet. Kids are happy and so am I. Got my stuff back now that kids have their own.
Easy set up but did not meet my needs of being able to access Spectrum app. .
I love how clear and bright the display is. Also love how light it is.
Great reader, bought it for my wife at a great price.
I own this tablet and bought a second one for a gift. There are so many great features on it -has lots of totally free game apps and is a great companion to Amazon Prime service.
This is an awesome kindle easy to transport and love the clear screen.
Perfect for price and purpose. I bought this for my 19 month old granddaughter to watch videos and listen to songs on instead of using parents iPhone. When she is older she will be able to play games. Perfect size for her to hold. Love guarantee
Sure you can get this app on all devices but try reading those screens in the sun. This reader does the trick
This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew
On the way away from cable ! Cable has increased in price for not any thing new .
This tablet is great because you don't need a data plan but you can do anything that any other tablet can do maybe even a bit more. The only restriction is you need Wi-Fi to run it but let's face it Wi-Fi is everywhere now.
I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.
I love the light built into this Kindle. I have had the basic Kindle for years but it's difficult to read in a room that is not well lit. Love the new and improved Kindle!
awesome buy for the price. camera rated 5 out of 10
The paperwhite is so cool. I don't know why I didn't get it sooner.
I have been wanting a tablet for awhile and I finally decided to get the Amazon Fire tablet, I love it I can look at Pinterest and check email I love it!!
I've been a long time user of their main competitor's products and recently purchased this to get a few e-books not available in the other vendor's catalog. The biggest difference I noticed is that this ereader defaults to having the light on at all times. I was skeptical at first, but haven't seen any problems with battery life and it actually is a little nicer to read, even in moderately lit areas.
I gave this Tablet to my nephew and he can't put it down. It is very Durable. Great Product!
Great product for the price. I got it for my kids during thanksgiving and they love it
Great for home use and makes a great housewarming gift!
My daughter loved it nd I love that she leaves my phone alone now.
I love this product. I have it on the kitchen counter and use it to save to my grocery list. Then when I go to the store, I just pull the shopping list on the phone app. Other features - I use it to leave messages to other members of the family, help me convert cooking measurements when increasing the number of servings for a recipe, etc. Each day I discover a new feature I can use.
Handles good, just the right size, appearance is great
Internet sucks on this thing. They need to do something better. My phone is 3x faster.
I used to own another kindle and I used a case with a little led light for reading before bed. Not a problem with this one!! I love that feature that I think I'm even reading more now than ever before!
This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.
Very good item for a very reasonable price. Easy to work, gets the job done.
We only used this camera for a couple weeks but it does its job. Is not slow or anything.. If you need it for reading or watching videos, or only for one thing at time is great.
This product does what it say it do. I really enjoy reading
The ads aren't as annoying as you think they would be. Pretty lightweight and good battery life. Good for casual use.
I could not be happier with the functionality of Alexa. She also has a great sense of humor.
This is the best streaming device I have purchased yet. Hooks to Ethernet and is lightning fast!
Bought this for my mother. She thought it would be good for calendar and reminders. After setting up and installing a few extra apps, she seems to enjoy it, but mostly using it for music, weather, etc.
Great product a like a lot .works perfect in any tv
Great product for any office or home a little pricey most of what it does do can be done from a smart phone
I would like to say that they are really tuff the hold up to my kids lol
Absolutely love it! Love the app store and the camera.
Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can't beat this product!
Got this for my wife and I think she was able to use it maybe a week before our kid stole it. He loves the thing.
Love everything about my Kindle. I'm a long-term Amazon Prime member.
Works as intended. Great inexpensive reader very convenient for reading at home or traveling when don't have the extra space for books. The kids & I both use it and I can separate our books so they're not mixed together.The only downside is the lack of color, but I knew this going in - it's not the fault of the product.We lose out a little bit by not being able to see the color illustrations and book covers. When getting my kids to read, the colorful covers is often what draws them in.
Good FireTV but remote is buggy. Other than that its a FireTV.
Purchased this on Black Friday as a gift for my 9 year old. Set up was super easy. I like how I can create multiple profiles on the device so that my son only has access to what I want him to have access to.
I'll never go back to books - Very easy to use and comfortable on the eyes
I've was married to the same man for 30 something yrs and they was the best time in my life we have kids that's all grown and they have kids now. I love them deeply but they all are upset with me because they haven't had a Christmas ,I always get my Grand kids something but it hasn't happen in 3 yrs. I can't seem to be able to afford it any more I thought the kids would love the tablet I know they will because they all stay on computer like me it's educational for them and my self. I'm disable and have nothing to do so
Led to more echo dots and significant home automation.
The fire tv has been a cool utility to add to the entertainment department in our household. Much more responsive than the stick... hardly any lag. Continuous updates from Amazon keeps the UI fresh & ever evolving content is a plus.
FireTv is great. Easily installed and user friendly.
Love this Kindle. You can adjust the font.It reads well outside no problems with sunlight. Best purchase.
It sets on the kitchen counter and is used for everything!! Music, weather, any question you ask it, it will answer!!
The kindle fire has all the things you need to read books, surf the net and play!
This is indeed a great product. Touch sensitivity and overall performance offcourse cannot beat other top brands, but it is with a very good price.
Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen.
I loved me previous Kindle but always had to keep light on to read in the dark. The backlight on this makes it so much easier to read in the dark, it's not too bright and battery goes for about two weeks. The resolution is higher too, font looks crisp and sharp.
I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it
I purchased this for my son and its the best thing I bought.
works great in bright sun also. downloads fast and is compact so I can take it anywhere.
a good device, better voice assistant apps and commands
Super easy to setup for the kids to use. Parental controls are a bonus.
I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
I just wish it had an optical audio out like the previous model so that's why it loses a star but in general, it's a cool device to stream movies etc.
I do love the Echo. I loved it so much, I bought 2 plus a tap. The only / biggest problems are that some times she doesn't hear / understand me. Also, she doesn't have a Bluetooth connection to my stereo. Otherwise, we use it all of the time.
Great tablet for the grandsons. They love it and it fits all their needs for Facebook, Email, and reading
After my grand kids fighting over my wife's Kindle in the car, we decided to get them each one for trips. Good first tablet
Other than the fact that the set up for an iPhone was extremely exhausting and frustrating, the device itself works great and is a lot of fun and helpful .
great price and a better gift,i was looking nice gift.
Helps grand daughter with proper pronounciation of lots of words and names.
Extremely easy to use and to purchase. The touch screen works well and the auto on-off is very helpful. Love the ability to just close and system is off and not using battery.
Purchased this tablet to use as a control panel for Action Tiles.It is a decent tablet for its really low price. Side loaded Google Play store and utilizing Kiosk Browser, I have Action Tiles displaying my Home status as to security, controls and Sonos speakers.Would recommend this tablet for this use and anyone wanting a bare bones tablet.
Its a good product in the basic range. Not that fast to work on.
Very nice tablet. Durable if dropped. My grand daughter loves it.
Love it. Exactly what I needed for home automation.
For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
This is a great streamer at a great price. I really enjoy using it.
I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed.
It isn't my first e-reader Amazon - Kindle, and last model - Amazon - Kindle Paperwhite is very-very good!
This sub charger gives a quicker charge for our kindles than the other Amazon and apple chargers that we have.
Bought the Fire TV because the remote could be used to control Slingbox, plus being an Amazon Prime member had access to a lot of content. Works great
bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!!
Amazon Fire TV is really easy to setup. It also has given me an easy way to stream 4K media for any service, Amazon, Netflix, etc. The quality of the picture and sound is really good. The menu is easy to follow, and it is so much more advanced than the Apple TV. I especially like the App you can use to control The Fire TV from my I-phone or I- Pad.
Got for my wife's xmas. She loves it and uses it more than she thought she would. Small screen but good for kindle reading. Maybe worth the $15 for no ads, annoying
I bought this for my 8year old. Perfect for her to browse the internet and access games, books, and other basic things. Parental controls included
Great product easy to use. Having different color choices wonderful.
Great product very easy to use. Very good for programs such as Lodi.
Works Great , Great Item , Easy to Use & Easy to Download
A waste of money. You don't need this. Just plug your tablet into your computer and the charge lasts for a month.
I can read it on the beach with bright Sun lite I love it
Cheap tablet, bought as a secret santa gift exchange item. My cousin opened it on Christmas and absoluitely loved it. Simple and easy to use, not as fast as an Ipad, but still serves in purpose for simple web browsing.
I was hesitant to buy a Kindle Paperwhite as I already owned an entry level Kobo that was about 6 years old. However, I'm goad that I upgraded as this device is smaller, lighter, and more ergonomic. Its a lot easier to hold for an extended period of time. Additionally, as part of the Kindle ecosystem, borrowing e-books from the library is a snap and no longer requires me to hook up to my computer.
Alexa is really great, I use her everyday requesting musics with my son. I also use integrating with my philips hue.
love the products I bought for xmas presents they liked them alot
My previous experience with Amazon stick was awful but after returning that I tried this product and was way better.
Good for kids And adults. I would recommend this tablet to anyone.
Love the setup of this fine streaming tool!!! Use it daily
I got this as part of the Black Friday deals and my wife really loves it for reading books on. The battery lasts several days with moderate use.
Great addition to our home. It's like having your very own virtual assistant.
I would say Its a great Product Especially if You have high tech Gear all around your home to connect to Besides As a Speaker it has Pretty good Bass sounds Great!
I purchased one a few weeks before purchasing this one. SD Card slot cover broke when trying to insert card. Decided to get another one. This one is fine. Have to use tape to hold other one in.
The Amazon Fire TV is an excellent product. It has so many capabilities that I can never use them all. Connects both wired and wi-fi. I have Amazon Prime and get more free stuff that really expands the experience.If you have kids they can take the use to a whole new level.
I actually bought this for a friend. I already have one. She loves to read and I thought this would be perfect for her to download books on. She absolutely loves it for that plus all the other features she can do on her tablet. Such a great buy!
If you want a tablet but on a budget, go for this.
I love this kindle and its screen which is good for low light reading and also in sunlight.
The Echo is incredible. It gives you instant responses to questions thatYou ask. It is easy to pair with your phone and Internet. It has many unique features such as pairing with your lights and thermostat in your house if you purchase those specific pairing devices.
I like it for the price but did notice some flaws.
Very capable wireless bluetooth speaker, but the real genius is the awe inspiring voice recognition. It blows away Siri and other voice assistants. There is something really magical about using your voice as a computer interface. Constant over the air updates mean that this device gains new functionality every week.
Bought this to replace my old kindl its a bit smaller also easyer to handle
My late stepmother had a Kindle Fire that she used to read her electronic novels and my wife loved how much easier they were to read than on the iPads. Lots of great reviews of the Kindle Paperwhite so this will be a great Christmas gift this year!
Easy set up and use. Beautiful screen, comfortable and light weight. No eye strain!
Purchased 2nd one as a gift. Use it everyday. Highly recommended
I'm really enjoying my Echo. There are so many things it can do. You can create a shopping list, ask for the weather, play music, just to name a few. The sound quality is pretty good also.
Great product. Very light and fast compared to its predecessor.
It would be beneficial to have amazon prime to give even more options. Very easy to use and set up was simple. The ability to add other Wifi devices is a great option. We use it to turn lights on, adjust our thermostat, play music, answer questions and so much more.
I have tried the Roku and Vizio streaming boxes, and Fire TV blows them away. I have also tried several streaming sticks. The Fire TV box is more responsive, has a higher quality remote, and Alexa adds fantastic value with speech commands that are fantastically integrated. For those wanting to utilize 4k streaming this is a great start with small investment.
Grandson loves this tablet, does everything he needs
This is the best by far I brought a different kind and had a lot of problems purchased the amazon stick and had no problem streaming movies,shows or playing games
It's get for my 6 and 4 year old boys, and they love them
These are made for the Echo and as I use my Echo in a couple ends of the house so it is convenient to have the two of them
Bought this tablet for price and for a little kid using it so I wasn't expecting it to be a flag ship device but this really isn't the best. The amazon version of android really ruins things.. you can't get the same apps that you would get from the Android Play Store. Many apps on this Amazon app store are just not the same and the apps you do get are mainly made by others- for ex- Youtube, someone basically made the website into an "app" but its $50 so its whatever
My daughters first tab,I love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his
This is a great product that is also a lot of fun.
I like it my son can watch his 2 favorite shows with out any problems
I purchased this tablet for my grandfather to use. He likes to play casino games and read! This works great for it. He is even learning to use the camera!
I bought the fire TV to use with Playstation Vue It is more responsive for Vue than the app on PS4
i saw this and wanted it right away. it works good and helps me.it also keeps me company. i would recomend it to anyone out there.
Got it during black Friday weekend at a great price, works good no problems with them.
I love it. Especially for the price................
nice tablet for the price able to browse internet with ease
I'm enjoying my new kindle paperwhite so far. Everything is perfect.
I purchased one for each of my kids (4) and they love them and now I don't have to fight for my phone because they are on it playing app games lol!!!
Love it, had Roku 2,3 and this replaced all of them. Would high recommend this over Fire Stick, faster and can add extra memory...Cut cable and use this as our primary tv source along with antenna for local channels kid love as well very easy to use...
got five of these at black friday, great price and deal, worth the money
Highly recommend. Battery is perfect. Light weight too!
i like this because i have one to and i love it.and i will never ever get rid of it i been wanting one and now i have one and my mom has one and her man has one and we all like them and they are easy to use.
Replaces the original with no problems whatsoever.
Tablet was working perfectly. Now the charging port isn't working. Can't charge the tablet. Will be sending back.
This review comes with a caveat. Many tech sites say e-readers are dying, kind of like the "Nintendo is doooooomed" crowd, or the GPS is obsolete argument. I don't disagree. As our phones become more sophisticated and the phone screen sizes continue to balloon up to tablet-like proportions, dedicated devices will continue to go the way of the dodo. But sometimes, if you're interested enough, a dedicated device is precisely what you need. I had (key word: "had") an ipad mini 2 that I had been using as my all-round in-bed Netflix + reading machine. Except I'd get about 3 seconds in before getting nudged by my wife due to half the room being lit up. As I spend more time reading on my ipad than watching Netflix, I decided to sell my ipad mini and just buy 2 kindles - one for my wife and myself. The new Kindle Paperwhite feels just as solid as the outgoing model, but the resolution is now 300 dpi. The e-ink screen almost feels like a page of a paperback when you swipe, and in my personal preference, I like that.The battery is rated to last 6-8 weeks on average between the various tech sites, which trumps my ipad mini by several life cycles. Yes the screen has to refresh unlike a tablet, but it's not very noticeable and I don't find it distracting at all for reading.Cases aren't nearly as ubiquitous as for the ipad, so you've basically got the standard Amazon-branded leather case or offbrand cases from sites like Ebay.I enjoy reading, and I frankly don't want to wear any thicker glasses than I already have. Backlight can cause bad eye strain, so that's another plus for the Kindle over the iPad.In summary, TL;DR: if you want a dedicated e-reader, you can't go wrong with the Kindle PW. The price:performance ratio is much better than the Voyage IMHO.But that's assuming that you're somebody who spends enough time reading to make the Kindle device worth carrying. If you only read for a few seconds here and there, adding an extra device to lug around isn't for you. So like a Garmin, the market has a specific niche and YMMV depending on your needs. For me, the Kindle was a great fit.
I love my amazon fire tv. I canceled my directv and replaced it with the fire tv. I saved $165.00/ month.
Love the Kindles. I give them for gifts. Love access to free books
First let me say we love out echos. As a family this is our " dance party" speaker. DJ (Alexa) takes requests. With more and more updates to this product it has great potential.My only wish is that it were more intuitive for non high tech. Over time I guess. We love. Bought 2.
good tablet for a young person to begin with small to handle
I love being able to add items to my grocery list or listen to a particular song whenever I want.
I use this tablet to read e-booksome and watch movies. The screen quality is great. The tablet is small enough to fit in my purse.
Great product. I have two of these and a couple of the POD's. These are great for listening to music, solid built in speaker and the POD with Bose bluetooth speakers is only a slight improvement. I'm already buying two more of these for Christmas gifts
I have purchased this item for 3 grandkids to date. Exactly does what it needs to do.
Like all amazon stuff i have used these things are great built insanly well and eith a reasonable price tag way better then any of the rokus i have tried.
Good tech product but needs more basic information. Constantly states that not able to answer my questions at this time. Might need more information on how to program for more content information.
I loved the kindle fire so much that I purchased a second one for my husband.
The Kindle Fire HD 8 is great for users of all types!
Perfect for reading in sunny conditions, eliminates the storage need for books in the house
Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it.
Love the device, especially to read in the dark without disturbing my wife with the lights.
I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button.
Got these as Christmas presents for some of my family members and I must say they love it.
I purchased this tablet for my grandson who is 4 years old. He loves it!
Great for my daughter and my mom they love it!!!!!
I am pleasantly surprised with Amazon's new 5th Generation Kindle Fire.As a purchaser of a 1st Generation Kindle Fire, I welcomed the addition of a dual camera option plus the expansion of a microSD slot. This version of the Fire is lighter in the hand and seems to hold up well to my handling of the device.The new OS seems to work well in spite of the "commercial" aspect. After finding the appropriate setting to turn off the promotional ads, my Fire became more enjoyable. This feature was not a surprise but what I would expect in a device from Amazon and its ecosystem.The Kindle Fire is an excellent 7-inch tablet for its $50 price and the perfect entry in the arena of small tablets for the newby.
This device has changed our home automation system to make it usable. It integrates with so much and does about anything you can think of. I am excited to just see how far they take it.
Really super nice way to watch TV...I am a Amazon Prime member so I don't know how great it would be without Prime but with it it's the best way to watch TV...PERIOD!
Best Black Friday deal. They were available and I got two!
I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
I previously had a Roku however decided to purchase the Fire TV Box instead. It definitely meets all my needs and has been a real pleasure to use.
We are a Kindle family! Use them all the time! Reading books, checking email, watching Netflix. Would be very sad without it!!!
Concerns about syncing our phones to Echo and difficulty loading music was a deal breaker. Maybe its operator error. Not for us.
Have bought 5 of these. Good wifi and has an Ethernet port much faster than fire stick
This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app
Bought this nice kindle fire kids tablet for my 18 month son for a 6 hour road trip to LA and it did the job. I downloaded some movies and apps from Amazon to keep the little guy busy. He absolutely loved it and best thing is the case it's very durable. Plus with 2 year guarantee if anything happens they'll replace it for free. We both love it!
I was looking for a reader that was just a reader. I did not want a tablet. The Paperwhite is the perfect choice for me. It is very easy to use and has a clear reading surface. It is a great size and I can read outside, inside and in the dark. I read the reviews and then went to Best Buy to see it. It was everything the reviews said. Some said there is a gray area at the bottom of the screen but I did not find that. I highly recommend it.
Does what is says and more. Although initially somewhat complicated to get things going.
My Grandaughter loves it! Found it easy to understand and can read anywhere she likes.Great product!
This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.
Got this for my fiancé and she loves how easy it is to use, and how light the product is. Would highly recommend to all book readers.
I couldn't decide on which one to buy. They all do the same things, but ended up buying the tap which is portable. I take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music I put in through pandora and iheart radio. I absolutely love it, and so does my husband.
An improvement upon the earlier versions, plus the newer, enhanced text. Makes for a great reading experience!
This is a great movie box. Subscribe to Amazon and you'll have access to tons of content. Games are cool addition also.
Lightweight, small size that travels easily. Great for reading. Email capable but rather clumsy. I bought because of the long battery life and not to drain phone & iPad as I travel. Great for this purpose!
Can't be beatPrice and product great valueHighly recommend
Even though you need to have a Amazon prime membership to fully exploit the tab , it comes at a very very cheap price.
Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet!
I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book
Perfect size for doing everything!Multiple accountss- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids a.Battery llife is amazing Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great
Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload.
Nice basic reader. Had the first model kindle and this is quite a bit lighter
great size and shape clear screen easy to use has a lot of options
I have owned several Kindles and Kindle Fires, and I have been happy with all of them. If you already are an Amazon Prime member, you can't go wrong with one of these tablets.
Purchased this to test it out. I have a prime membership. The interface seems a little slow and not as intuitive as other streaming players however do like the 4K capability for the price
I love the new Amazon Fire TV. I have signed up my accounts to it and it makes watching movies and tv shows a lot easier. Instead of paying for cable and never watching half the channels, you can choose what apps are best for you and save money!!the only con i have is that its not as smooth as the apple tv but it does offer more apps
I like this one because it is easy to operator and the battery last a long time.
It's fast reliable and easy for any age to play games read or browse
I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it! The paperwhite version makes the screen look like you are reading an actual book. Also,there are a lot of ebook deals daily and she definitely loves that aspect of having a kindle too.
I bought two of these items. The first was for my mother in law. She is visually challenged and it was recommended by her doctor. The second I received as a fathers day gift. The first one had issues that required a return and replacement. It now works fine. Exchanged at Best Buy with no problem. The only problem I see is the limitation on available apps. But that is a minor issue at this point. For the money you can't beat it.
I have loved my echo this far. Alexa has so many skills that are super helpful. I do love the mute option too because sometimes shes picks up when Alexa commercials come on so I can just mute her.
It's a good tablet for a young kid. A little hard to navigate even for adults. Cant figure out how to navigate the internet!
This device has been amusing and entertaining and it works well
Brought it for my husband and he absolutely loves it
We needed to upgrade to 4K and this made it available.
The Amazon Echo provides great sound quality with no fuss. Just say "Alexa play me some music" and voila!!!Set up is easy.
I did not know what to expect when I bought this, but after getting it home and experimenting, it was very helpful and my eight year old loves it. There are so many things Alexa can do, only limited by your imagination. We love it!
Echo or Alexa from Amazon is smart and learns along with you. She is a nice gift for teens as well as seniors. It's the kind of thing you might think you didn't want or need until you get it and begin to use it. We like the sound quality of the speaker.
My only gripe is the lack of certain apps on the Kindle store, but it's only a handful. Lightweight good resolution - good for those not willing to drop $100s on iPads.
I bought this item for my nephew and he loves it. I have the old version of the fire hd and I love it as well. It's way cheaper than buying an apple tablet. We haven't had any problems with it. Well worth your money
nice for this price................................
I love it! Not only is it good for listening to music, it's great for asking questions too. I love being able to ask how my commute will be!Alexa is always gaining new skills too. Now it works with my home automation system!
Works great we use it everyday and love to ask questions
I simply like so much that i do recommend it to all
My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books.
I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
Nice Amazon Fire tablet But...the camera is not clear enough 2.0 megapixels and Amazon Fire is very slow wedsite and app it takes very forever download I think I have to returned on best buy and buy a good tablet 10.1 Lenovo and Samsung Galaxy...I will gave a Zero Rating Star
I gave this to my 6-year old for Christmas and it has been the perfect gift. Great price point (compared to an ipad) that can function for exactly what she needs.
Good tablet for the price. It is fast, battery life is ok.
In the past I have avoided tablets at such a low price point, and while I was skeptical of this one as well it has been a great purchase. I use it for tasks I would normally do on my phone such as web browsing, streaming videos, reading, and Android games. It performs all of these tasks admirably. Battery is great as well. I can get up to 7-8 hours depending on the task at hand. It is small enough to always have with me (typing this review on it now), yet large enough to give that real tablet feel as opposed to my phone. I have already purchased another for a friend. At this price you cannot go wrong!
Although the Price point is a bit high for what it is I love the new kindle. The screen is beautiful, the back light with auto-adjust dimming is great, and it feels very sturdy to hold. I am very glad that I upgraded form the nook but can only give 4 stars due to price.
As a gift for a friend, it works very well for the countries which have corresponding Amazon service such as China.
Very easy to use, excellent sound for music listening, able to use it to control all my smart home items, highly recommend
It's Great! I like being able to add things to my shopping list and set timers just by asking.
Bought 2 of these for family members and they absolutely loved them! Connected to Wifi with no problems and downloaded apps quickly.
Love love love it!!! Best purchase ever!!! Love listening to music and sound is great!!!
After seeing and playing with the Amazon Echo at my sister's home, I just had to have one. After having it for a bit, I'm looking towards the future and what Alexa will hopefully do next. Already have the Nest thermostat and Hue lighting, but there's more potential. Will wait and see...
This was a Christmas gift to me. I love it! It stays in the kitchen and whenever anybody is busy in the kitchen it is nice to listen to whatever song you're thinking of. Hand free of course. Ask it anything you will get an answer. Very handy item to have.
This is a great addition to my OTA TV programming. It's the best thing since I left cable TV for broadcast TV!
The Amazon Echo provides both a way to coordinate household appliances but also answers to b all your questions. Easy to use, maximum effectiveness. I discover new uses for my Echo every day. Coordinates tasks with my cellphone and allows for programming contingencies (if this, then that). I love it.
Tv look good in my room so I kind see videos thats good for me! !
This was discounted on Best Buy better than Amazon. It is a great device and even better $50 off
I love this Fire TV. Much faster than the fire stick.
Good basic tablet.Good basic tablet.Good basic tablet.
I like the size! The screen is perfect for my online reading textbooks for school!
Love my echo. Great for the kitchen! Have used it often. Purchased one for my son and he loves his too.
I purchased the kindle Fire for my Uncle. He has really enjoyed this product. Easy to operate, variety of games and books. Also, this model has a camera!
Easy to setup easy to use! Works great and easy to get started love it
We love it so far. We are still learning more about it.
An excellent choice for an inexpensive tablet, the Fire is easy to use wherever WiFi is available. The only minor drawback I've found is the touch-screen is not very sensitive and at times doesn't respond at all.
I would definitely recommend this product for it's sound and quality!
this is the best tablet out there.....great bang for your buck
Nice, clear images, but very slow and the ads on the start screen are annoying. Also, the search engine, Silk, is not very good. Switch to Google if you can. Should have just stuck with the Digiland tablet--a lot more bang for the buck.
This is my third Kindle, first two worked out great for my kids so I got another. Great value for money
Everyone we know who bought echo has loved it. We are looking forward to learning all it can do! So far so good with ease of use.
My kids love this tablet! Good for those long road trips.
No exterior light required. Good battery life. Easy to read at night
This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it
MThere are so many cool features and it's really easy to use.
Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?
She had an older Kindle and after years of good use it finally gave out. I had to buy her a new one and she loves it!
I bought this product as a door prize for a party and it was well received
This item, the Amazon Fire tablet, is a great buy for the price.
Amazing thing instead of cable has amazing apps and cable programs for lower cost
The product is quite nifty. I personally enjoy it. I feel as though it brings everyone in the house together even if we aren't in the same room.
Alexa turns out to be a great source of local information as you're waking up getting breakfast ready, has a great library of songs just for the asking. The gift that you'd pick for yourself.
You will use and enjoy this every day. It's a wide open connection that will amaze and surprise you.
Perfect size tablet that can fit in a purse. Also, decent size screen for watching movies!
very easy to use,and also easy to handle, portable,with a news app. very informative! I would raccomend this tablet to anyone that craves portability. great also for prime members.
Excellent purchase, satisfied my needs for entertaining television!
Love, love, love this! Compact, convenient, great lighting, lightweight.
Very portable. Easy to use. Well worth the price..
This was purchased because every time I would try to stream something from my tv, it would be laggy. This solved my problem. Easy set-up and user friendly.
What is there to say, but that I love it. Functions well, and lasts a long time.
I bought this for my niece .It is user friendly and easy to carry. The features allow her to explore and use her imagination and of course the price was right.
Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
I bought this for my elderly mother who had another tablet that broke. It was easy to set up. More importantly, it's easy for her to understand. I did have to create an Amazon account for her just so I could download her favorite apps. The only challenge I had was she uses Gmail for her email accounts. It took me a couple of tries to get her Gmail into the stock email app. So far, she is happy as a lark with her new tablet.
It was a gift. The individual thoroughly enjoys it.
I love this thing! Awesome for outdoor reading! iPads can't compare. The biggest plus for me is that I'm not bombarded with messages or call and can stay focused on reading.
Upgraded from an original Kindle. Absolutely love it. Even better than my wife's Kindle PaperWhite.
A lot of apps are incomplete. Doesn't run apps that great and has a lot of apps that are generic.
It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it
I've had a few different Kindles since they were introduced and this is my favorite model by far. I love the way they lit - makes it much easier to read in the dark and outside versus reading on a tablet or a phone. The kindle lasts for months or a few books on one charge and is such a great way to have my books always with me on the go.
Excellent, well worth the money. Great screen, easy to use.
This is a great product, that doesn't have a lot of distraction for kids. Great little reader for the price
works like a charm, updates daily. use on a daily basis
This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.
Good product, easy to set up and to use! I purchased it to have DTV Now on a 2nd tv and I received a Apple box from DTV , I like the Amazon box better than the Apple box , more user friendly.
Easiest way for me to buy books for him to read. I'm an Amazon prime member and this is an easy download.... plus he loves reading on the fire!
Happy with the echo it is a really good device. Will recommend it to others
Brought for my wife, kids took it over! Now am going to purchase two more.
Great product. Easy to use. Tons of features. A must for every room (with a tv) in the house.
The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT"S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!
My only complaint is that the charger does not fit in snugly to the device and I have replaced several devices as I could not get it to charge. They should take a look at Apple products and how they are constructed.
I love my Amazon Echo. It's a terrific product with excellent voice recognition. The features available are continually improving and expanding. Highly recommended for anyone considering a smart home device.
Lots of useful skills to configure the Echo to your personal interests. It also is very good for playing music.
The echo is the first thing my husband and I listen to every morning, so easy to use.
The tablet was a good gift for Christmas. I bought it on black Friday for a cheap price
Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat.
My daughter like her tablet it's so simple to use.
Had one in the past and it was stolen. So glad I could get this st a good price.
My Alexa doesn't recognize Agoura hills. Does not play free music. How can I get those to work
So, the only downfall is Alexa doesn't pair with my iCal. Otherwise she's great to have.
The tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several Kindle books. But only the price is the only note worthy thing about it. If you buy it for 50 bucks, you have pay another 15 to remove the ads and since this is from Amazon, there is no Google Play to get more app selection.True, you can try to side load the Google Apps but the average tablet buyer won't do this. Also, the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the iPad Mini or other decent Android slates. I'd recommend a Samsung tablet or an iPad before I would recommend this, unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money.
Was not planning on buying this, but the price pulled me in. Glad I picked it up.
The kids really enjoy this. They play for hours on them. Keeps them occupied.
Ask any questions about anything including playing music favorites. Save time by getting information ASAP.
Very happy with the performance of the fire tv. I also have first gen fire stick and the load time and lack of buffering on the fire tv is great. I'm also a prime member and the quantity of programming is pretty god. Would definitely recommend.
Very pleased with the tablet. This is our fourth one we have owned.
Mom likes this allot, once she started using it. She was hesitant at first because it's something new! But that didn't last long.
Unless you have fiber optic internet, don't buy this. If you have ATT Uverse it will mess up the TV, lower the speed of your internet, and play havoc with the phone.It has not worked yet since getting it, since I only have 25mgb of internet, and it really does not work at that speed at all.
This was a big help in cutting the cable cord - its great saving money
I would recommend this to anyone who wants a portable device like this. It is well worth the price.
Had some issues but now it's fine and we have a lot of fun using alexa
I bought this tablet because of the excellent apps it offers and it's easy to use.
Kids love being able to use this item as well! Very good for their little hands to use.
Got this as a gift for a friend. She had a little issue trying to set up at first but got it going eventually
This item is exactly what I was looking for. It is a perfect size for home or travel. It is very loud for its size.
This table does everything you NEED.. not necessarily everything you want. But It's great for the $$ you pay and it's really handy. I take it around with me all the time.
Fantastic product for streaming online content. Great for gaming.
The box gives you everything Fire TV Stick does and A lot more. Expandable SD storage and USB storage. Both can be used for more apps or your personal videos. Also connect gaming controllers. PS4 controller works great.
easy to set up, still getting the hang of all the features and really enjoying this - far more than I even imagined. If you're into sports and are looking for schedules, scores, etc. this is great!
Bought this for my young cousins and they love it!
I bought this for my daughter. It's a little limited in what it can do, but she loves it. She's a little too young to understand the games, but she loves watching cartoons on it.
Was bought for a gift for my mother. She loves it and works great
This tablet absolutely surprised me. The screen is awesome and the battery life is great.
I absolutely love my kindle fire. I received cash back for purchasing a new MacBook Pro Retina laptop and purchased the Kindle and cover jacket.
The tab is very good for the price what is being offered. Allows to have separate kid profile as well so that they don't have access to unwanted stuff. YouTube app can be installed as well.
i bought two of these to gift, but i kind of want to keep them for myself.
Alexa is fun and witty and. Very convenient,, especially when I need a timer when cooking.
This tablet is perfect for me, my kids, and for on the go. It's a brand I trust.
This is very fast and no buffering for non Amazon movies. I definitely recommend this product. I got this one in deal not paying full price at Best buy beats the others in price and product performance.
Bought this for my grandson for Christmas. It's a decent tablet for the price I paid. i find it much different than Samsung tabs or Apple iPad. so if you're used to these, amazon might not be a good pick for you. My grandson is disappointed we can't get YouTubekids on it. I've caught myself saying I should have paid a little more and gotten a Samsung. All in all, decent Tablet for a kid.
Bought it so my son would stop grabbing for my phone. Does what it needs to but battery life is horrible
My son love his kindle! Perfect size and good price
Got this for my daughter and mother I'll law for Christmas and they both love them.good price and seems to b a quality tablet
This tablet is not going to be a flagship tablet. Considering you're paying about 10% of the price of an iPad, this does more than 10% of what an iPad can do. Netflix, browsing, emails all work great! Can't complain.
The tablet is great for reading. It does not allow you to download many of the games my child enjoys which are usually available on other tablets.
works for my purposes. It is easy to use and easy for my kids to use
It's a great tablet for a destructive 10 year old. It's still going strong for 2 months now
Great product and works very well with no buffering on wifi.
I had this set up in minutes. Very easy. The sound is great. Wonderful variety of features. Love it!!!
Fire tablets never disappoints! Great price, used my certificate points which helpedAlways best price at best but
I like that this tablet can grow with my 5 year old. I love the various age settings and the parental controls. Perfect first tablet!
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
I had purchased a tablet for my son as s Christmas gift and he loved it, he let me use it and I loved it, especially since I have problems with my hands. This tablet proved to be the best thing for me. My experience with Best Buy is the best choice I could make on my tablet. The staff is fantastic, they helped me to get the basics down pat, you can add me to your list of return consumers.
After two broken iPad screens we switched to this fire tablet for our daughter. It's been amazing. So much more durable and amazon games have actually free where it includes in app purchases.
I realized after I bought this and tried to use it with a mobile hotspot that it requires WiFi to operate. I didn't return it because I'm moving to a place that has WiFi in a few days and will try to get it to work.
My kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. We have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. While if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are OK but Im afraid the processing power of these "kids" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. Time will only tell.
No longer takes charge from manufacture charger or any other type of charger. Product did not last very long since had 7 months.
This is a replacement for a kindle purchased several years ago. Happy to find the price went down and the product is better than ever. I highly recommend as an internet tool for both adults and children
The Paper white replaces my original Kindle. I really like the new screen because it is easy on my eyes. Great improvement to an already great product. May purchase one for my wife.
I'm very happy with this kindle. Is light and easy to carry everywhere. I like to read at nights and this is way better than having a light on.
this is better than having Dish network or Direct TV program in what you need and there it is.
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it!
Great piece of technology. Very easy to set up and use. So, easy to have her play your favorite music, get weather, news updates, etc.
Good value!
Easy to use (and fun too!).Great for math and history questions and perfect for making a shopping list.
I had a Kindle Fire HD 6" but felt it was too small a screen and too heavy for how small it was. The Kindle Fire 7" is perfect for me. I don't watch movies or videos so not having HD doesn't bother me. I am enjoying this one more.
Bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Tab that was about 3 years old and seemed to be running slow and was a bit heavy for a 7inch tablet. This is much lighter and since I will probably use it mostly to read books and play games like candy crush it is fast and easy to use. Very happy with it so far.
I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat.
Best bang for the buck. Can't be beat for reading. The best bookstore and readers experience.
Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .
I bought and returned this item. I was hoping to be able to watch different sports games via the internet with the Amazon Fire TV but everything I selected stated it wasn't available. After trying different things for a few days, I figured I wasn't going to get the results I wanted and returned the unit.
Great starter tablet for a first time tablet owner. Bought this for my mom, and she loves it! Great for watching Netflix and surfing the web!
We got this for my son for xmas. He loves it. He uses it daily.
I purchased 2 kindle fires for my two youngest nieces! They have not sat them down-love them! Easy to connect & navigate
I love the size and features of the Kindle Paperwhite.
I purchased this gift for a family who didn't have much and I wanted to bless their kids with something nice. This made their day and was exactly what they wanted. I purchased two of them originally but now I might buy two more.
Tablet was a Christmas gift, it is just right for the purposes mentioned
Your mileage may vary, but... I picked up both the Google Home and the Amazon Echo because I wanted to see which one was best. Oddly, Amazon Echo pairs better with my work accounts (GSuite/Google Apps for Biz) because Google Home doesn't do that yet. For home automation, Echo can't be beat. For playing podcasts, Echo is on top of it. For answering questions, Google Home allows me to get to my answer a lot faster with better sources. In terms of audio quality, Echo is top dog. Can it hear you from across the room? Yeah, in fact - mine can hear me from outside my office 3 rooms away.Has it changed my routines? Yep. I love the Flash Briefing. The skills, for now, are mostly useless or "add-ons" to the Flash Briefing. It can read your audio books and Kindle books (and they do a freebie monthly) - but as I listen at 3x speed to most of my audio books, it's not the most helpful thing ever (because there's no speed control yet).Is it the Computer from the Enterprise? Not yet. It can't perform complex tasks like, "Alexa, find me a 4 or 5-star Chinese Restaurant nearby and make a reservation", cannot call out (hey Skype, where are you?), and cannot send text messages or write emails.There's some connecting the dots that will have to happen for this to be life-changing, but for now, it's pretty good.
Purchased this after extensive research between the Echo and the Google home. I must say that this is surprisingly handy. Weather updates in the morning and news headlines read back to me is pretty cool. The echo is very expandable with all the skills you can download to it to make it even better with its knowledge. There are some things that the Google Home does better as far as its answering (Google's search vs Bing) some questions and it's better at interacting with the person speaking, but I feel that Amazon will be learning to do the same thing with their future updates.
Bought this for my wife who loves books. She was always agents ebooks but now she can't be without it.
I love this thing. I had one of the original ones before I got this one and I love that one. So when I got this it blew me away. So many new functions still so reliable. And now I can read in the dark. Amazing.
This was a christmas gift for my nephew, he really enjoy playing games a watching videos, its a cheap and good alternative to the i-Pad :-)
The Amazon ECHO with the dots placed around the house provide the perfect companion with all your daily tasks. I have Echo connected to my Hue lights and EchoBee Thermostats.
Excellent device. Screen is impressive. Happy with this purchase, and looking forward to reading many books on it!
We just love this item - had a problem with getting the correct temperature. Had to get technical support to help us. It has since been resolved
Really like this device helpful and fun. We like the accurate data and the fun skills. Can't wait to connect our lights
Bought tablet for myself (50 something) Wanted something for travel and easy to store.This was perfect for my needs.Bigger than small screen phone and smaller than computer. I've had no trouble with WiFi or streaming such as hulu or netflix. As mentioned for the price you cant beat it.
This tablet is great for the kids. And it was cheap when I got it. Its recommendable for kids when they play games
So, its ok. I mean, it's not as fast or as seamless as the Apple TV, but it's cheaper. This is my 2nd one. The first one bricked after 15 months of steady use, so because the warranty was expired I bought a new one. I got it home and the remote stopped working for it on the 2nd day. I had just spent a week going back and forth with Amazon trying to troubleshoot my bricked firebox so I wasn't about to delve back into the quagmire that is Amazon customer service. I ended up just downloading the remote app for it instead. If you're a prime member it's a good choice, but if your not just get an Apple TV or roku.
awesome product. Very glad I made the small investment to get this. I don't even have to use my cable anymore because of this small device.
Great product I bought 2 very fast hardly no lag..
The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors.
This is the best media box for Kodi on a budget. Works great and everything loads just fine
This tablet exceeded my expectations in so many ways! Bought the first a couple months ago for my son's 5th birthday, at this price, i wouldnt be heartbroken if he broke it. Then i got one for my niece, planning to get 2 more, see how excited i am about it? Well worth the price!!
User friendly the best speaker this year recommend to all my friends
My husband gave me one for Christmas and I love It!!!! My entire family uses it. My son is visually impaired so he has access to so much with alex!!!
I use the Echo every day! From getting weather to daily news to listening to SiriusXM I can say the device is very simple to use. There are so many skills you can download to make your Echo interact with Alexa in so many different ways. It goes on sale quite often so wait till it drops below $100.
Bought this for my grand daughter. Very easy to navigate. A very good price. No problems at all
Echo is a fun device. Music sounds good. You can ask basic questions. Nothing that Apple's Siri can't already answer. One big downfall is that the device is not rechargeable, so the device is NOT portable, you are tethered to the wall; that is unless you buy the Portable Battery Base for Echo which will add another 49.00 to an already 179.00 price. Other than that, it is easy to install.
I bought this product for my nephew for Christmas. I was very impressed with how cheap it was price wise. He took it out of the box to use and it was very user friendly when it was set up. He enjoyed being able to download his games and how easy it was to use altogether. Thank you Best Buy and Amazon for making it the best Christmas ever
The Echo is everything expected. Lots of fun asking questions and quite handy being that hubby is full of them.
Want a port for addition memory this model had it!
Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
It's the thing to have, to go along with the crowd, but it ends up being very much underutilized. I'm sure it's capable of more than making a shopping list and doing a flash briefing. But we don't have the time to learn. Other than that, it works just fine.
The Kindle Paperwhite does one thing and does it incredibly well. It's a great way to read books. The screen is wonderful in bright light and the backlight's great for reading in bed without disturbing your partner. If you're a reader, this is a no-brainer.
Love this tablet. So much easier to read than my previous ones. Great price too!
Love everything about it. Does everthing it says it will only better than the other devices I have. The only negative is it does not have an optical out. But that is not something that would make me not buy it again.
It's the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoons and play games. The protection is awesome!
My wife and I couldn't be happier with our Amazon Echo! With our home wifi it was so easy to setup ! Alexa what did we ever do without you ! Look if your looking at reviews then you've done some research and know what the Echo is all about and all it can do ! Don't hesitate buy it now !
love the easy set up, the navigation is very intuitive. Great to have access to all my music uploaded to Amazon Prime Music. Alexa works well too to play and pause music and shows.
I really like the Echo, but be warned that you are still very dependent on your iPad to get the most out of your purchase, especially as it relates to music.
This works almost seamlessly! Very little buffer and runs all apps well.
This is great for reading. I can adjust font and brightness. I can also access email and download apps. Sometimes it is slower than I'd like but for A inexpensive option it's not bad at all. I bring it with me all the time
Liked it a lot,, Liked it a lot, liked it a lot!!!
While I have used an ipad in the past, this is hands down a huge improvement in the ability to read books. The backlighting and type font are great and it is extremely easy to download books.
Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too.
Better loading, longer battery life, clearer picture, more space. Still just as durable!
I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product.
Root to cyanogenmod and it becomes a good inexpensive android tablet.
Great tablet for kids since it's price friendly, and it has an option for child users.
Is very easy to use and set up . Love it for music and shopping list .
Great value for the price, recipient is enjoying it very much!
Perfect size, not to small or not to big. The built in light really helps. Great reader if just reading you are looking for.
Pretty much this is worth it just to have Alexa play anything from Prime Music. My kids love talking to Alexa (once she understand them) and I use the timer function all the time while cooking. Only keeps one shopping list and one to-do list but its great to just say something and have it added to a list. Alexa is great for the capabilities she has, but the skills are limited so far so I recommend looking into capabilities or plan on programming your own. For example, she doesn't come out of the box able to read your email even though she can access google calendar. She is also not proactive, such as notifying you of a phone call or email. But overall, fun add-on if you are in the market for a speaker.
I like the tablet but the ads can be a little offensive from time to time. I wish you could block ads for magazines and game with immodestly dressed people especially on the lock screen. The device is very nice for what I paid for it once you get passed the lock screen.
My granddaughter loves to play games on this tablet. At the same time she can look for information on internet for her school homework. Another think I like about it, is that you can use an sd card for extra storage. It's very user friendly!
Music (great sound), news, sports updates, commute condition and a whole lot more! The nice thing is more available content is consistently coming out. What a versatile, fun piece of electronics!
On sale for my 3 year old and he loves it, mostly used for movies and games.
I have time to do what I have to do just because Alexis
Excellent platform for enabling a variety of software applications. Faster processor than the fire stick, which helps against any potential buffering issues.
Excellent speaker, love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed. A very good digital assistant and lots of fun to use.
The Amazon fire is a good tablet for everyday use.
Great for watching movies when traveling. Perfect for watching on an airplane.
Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.
I have been playing with Echo for a couple of weeks. Its well worth the price want to hear a special song just tell the Echo bang she played it, sports scores you name it she got the answer.
Good startup tablet for reading articles online & shop
Small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.
Love the Echo, great addition to the house. Will do everything you need.
I am so happy with the Kindlefire. I bought the first generation Kindlefire & I was happy with it. When I bought this new Kindlefire I was happily & surprised at how much better this version is. I use the Kindlefire mainly for watching movies & reading books. So.happy with it :)
biased in favor of right handed persons but performs as promised. it would be nice if a lefty could move pages with his left hand as a righty can move pages with his right hand.
very easy to set-up. a big hit a parties, excellent speaker.
Pluses and minuses when compared to the Roku. Plus - can use the Alexa feature Minus- can not use the USB port to play videos from a USB like on the Roku. Plus - some channels not found on the Roku ( i think ) Minus - harder to find Channels when compared to the Roku.All and all a nice streamer
There are so many advantages to the Fire TV box. It has an Ethernet connection and a USB port. Add a wireless keyboard or flash drive. It's got 4K and it is fast. The fire stick is more reasonable priced but it's not as fast and doesn't have any USB or Ethernet connection. If you have a few bucks more, go for the Fire TV box.
I purchased this box in hopes of using it for the new Playstation Vue service which it did run pretty well. It does everything they say it does but one of the main issues I had with the original and still have with this is the interface. The layout for the main screen and the ads they throw in your face are just ridiculous. After using Roku for years, the Nvidia Shield TV, and the new Apple TV I would recommend any of those over this device any day. They offer a much cleaner interface and more functionality for the most part (except playstation vue).
This was a Christmas present for my daughter, she reads big books very fast. When we bought the Kindle Paperwhiye we signed up for the Amazon Prime now she reads up to 5 books a week.
I am more interested in a reader not a tablet the one thing I don't like about this reader is I cannot make the font when reading large enough
I really like the feel and ease of use. It's a great tablet for the price.
Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
Bought for my wife for mothers day, as she wanted something to read in the sunshine this summer, and it performs amazingly in that respect. We have iPads and regular Kindle Fire units (the kids), but only this one can be read in any light, any time of day. Only 4 stars as I'm not sure why terribly more expensive than the Fire units, but it solves for those who like to read under sunlight at the beach or by the pool, couldn't be clearer.
We are super happy with the Amazon Fire. We are using it more than our DirectTv. Quality is good and user friendly.
Excellent product. Good Price and a good buy for the entertainment.Will recommend to others.
I very Much enjoy Alexa. A lot of fun. Very helpful. Excellent gift
So the only complaint I could see most people had was that the battery life was poor compared to previous/non-backlit versions. I will say that is true, however, with about an hour to 30 minutes of reading, I can go a few weeks between charges. I feel that is very reasonable.As with the Kindle e-readers, I have had very good luck with them. They are well built, devices and very easy on the eyes. The device has a good texture and does not feel like it will slip out of your hand while reading.Overall I'm very happy with my new Kindle. Its so much easier on the eyes! Worth every penny!
Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up
The kindle paper white is a great size and weight. I live in New York so while I'm on the train and can't sit down to read, this kindle offers convenience because you can comfortably hold it in one hand. I was against e-readers at first but after this purchase I definitely appreciate them.
Bought for my grandson he doesn't like it it's to slow..
Keep up the good work, works fine with smart lights
I purchased two tablets for Christmas gifts and they were great!
For the price it seems like a very good tablet. I was disappointed that it came with absolutely NO instructions. So if you were new to tablets you could find yourself at a complete loss as to how to set it up.
I purchased this tablet to read books online and I love it the screen is nice.
Always loved the Amazon Echo. Now we can rake it with us, outside, wherever!
Love how many possibilities there are with this product.
What can I say. We just love it. We listen to the news briefing every morning and music during the day.
Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
My wife went on a cruise and when she came back found out she was replaced by Alexa... just kidding.Great sound for music, helps kids with homework, make grocery lists, weather and traffic, lots it can do. I got it for $88 on a surprise 1 day sale thru Best Buy.
Love this product. Very fast and no buffering lag.
I love the fire sticks and this is definitely the top dog. Very fast.
This is a great little starter tablet for my son and his cousins!
so i got this device to start setting up home automation. the first thing is that my kids love it. my wife gets to sing all her pandora songs. it also works great and sounds good.
It's okay for a beginner tablet to me. Not enough apps for purchase. I like the play store better.
We purchased this TV for a guest room/office. It has an excellent picture and great sound.
Got it for the sole purpose of controlling my home lighting. Works perfect!
good for reading on the fly and great battery life
I bought this Fire tv because I have unsmart tv that I would like to watch Netflix in, and I think it was a good thing to do and it is not expensive
I purchased this for my 7yr old who loves reading but also loves the apps and games available. This has a fast load time and I recommend a SD card to go with it. We needed it after a few days of downloading books and apps.
I bought a Kindle Fire 16GB for my 6 year old son in June. After 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. Best Buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. Amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! They have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if I buy a new one. Amazon does not stand behind this product. They are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.
My daughter loves this tablet. Easy to use and great battery life.
I had to buy this Amazon - Fire - 7 Tablet - 8GB - Black, as the price was right.What a great device. I did not expect it to perform the way it has. I have streamed video, read books and installed a 64GB sdcard i had laying around. Great for travel, due to the price I really have not lost anything if it is lost or damaged.
I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.
I like all the functions that it offers and then some
I bought this product since my wife purchasers a number of books from amazon. We also wanted easy access to our emails.
I've owned several of the Amazon devices (box and sticks), and love the new 4K box!
Perfect size and easy on the eyes. None of that bright light that tables have to blind you in the evening.
Best Buy and it's employees in the Granville, WV store made my Christmas. Thank you so much. I had ordered my product on line from Amazon and UPS lost my package. Never heard anything else from UPS when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me. Amazon did refund my money, but they were out of the product to reorder. Best Buy had my product and had it waiting for me when I got to the store. This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter . Thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in less than one hour....Yay for best buy. I also bought a lap top a few months ago from the same store. Then today I bought a few other items. So happy with your products and especially your customer service.....
If you install kodi you get access to tons of movie although some are low res
I understand you get what you pay for but come on Amazon. You make millions a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup. The only thing this tablet is good for is collecting dust. In my opinion, if any company is going to integrate the AndroidOS at least make it user friendly and 100% open. It's basically like purchasing half of a device or a demo device.
its been nice to have someone like Alexa in our home
She started using it the same day and reads books every day now.
old one broke after 9 years, new paper white is great, can read in low light, etc.
I got this for 35 dollars as part of Thanksgiving promotion. Its normal price is 50. Its a good starting level tab for basic purpose. Its not as smooth as IPAD or Galaxy note but its ok for basic browsing. I specifically got this for my 3 year old to watch Youtube and play some light games and it works perfect. I am not much used to android so I found it a bit tricky to use. It also has a slot for microSD card so that solves your memory issues.
Nice to listen to music and tv anywere in my home.
Alexa is a great source of knowledge. Love her!!!!
Great for kids gotta love amazon they are the best!
The only thing I don't like is the power plug it sometimes don't want to charge
The remote works great manually or in voice mode. It takes a little time to learn to navigate the applications. But it was a good purchase.
First I must say out of the box I'd rate this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons.1)No Google Play store (which means no Google apps) and stuck with Amazon App Store.2)Have to pay $15 to remove ad filled lockscreenHowever I rooted the device within 30 minutes of owning it which A)installs Google Play services and B)removes the ad lockscreen. The tablet is now easily 5 stars. I wanted something to mainly read books, magazines and news on. This does those things great. I've also tested a few videos form a few sites like Prime Video & YouTube and it works great. Sure, there are better looking tablets out there with better screens but this one works fine for what I want.Overall I'd highly recommend this tablet if you root it and install Google Play Store. If you want to keep it as is out of the box, I'd recommend staying away from Amazon and going a full fledged Andriod tablet like Samsung.
At a price that doesn't require a bank loan or cashing in that retirement annuity.
Easy to use reliable interface possible house hold money saver, if properly moded lol
If it understands your question it works quite well. I enjoy it for music and basic knowledge.
Great price for the tablet. My granddaughters love it.
This is my first kindle paperwhite.Great battery life and Best E-paper tablet.
I got this to put kodi on and stream 4K stuff. Works great
So much faster then the stick. Worth the extra money
Basic tablet with good features. Does everything you need it to do. Great for social media, YouTube,Netflix, etc... not too much storage space, but additional storage options like SD card are available.
Pretty dumb that you have to.buy a charger port
Enjoying the kindle reading watching movies playing games
This is her second Kindle product. she loves the new colors and bigger screen.
I love my new Kindle! Very easy to use and a great price!!! I take it everywhere!
Alexa has become part of the family and her ability to interact is awesome!
The Amazon Fire is a great tablet and it is very easy to use.
I bought this for my son and ended up leaving with one for myself! For a $50 tablet I can't complain it does what it says and has expendable memory my son loves his and I'm satisfied with mine.
I like the tablet for basic use, but definitely enough for any kid
I like how it plays music. It is perfect to connect to smart home products. Such as nest, Belkin , and many others. It is easy to use.
I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.
Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!
I have bought a lot of tablets for my kids and all have broken. This tablet has lasted the longest and is the most kid friendly.
I love this Kindle. It's the best one yet. I've owned the original Kindle, Fire, and Fire HD. Until I bought the paper white, I preferred reading actual books over all E-Readers. E-Reader were just more convenient to deal with. No books to travel with and no need to find a place to store them. I'm now an advocate of the paper white because its just like reading a book.
I recently decided to be a cord cutter and not have cable anymore, just internet. I currently have a Samsung 60" Smart 4K UHD and the Samsung 4K Blu-Ray player and a PC that I use to access all my online content.I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV and discovered that I already have access to just about everything the Amazon Fire TV has through mny TV, Blu-ray player and PC.This is a great device but for me it was just redundant.
Brought this for my daughter and it's been a life saver!!! I love that it already comes with the pink bumper it's perfect for her!! Set up was also a breeze!!! I'm very pleased with this purchase.
If you are an Amazon Prime member this tablet works well. It is designed so you have easy access to Prime Books, Amazon Music.
My wifes last Kindle gave out after about 5 years so I went with the fire this time and she loves it.
so far so good I own this for almost a year and no freeze when Im watching a movie via stream
It's a handy little tool to have for reading e-Books.
Really enjoying the Echo. There are a ton of features that we are still learning so it will be a while before we understand its full capabilities.
Nice unit - easy to setup and initialize. I like the availability of the secure digital memory card - can put my music and movies on the card and not take up the internal memory.
I have 2 of these one for each one of my kids I love it for kids the instead of buying something so expensive I chose this and the geek squad protection is awesome my son cracked the screen and they where just amazing and replaced it with a brand new one
The tablet is great for my 7 Year old to play on and I like that it has parent control on it.
Works very well for children and people of all ages.
Very good for kids to learn and play games and research school work.
Perfect product for senior citizen who just wants to do a little internet shopping and receive and send emails. Nice size screen and easy to use. Great gift for a lot less investment than an ipad or laptop.
My son loves the kindle we got for him. It's perfect for the little guys to watch Netflix on.
It works as advertised, great for college students
The family love's asking questions. We also enjoy the shopping list and jokes.
This is a great product! Our family loves the convenience of asking questions on the go!
My wife and I have been cordcutting for a while with a Roku TV on one TV and a PS4, I decided to try the Amazon Fire TV...WOW this device is beyond awesome. I live the alexa integration to find movies. the only way it would be better is if Alexa could tune to channels on PlayStation Vue. The ability to clone my Android phone to this device is great as well. I would very highly recommend this device
My other one last for two years. Than went out. My daughter loves it
I can't believe it's so cheap now. I had the previous model and it was great. I mostly use it for reading, but it's great that you can add other apps to pass the time.
It's a great little gadget , but I'm a little bit disappointed she doesn't understand my accent to well .
Love the Amazon Echo. Easy to set up and I learn new features every day. Fun to use.
This tablet was for my great-grandson and he loved it
What a good gift for granddaughters. Price was great
my son enjoy it so much. he is so happy with that tablet
This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want.
Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account
This is my first tablet and I really like it. Easy to use and I like the touch screen a lot better then the tablet my kid got at another store. Perfect size for my hand.
The firetv has a compact, sleek design, is easy to set up and also has the ability to configure using cat5 cable, which for my area is much faster than WIFI.
This tablet was bought to replace my Kindle Fire that had lost its video. I haven't used it a lot yet, but what I've done seems to work good. 8gb of internal storage and up to 128gb additional with a sd card gives you plenty of room for pictures,games, ebooks or videos. I will probably rate it higher once I've used it more.
excellent for children school without breaking the bank
Got this for my nephew for Christmas and he hasn't put it down :) he loves it
I got this as a Christmas present. Had wondered if it really was so easy on the eyes and good in different lighting. Much better than I had hoped!
I like that it is lightweight and it has the built in light.
kids love it EZ to use great Quality bought this for the grand kids had super reviews also free Amazon for a year 2 year warranty its the best buy out there
The Fire makes easy reading. I also love the internet capabilities and the apps that I can access with ease. The horizontal book format for reading makes it even better to read through each book. I receive my emails quickly wherever I may be, as long as I am connected to wifi. I would recommend the Fire to anyone. And the personnel at the Beat Buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process.
This probably the most amazing electronic device I have in the home. Only thing that would make it better was if I could connect it to sound bar for a little better sound but this thing will answer almost anything. Well worth the money. Everyone should have at least one - we have 2 now and will buy more.
I recently bought this for my son who HP tablet died on him a month before I got him the Fire. Best thing I've done!! It didn't cost a lot and it's made solid with beautiful deep colors and smooth video playback. I'm seriously thinking of buying one for myself soon. If you are looking for a tablet to play games and watch movies this the perfect little travel mate for you.
These were gifts for young family members and they are really enjoying them, but the initial setup was a pain
I'm a huge fan of these tablets. If you aren't trying to spend a lot of money, or if you aren't an avid daily user, this will easily do all the basic necessities
This was the perfect tablet for my wife for Christmas, she loves it. Easy to navigate and plenty of room for her favorites!
This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.
The kindle white is an excellent ereader which is lightweight. It allows you to hold with one hand with no problem. Additionally there is enough room on the sides to hold with two hands without making pages constantly turn.
Absolutely makes my home feel more updated. I use her to control all of my lights and TV's
I bought this for my husband for Christmas so we haven't used it yet.
Bought this to replace one I had from about 6 years ago. Why did I wait so long. The newer models bigger screen is so nice and it's so much faster!
It is really easy to program and use. I am looking forward to connecting it to some of the smart items I have In my home.
Great basic tablet for kids and novices. Worth a try
I normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so I gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself. I must say that I cant put it down i love it so much.
Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
Ive cut the cable cord thanks to the firestick! !!
Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well.
ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
I never thought that I would need an e-reader since I have the samsung Note, but I am now would not read on the Note anymore. The paperwhite makes reading so much better, my eyes don't feel tired as quick with the paperwhite. Highly recommended!!!
I like the Kindle Fire. I use it to access my movies and apps. I use it for my gaming apps.
This is the perfect starter media player for someone who is new to online media. Mom loves it
There are so many ways to use the echo that I have barely scratched the surface.
Bought this for my mother in law who is having trouble reading small print. Didn't want to spend as much as a kindle paperwhite, so this was a reasonable compromise to give her the option of adjusting the light and size of the font when she is reading.
This product is amazing! It was an easy set up. Plug and play. And good to go!
You can find thousands of movies and your favorite shows
My in laws looove this tech. They are soon going to be adding more wireless items in the house!
love it. sound quality is really good and it looks and feels amazing
Much better than a fire stick. Well worth the extra money.
I have found little to complain about since purchasing this device. It's sturdy, bright, and a touchscreen.Perfect for what you use it for. Get a nice case for it and it becomes indestructible!
This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately), it's a quality product to have.
I have been very pleased with the Whitepaper e-reader so far. Good battery life and easy to use.
I wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so I could look up stuff, such as information about movies I watch on TV, or answers to the New York Times crossword puzzle, or anything else I was curious about. I didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. I decided that for a measly fifty bucks (plus $20 for extra storage), it was worth a shot. I found that it's perfect for my purposes - relatively fast and easy to use. I haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be OK there, too. I'm happy I bought it.
I love the paperwhite. I had one of the first versions of the kindle that had the keyboard and loved it. Only downfall was it was not backlit. The paperwhite is and it is awesome!
Great product, my customer really enjoyed receiving it.
I love it because it is functional and complete for I needed.
This was a Christmas present to our 4 year old grandson and he loves it. He was so excited when he opened it on Christmas! It is a perfect tablet for a 4 year old!
I was looking for a Kindle Fire because I have had other android tablets in the past and most times the Kindle app makes them crash or takes up too much space on the tablet. I like it for reading but it isn't as great for other things and you are not allowed to have the Google Play store on it because that competes with the Amazon app store. However, not all apps are available on the Amazon app store so this was an immediate drawback for me. I will keep this and use it but in the future I will not buy Kindle tablets again.
not only s it a great product but the sales staff especially mike Whitt tremendously patient and skilled in showing me the basics of the device!
Mainly use it for playing music, was going to connect to Apple Music, but found it much easier to use amazon music and amazon offers a lower priced plan if you just use amazon music for Alexa. I have an outlet switch connected which is convenient for turning on/off lights. It has a good speaker for playing music. I think Alexa is comparable to Siri.
My 10yr old loves it . He stays on the pad for hours and never get bored ....
I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
Perfect tablet for my 7 year old girl. She really enjoys it.
I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.
Great tablet for just paying a bill or surfing Internet
This is a great little tablet for the money and does nearly everything you would want to do with a tablet. I plan to use it for travel and leave my expensive iPad Air 2 home. I was impressed with the resolution when viewing photos and it works well for reading email and Internet surfing. It is also great to have adequate storage by adding a micro card to the unit. Probably the major drawback is the camera, which does not take a very good picture when compared to cell phones and other tablets. Again, for the money, it's a great value for a small tablet.
So we gave it to my 1yr old for christmas, on the box it says if you break any way theyll replace, 30sec after opening he throws it down and jumps on .... works great lol loves watching spongbob on lol
For the price this Amazon is amazing. Just like the echo but smaller. I show everyone how great it is.
Love this product. Neat design and easy to navigate.
A lot of fun it is great I can wait to try all the features of it on my home I'm going to get the lights
Love it and looking to by another more for my house or Christmas gift.
I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar "carousel" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader.
$35 tablet, its a no brainer. great gift for the kids
This is a great first tablet for kids. Lots of game and the battery life is good!
Great buy! Good value value for the money & easy to use.
love the big screen, clear pictures and fast loading. battery lasts long. I use it every day !
Alexa is great; however, since we have a couple lamps hooked up through Vivint; we ask her to turn them on and off. No matter how clearly or different ways we say it; she often gets confused as to which lamp to turn on/off or anything at all.
Love to use for news and weather Has been helpful getting information from internet Great Applience
I love just saying to play a particular album, or songs from a particular artist, or specific music such as Jazz.
I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and very happy with it
I think it's a good starter tablet for a child. It makes it a lot easier to monitor your child while online.
this is my mothers first tablet ever so we're getting her use to Electronics. She does love it
The one I have been using, generic, is so bad. You have to mess with it to get it to work. I really love this one . Small and plugs in nice and tight.
Love the Echo so much. It really answers your questions, love the skills, and love the music.
Best electronic I purchased for myself this year. Great price too.
my four year old has trashed this one again. it really is great but I need to find ways to make it so the glass doesn't break. the computer itself is wonderful cracked like crazy and I cant cut my fingers.
this tablet is a good for small children it has a good cover
It's realy high quality tablet . My son love it, and it has many educational apps.
Good for A lot of things. Listen to news briefs in the morning. Hooked up my lights to it. Great product
My granddaughter loves her tablet toddler friendly
A great tablet for a good price, it has the basics, works great for a child preferably.
If you have an Amazon Prime account, you should have a fire tablet. It is so easy to have Kindle books, Amazon music and videos at your finger tips. This is $34 or however much I paid well spent. Now, what I don't like about the tablet is the operating system; it is limiting. Bottomline is if you need to do something other than use the Amazon suite of features you will need another tablet. However, I have no problem with using this specifically for the Amazon stuff and for managing my echo dot.
Christmas gift! They were very excited. Think they are working very well.
The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
I haven't had one in years and happy for the newer version.
finally I can read on the beach or outside! I can take many books with me when I travel without the weight and bulk of paperbacks I can also enlarge the font size so no readers are required!. Love this device. Wish they would do something like this for cell phones to read in the sunlight!
Bought this tablet for my daughter and she loves it!
My kids really seem to like this. I really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.
The Echo was an excellent addition to our home. We like asking Alexa things and playing music
It replaces my 6" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality.
Got 2 of these for my grandsons and they love them.
If you are looking for something inexpensive for your kids this Christmas, this is the one.Easy to operate, good quality and size for kids and adults.
I have bought 2 of these, one for my 4 yr old and one for my 6 yr old. Both of them have previously broken tablets before. I am amazed how well these have stood up to them and how well they perform. A super deal for a tablet. I likely will buy another just for reading for myself since they're smaller and lighter and easier price wise to replace than my iPad. Just a forewarning, the kindle store can be a little wonky and less streamlined in aligning purchases. I wish there was a restore purchases button like in the Apple Store since I've bought stuff in games to have the content disappear... I'm sure if I were less lazy I could call customer support though :)
A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine.
Gave this as a Christmas gift & they loved it. I had to buy a couple more!
I live these. Slowly replacing dots in our large rooms with echos. The sound quality is close to a nose system
This was bought as a Christmas present for my other half. She is enjoying it very much and it is user friendly
Bought for my husbands birthday and am very impressed!
Very nice tablet for the price. Fast and responsive
If you like reading books this will make an awesome companion on your next vacation. The backlight is great too. You can read in complete darkness even if someone else is sleeping in the same room. I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It was one of the rare good gift ideas I've come up with :)
This was my first time being introduced to the Fire Stick TV and it is awesome with all its features and ability to add multiple applications. 2 thumbs Up!!
I got this for my birthday and I love it. I love the resolution, size and blue light setting. I am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a Christmas present, I only need to buy a sleeve.
Goo graphics and easy to use. Does much more than you think. A perfect gift.
We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product.
The Best Buy salesman told us "you can take it anywhere and it will play for hours" true, if you buy a separate battery.
I bought this for my niece and she loves it. Works great.
syncing issue, but once resolved alexa works fine! becareful not to say alexa or echo too loud if you don't want her to answer. make sure your question is clear. the response is immediate- it is amazing and freaky! now we really don't have to recall anything because we can ask alexa.
This is a great starters tablet. Easy to use and compact.
Gift for my sister and she is loving it!! Would definitely consider getting one for myself.
Good platform, easy to use although a keyboard might prove more helpful that having to ask Alexa.
Great as long as your expectations are in line with cost. A little slow but totally usable.
This tablet uses the Amazon version of the Android operating system. Not all apps and functions are available for use on this device. Tablet is reasonably fast and responsive. Screen is sharp and bright with a wide viewing angle. Speaker is minimal and lacks fidelity - external bluetooth speaker (not included) or hard wired audio system(not included) work well . Bluetooth works well. WiFi (N) works well. Both cameras are weak and grainy. Check to make sure the apps you want to use are available and also check to make sure they work well.
Does a good job of performing basic functions and provides a good amount of entertainment. Good for watching movies or playing simple games or performing simple tasks. Looks good. Seems like it is well made and of good quality materials. Have not had any problems. Battery life is great for the price. Amazon sells a quality product.
Good product.........................................................
My father was visiting and broke his tablet and I able able to pick this up in the store the same day.
I bought this not really knowing any Amazon products and I gotta say.... it has become one of my top 5 gadgets! It's aweomse!!!!!!!! I've made my sisters get one too!!!!!
I purchased this tablet as a Christmas gift for my son along with the amazon fire 7 case. The tablet has a neat kid free time feature that you can use to limit time spent on tablet and control web sites viewed. The features are great but a little time is needed to enable these features. Over all four stars/ 5 if it was easier to use and didn't have to much advertising on locked screen.
The Echo is a nice and quick addition to finding weather forecasts & sport's scores. Also, we use-it daily for serving as our radio.
Can download games without using phone plan data. Games that my boys enjoy
Bought the paperwhite as a gift for my son. He wanted it for reading as he did not need all of the other apps found on the other Kindle products. He really likes it.
This was perfect for my 11 year old to take on our trip cross country.
This is a great little Tablet for the price. Easy to use.
It is a great tool to have I like playing my music on command or setting a timer for something cooking. Plus small enough to keep on your counter.
Looking for a present for that young professional or graduate, this is great. They love technology.
This thing is great! It connects to everything! Thank you Best Buy!
Nice kids tablet for a decent price. I bought it for a road trip.
Great for reading, watching movies, using on the go
I love that it has a clear picture and great volume.
We love our amazon Fire TV's, this is our second one and we use them with netflix and hulu and our amazon prime video accounts, they work fantastically and we decided to stop paying for cable as theres usually nothing good on when we want to watch t.v. anyway!
If you know of someone that would like to view videos or play smaller games, then this is a great product for them. This is more like an entry level tablet.
very good for kids to use, play games and watch kids videos.
This was a birthday gift for my grandson. He loves it.
I used a lot of different streaming boxes over the years I've never had a lot of success with them until now these Amazon boxes are extremely well built and provide excellent content
Great price for this tablet my kids love it and we haven't had any problems with it.
Must have if you like to read on a tablet. Easy to carry and read.
Got this for my grandson 7 yrs old - perfect size.
Product is great. Highly recommended and extremely easy to all around the house/office.
Easy to navigate, love the features! Just wish the price was lower!
I'm an android developer, and as such have owned and operated maybe 20 android devices and 10 iOS devices in the last five years. Honestly, the Fire is a bit faster and more stable than many tablets 2-3x its price. I find the UI a bit cluttered- it takes a fair amount of swiping to get where I want, and the home screens stretch on a bit with the default arrangement- but its a wonderful way to read books, check the internet, and do general web browsing. And since its a major name brand tablet , its very easy to find screen protectors and cases at even five below, which fit it perfectly. Too many cheap tablets are such a small, specialized item that you'll never be able to find replacement parts or matching cases. Overall, one of my three favorite devices out of 30 or so.
The echo has a great sound for a small product. The convenience alone makes this a worthwhile purchase.
Amazing tablet does everything I need it to do wow!
Got this for Christmas gifts for a few people and each say they love this tablet . For the price it's great .
Delivery is super fast, and the product seems nice.
Purchased for my mom and she said it was very easy to use.
Not to big, not to small. Just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. I bought this to go with my Amazon Prime membership. Popped in a 128 Gb mini sd card for plenty of storage.
Can't play word games or monopoly but other than that great
Very happy with this "basic" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a "paperwhite"), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem.
The Kindle fire is very easy to use for anyone of any skill type with technology.
Better than trying to listen to our favorite music on the radio! Speakers are great and will connect wireless speakers soon.Should have purchased this earlier. Will purchase another Echo Dot for another room. GREAT Concept!!
I bought 4 then 2 more. Great beginner tablet and great price.
This is a very good tablet for use with streaming. It does lack some apps like youtube however, since it isn't connected to the google play store. If you are an amazon prime member this is an extremely good buy since you can easily access all of your prime benefits right from the home screen.
Purchased this for my 7 year old grandson. He loves it and easy to use.
This is the 3rd Paperwhite I've purchased... for me and as gifts. Absolutely love them!
Love my new Amazon Fire Tablet! Love to read and this was perfect for me!
This is a low cost item that provides huge returns for the money spent. It is a great little tablet.
I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite and it is really great. No glare, keeps power for a very long time, and lightweight. I love it.
Works as advertised. Will be interesting to see that additional apps that Amazon rolls out for the Fire device.
Wonderful, it is for a toddler and a four year old, also a seven year old boy.They love it. A lot of the games I put on are educational.The toddler and the four year old like the puzzles and ballon poppingGames. The seven year old likes thinking games, so they are all happy.So am I.
The downside is everytime I open up the tablet, there is an advertisement. I would prefer not to see these. Font is changeable, brightness is adjustable.
Great tablet for kids but you have to keep your eye on them to protect them
Decided to try the Amazon Fire to replace our cable TV. Since I'm already an Amazon Prime member for other reasons, this was only a one-time expense for me. It was a very good choice - the Amazon Fire has given me the flexibility to watch what I want to watch and when without having to record and monitor what I record on the DVR. With the Amazon Fire I'm in control and not the cable company Even with adding Hulu & Sling, I'm still saving $100 each month!
My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
I bought it for 34 $ during thanks giving. This is average product. I would suggest to go for Fire HD.
battery seems to die fast, but that is my only complaint.
The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets.
This is an excellent product - speaker quality is amazing.
Bought two...one for each kid for Christmas. Perfect for the kids. Download their shows and music. Keeps them off ours. Durable enough for them to use on their own.
This is so much faster than the fire stick. It also provides full support for sling tv and PlayStation vue which Apple TV has not. This has replaced our Apple TV as the primary streamer.
I got this for my sister as a gift. So far so good. The price was just right.
Love, Love, Love, my hubby absolutely loves his new Kindle fire. Great picture and easy to use.
Haven't personally used this tablet but my niece likes it.
Picked this up to keep the book reading and main tablet games on different devices. Been working good so far for the whole family.
Works well. Easy to install. Great features include Alexa, connection to Amazon, Netflix, movies I can't find elsewhere, music, and more
This device has a lot of good features. Once you pay for Amazon prime your able too watch a multitude of movies.
Does what it said on the fire tv. Not a bad Device.
I bought it for my cousin and she loves it. Nice and simple.
I decided I need a device dedicated to my Amazon account so I purchased this. I have been using my iphone and ipad but wanted to have a device specifically for books. I've had kindles before and the products are so good.
I love this I have bout three of these for my grand children and one of the wind up getting a different tablet and I was able to keep it for myself instead of returning and i just love it, It was confusing figuring out how to download on it but one of my grandchildren figured it out for me.
My wife loves it
I was glad I got it for my husband for Christmas. He play's games on it.
Very limited. Have activate skills.. a little bit of a pain. Otherwise fun to mess with her. Will learn as we go. Have used go control lights and other. Works ok.
Great product. No issues. I recommend it for all users
It is easy to see and adjust font style and size. Great for reading at night.
Received as Christmas gift and I love the size and features of the kindle.
Wife loves this Kindle as opposed to some of the others due to readability in bright light.
My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on.
I've done everything with Alexa from Pandora, the Nest thermostat and iheart. Getting one more for when we go to El Salvador.
I own three Amazon Echos: one at home and one each at 2 vacation homes. I use them mostly for grocery and to-do lists, weather, and music. We have also given four as gifts.
Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use
Bought this for my 3 yr old grandson...very kid friendly & he loves it
Nice and light. Does not have as good of battery as advertised but still very nice.
This was a Christmas gift for mother and she loves it because it allows her to play game and read instead of using her phone which is much smaller.
My new Kindle DX2 graphite came yesterday and immediately I realized I needed a cover. I was nervous when putting the DX down and picking it up fearing that I would drop or scratch it and there's no great way to carry the Kindle around without a cover. Also I found the bare Kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and I was hoping a cover would give me a better grip.This cover was just released and I like the fact that it has the elastic band to hold it closed like the original Kindle 1, as I had read that the older DX cover did not always stay closed. I got the cover with 1-day local delivery and it just arrived.The cover weighs a bit more than 11 ounces so the Kindle with cover is 30 ounces. This makes it significantly heavier than just the Kindle alone (18.75 oz), however the cover gives you several better ways to hold the Kindle, including open like a book or folded back. If you rest the Kindle on something to take the weight off, it is definitely more comfortable to read with it. My preference is to lie on the couch with the Kindle balanced on my chest/stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the cover open at about 90 degrees.I'd give it 5 stars if it was lighter, but so far I really like it.
This is my second Echo. If you have a smart home, you need thus. It's the brains.
I was surprised with the quality of this product and although is true it doesn't have as many apps as Roku is still excellent.
I replaced my old Kindle with this one. The pull out light on the old one had been damaged by my grand son. This Kindle is so much smaller, lighter and the lighting makes it much easier to read. I got the cover that makes it look like a small notepad since I was traveling to Guatemala.
I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools.
does everything and more...very easy to operate and set up...
I bought five of these for ages 4 to 14. They all loved them and were up and using them within 5 minutes. Was their favorite gift!!!
I literally use this thing every single day. Love it.
this thing has everything. i bought the box because it is way faster that the stick
I enjoy my alexa I just have to talk to her and she also keeps me connected with my family
very easy set up and no issues with it starting to work. going to get proper light switches so it can turn my lights on and off
I have several of these, one for everyone in the family. Very inexpensive and everyone is happy.
Really good quality piece and would strongly recommend
Great tablet for kids! Both of my children love it!
I really enjoy it love the sound and it's really easy
If you're willing to experiment, this could be really awesome
We bought 3 of these both our sons and our granddaughter LOVE then easy to operate so far no glitches sturdy and not so expensive I have to worry about the kids breaking them and not being able to replace
I originally bought a regular tablet to read my Ebooks but my tablets battery drained to fast and is kind of cumbersome. On a whim I decided to give the paperwhite a go and I love it. It's glarefree the battery lasts for three weeks and I like being able to highlight a characters name in a novel and get background info on who it is.
The Fire Tablet has an Android operating system but is not like using an Android phone. Amazon's software makes the tablet more cumbersome to use and the tablet will often freeze. Also, you cannot download Apps from Google Play you have to get them from the Amazon App Store. There are several Apps from Amazon that you cannot remove even if you do not use them. Would not recommend without having Amazon Support.
Kindle Fire continues to be my fav device to keep in touch with family and friends...internet, Facebook, messenger, email, movies, books, music...does it all. I'm never bored!!
My daughter is really enjoying her new Kindle that was purchased as a Christmas present.
Okay, glad it holds alot of books, wish it had send & received email.
The echo and Alexa are fun to use, convenient, and way more useful than I thought initially. She is the best roommate ever. She does whatever i ask and doesn't complain about my choices of music.
we have enjoyed using this from the day that we purchased it. It is not only useful for everyday, but is a wonderful addition to any party setting.
The Echo is a great device. The on;y drawback is sometimes Alexa doesn't understand your question. Other that, it's great. And with the Amazon music, it plays all of the Amazon music. You couldn't ask for anything else. It even plays comedy bits, too.
can not do without my kindle fire.I had an earlier model 4 years ago.it is still going , just wanted a backup.
performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars
I set up the fire and Alexa automatically downloaded and that was good, unexpected. I use it daily for news, sports, and some business research. The home screen is a little much at times and I thought it would be fine but I think I would like 16 gig instead of 8 but I can just pop in extra memory.
I would recommend this product. It works great and ver compact.
My wife purchased this for my birthday and we find it to be VERY helpful. Very easy to use. Perfect size to be placed conspicuously in the home. It's an all-around great tool for parties, up-to-date info every morning, list keeping, calendar maintenance and general fact checking. We love it!
I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.
About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good
This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it..
Was looking for something for my son to play games on while traveling and this was very inexpensive and great quality. The charger is not nearly as long as it needs to be but otherwise it is a great product.
Great product, it streams fast and is a good replacement from high cable bill
i really like my fire it has a nice picture and is easy to operate
this is easy to setup even for the wife. 9 year old son is a wiz at this already.
Excellent item I just bay it from Best bay ita very good for the kids
As time goes on I learn more ways to use the Echo.
A nice update to the original 5W USB Power Adapter. Despite how wonderful the 9W USB Power Adapter is for Kindle Fires, I still actually prefer to use this oldie but goodie due to the way the 9W folds. I actually prefer not to have the pointy bits (lack of a better term) fold away as this causes problems when trying to connect it to something new. I actually prefer this to charging my Kindle Fire faster as the 5W is really for the regular E Ink Kindles like my Kindle Voyager.Now the 9W is fine for traveling and if you leave the charger plugged in. But this new sleek and black and white charger works and turns heads with a white or black cord depending on if you still have those old white cords laying about.
I bought this as a gift, and we all tried it out. Setup was pretty easy - download the app, connect it to your wi-fi, and you're off and running from there. Some of the potentially useful things that we saw right off the bat were:* Reading your news headlines in the morning* It feels like a voice-oriented Google search* Getting answers to random questions* Kids are easily entertained by itPersonally, I don't see the need for it - but I can appreciate the convenience and novelty of it.
Serves it's purpose. Pretty neat features, I like it.
this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games
Alexa works great. Very easy to use and speaker sounds awesome.
Perfect for streaming movies and tv shows that aren't offered on regular cable
Very ha day Very handy to have this plug I will use it what was that Very handy to have this plug will keep it as a as a extra extra one so that I can so that if I lose I lose the other plug I will have this one
Light weight easy to take with u . From reading to Facebook for all your little needs
If you are someone who enjoys reading for long periods of time, then you will really like the Kindle Paperwhite. The battery life is phenomenal, usually only requiring charging once every 7-10 days with daily reading. The text is very crisp and clear. The backlight is nice for reading in the dark, however you will note a little uneven lighting and a 'ghost' effect of text at times in the background. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who reads for long periods of time.
can't beat the price on this great starter tablet. purchase this as a gift. many happy hours of use by recipient.
Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
Amazon hit the mark with this product ! Good voice and sound quality
This echo does just about anything, just ask her and she has the answer. She works together with my harmony remote perfectly. Cant wait to link her to my hue lights !!
I am very happy with this tablet. My kids spends hours of hours on this neat device.
Very easy to use. A high quality apple product. Good tech!
Took me a few times to get used to it and now I love this Kindle!
I bought the fire 7 inch last year and this one is better.
Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it's used.
I bought this tablet originally for my kids but I loved it so much I had to purchase one for myself. Love it!!
I bought this tablet for my son. It's the perfect size for him. It does everything any tablet, or smartphone (minus calling/texting) can do. And you can't beat the price for a name brand tablet.
Satisfied with tablet, especially for the price. Christmas gift for a middle school kid. It worked out.
The best gift for someone and you could download a lot of games
Love it easy to use just talk and your song or movie comes up
This tablet is inexpensive and user friendly for my toddler. He loves it and uses great educational apps.
So far it has done exactly what I want it to do. It is much faster than the fire stick
Connects to anything lights, cameras if you have amazon prime there unlimited music
It is ok to be a "android" tablet with such a low price. But the display is not good as they described.It hurts my eyes after long use.
I like it because it's like using a firestick but you're able to hook it up through the Ethernet cable so you don't have to worry about lag.
I love how much this tablet can do. It fits in my purse perfectly.
How about this for my uncle as a present and he loves it
This is GREAT for my 3 year old and my 5 year old! They stay entertained and easy to use.
I bought this for my brother-in-law. He is not a techie but had someone set it up for him. He loves it
Old kindle broke. I love the improvements of the paperwhite. It is all touch screen. The old was not.
Item is good. This shipping is very fast. It's good for readers.
We're just setting it up now. There is a lot of sinking different apps to Alexa. Doesn't seem to bad though.
Amazon has a great way of stream-lining their platform, operating system, and design style all within this 1 tablet; great product!
Great tool to have around the house! Like a personal assistant at your finger tips!
Its great .................................................
Very ideal for viewing movies, and th selections very updated!
I control everything and am having a blast. So cool
More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL.
This is a Christmas gift, but the reviews I have read on it are excellent.
When my kids play a game on their profile the system goes to the screensaver. My dad's doesn't do this so it may just be a software issue on mine. But altogether I do love having the Fire.
I bought this tablet mostly because the price was extremely affordable. I like that it's easy to use and set up easily to my Amazon account and all my books.
Item is as described and I have enjoyed the ease of use
Expected it to be a bigger version of the HDX but it was not. The email was bad and so was the calendar.
Great addition to our home entertainment setup. Connected up with HDMI and was working within minutes.
Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!
A nice size tablet for a technically challenged adult. Great for snapping pics, reading books and an occasional online search.
I love everything about the kindle fire but i would like a bigger screen
We were looking for a streaming option in 4K and this one works great. Great picture and sound!
I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
Easy to install and use. Easy set-up. Great for streaming entertainment. Definitely recommend.
After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.
I love the size and the well-lit screen. The words appear very crisp and easy to read!!!
We bought the echo and we really enjoy it. It is great for music and much more
I purchased this for my stepdaughter. well her dad and I are no longer together we divorced 2 yrs ago. Both her parents could not purchase this for her. So Merry Christmas little one. She loves it . Easy to learn great for pictures
We bought it last year Black Friday for us and now we bought it as a gift because it's good for kids
A great addition to my fledgling smart home. I can hardly wait to see what Alexa can do next!
I got this tablet to watch movies and stream Netflix and it does it flawlessly. The battery life is not very good but otherwise a great tablet for less than $50.
My niece loves this tablet. It's very durable, but charges slow
Love the Tap! Bought it as a gift and love the sound quality. For such a small speaker, it packs a big punch!
It was easy and simple to use. Fast and responsive.
Very easy to use but lags bad. Would recommend the box.
at first i bought this because i was tired of carrying heavy cookbooks but turns out its better suited for more novel-type books. i realized that cookbooks need to be 'flippable' -where i can just sit and flip back and forth. however this is great if you have long flights often- light and easy on the eyes. i love being able to change the brightness easily
I brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it. She is able to download all of her games and apps that she uses to have on the iPad.
My daughter enjoy playing games and watching learning programs on device. Love the ability to secure adult information from kids by using a password.
Purchased for 4 yr old granddaughter who primarily uses for Netflix. Works great!
We enjoy this device because it allows out tv to have smart tv features.
Really like this tablet. It's easy to navigate and use.
Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase.
Present for my husband. He is enjoying trivia questions
I asked for a roku4 for Christmas but got Amazon Fire instead. I've never had either one but so far I really like Amazon Fire. I just wanted something faster than my DVD player that takes too long to update and this has been perfect.
My son loves his kindle fire tablet. It is perfect
I wish I purchased the warranty, this kindle is glitchy and pixelly (if that's even a term) and also freezes
Bought it for tbe grandson to play games on. It is ok for that. I have had Nook tablets before and I think tbey are a little better than the Amazon. It does fine for what we bought it for.
Love this device for reading. I travel for a living so it's great not carrying a bulky book with me. Plus doesnt bother my eyes after reading for hours
I bought about 5 tablets before. This is the best tablets I ever bought.
I bought this in thanksgiving day. It's good for the price !!
a lot of the times Alexa will come back and say I don't understand the question get very annoying
Bought this to replace a nexus player and happily surprised how much smoother this box is. And Comcast allows more apps to be installed on Amazon firetv devices than androidtv devices for some reason, so definitely a plus.
The Amazon echo works really great and it works well with smart programs.
Works great however , She is only as smart as you make her. A lot of work to be done !
I got this as a Christmas gift for my son and he has really enjoyed it.
Wow this tablet for the price of 40$ at the time what a value. Works very well, easy to use, great for beginners.
Replacement tablet for my wife - no complaints! She watches Netflix on it a lot.
The ease of Alexa in performing functions is second to none. SIRI who?
My husband, kids and I have enjoy Alexa very much. Having her play music without us lifting a finger is my daughter's favorite feature.
This tablet has been perfect for my son. I actually bought 3 and my kids love it. The amazon app store has tons of free games for kids (panda, toca, etc.) my kids are 4, 5 and 10. In my opinion best cheap tablet for a family on the go. Screen is good for kids, seen no lag in performance also. Not sure about camera they never use it.
This is my third Kindle, plus I have used the Kindle app on my two iPads and three iPhones. I always want to have a real Kindle so I will read in peace and avoid distraction from email, texts and such.This is much more readable that all of the previous models. The resolution is as good as I could ever want. The lighting is perfectly even and makes reading in any light (or lack of) completely comfortable. The screen response is almost perfect, but I am just getting use to the new side areas to turn pages. I love the weight and can read in any position, including on my back in bed, with one hand.I am perfectly fine with paying $200 for this Kindle. If you want something to read your books, and nothing else, this is the product for you.
We use this on a daily basis, a nice upgrade from the fire stick!
Tablets are easy for setting up, & using. Thank you.
This is a great tablet for the money. Runs fast and works seamlessly with Amazon Prime membership. Prime is not required to use this by the way. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a tablet for entertainment. We havent tried to use this for business purposes though.
This little speaker is way better that her mother. after that update making it hand free, i recommend to anyone.
Great for my 7 year old son. Has all his games and favorites apps installed. Easy navigation user friendly.
My son just loves his Fire tablet. Easy for him to setup to his liking. Can't beat the price either. At the time of the review it was $34.99. If you have kids, this makes a great gift for them.
A nice upgrade from my original Amazon TV Fire.The voice command feature has been flawless.A great purchase.
Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price
I'm liking this tablet more and more, the more I use it. Great battery life. Easy to use.
What can I say about the plug....it is great. Now I have the option of using the plug to charge my Apple ipod or using my USB cord and adapter that charges my pod directly into the wall port. I do prefer the plug though.
Great for my 8 year old she loves it. She got it for christmas and plays with it everyday.
great tablet does it all you don't have to break the bank on an expensive one this is perfect
This was a perfect gift for the holidays! I saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!
The amazon echo is great. It has amazing sound. I like the ability it can be operated from your phone, online, and by voice control.
Bought for my 3 year old. Very rugged and easy to use. Love it uses the android apps and kiddo loves it.
This product is significantly improved over my previously owned first generation Kindle and first generation Fire. The resolution is better, the programmable features are more numerous and the response is quicker.
Bought these for my kids and they love them. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth compatible.
This is the best device for streaming very fast....
Unfortunately, the first time I plugged the Tablet in to charge it up, the battery overheated and shorted out the tablet. I returned it to Best Buy for a full refund with no hassles.
Awesome product like the layout used Roku in the past I really like this one way more than the Roku
This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there.
Alexa has become an integral family member. Love her!
Love love love my kindle fire. Had the original and then bought and iPad then bought this kindle and I am wondering why I even bought the iPad. Will not switch again. I will stick with my kindle.
My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did.
Portability is important to me. Really like the ease in using the echo.
The best streaming device on the market right now. Don't waste you money on anything else
My son bought this and he loves it. And it's cheap!
Replacing older reader without a light and traveling overseas soon. With electronics in the cabin under scrutiny, this very small and very lightweight reader fits the bill! Perfect in small purses and large pockets. I can read without annoying seatmate with cabin overhead seat light. Easy to hold in either hand and screen adjusts for whichever direction you're holding it.
I own an Nvidia Shield, which is the current Hulk of Android Tv. The Fire TV handles media heavy lifting with the same precision.
Ok several good features, just wish camera was better
My computer crashed and I bought this tablet to get me by during repairs. The tablet allowed me to keep up with my e-mails and events. I used it to surf the internet as well. It will be used for similar purposes when my wife and I go on a three week road trip in the near future. A very compact and versatile unit.
The Amazon Fire is perfect for my son. He loves to play games and the app store is easy to use!
Bought this kindle for my aging mother! It is our third. She loves it! My daughter loves hers as well! Easy to use...even for someone in their 80's!
Great charger. Somewhat pricey however. If you attatch it to the cable that comes with the e-book reader, this allows you to plug it into a wall socket.
Found this device to be one of the best streamers on the market with Ethernet. Also have an Apple 3rd generation and enjoy this more because of the availability of apps that I cannot get on the Apple device (Amazon Prime, PlayStation Vue).
My daughter loves her Kindle Fire. Easy to setup parental controls.
This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen.
If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.
Christmas gift for my wife who has regular Kindle and an Ipad mini.This has become her goto medium for ebooks.
Great product simple easy to understand great value!!!!
Love this gift for my dad he couldn't get it charged fast enough to play his poker games! Great price & so worth his smile on his face!
Love it, take it with me everywhere, Not all of us are computer/technical savvy. Need better written, printable instructions on how to use. Step 1, step 2, etc.
I have always enjoyed my kindles. easy to carry and read.
Gave one of these to my sister for Christmas, who then RAVED about it. She said it was awesome. So I got one. I'm happy with it and I even got the remote, too.I especially like being able to tell it to add things to the shopping list/to-do list. In addition, I get a daily news briefing and get the best commute route for the morning.
Great new device for the whole family. We added HUE lights and Nest camera.
Purchased as a gift, the recipient is very happy and surprised with the performance, thinking of buying another one for myself.
Purchased as a chrismas gift. receipent was very happy with the present.
light and compact and a little slow with the apps and images
The Echo has been a smash hit. It works well with devices and is easy to set up. The access and use is very simple. My son is taking it to college with him and he loves it.
Very happy that I decided to upgrade to the paperwhite version of the Kindle. Now I can see what I am reading. It was very difficult with the original Kindle that I received as a gift.
I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it ever since. Echo is a way to go.
This is a great media device. Mostly use it for XBMC/KODI but has plenty of power for other functions
I have been and Apple TV guy from the start but was disappointed they chose not to include 4K on there latest model. So I thought I would see what Amazon had to offer. Wow the 4K content available is awesome and growing everyday. All the menu's are easy to use and set up. Very, very, happy with this purchase.
The more I use it the more it learns caught this on sale and have not been disappointed
Easy set up. Great features. Can't beat the price.
Good product and will definitely share to all my friends
Got one for my nephew... very easy setup and has a ton of games to download!
The Amazon Fire Tv has worked great for us! Super easy set up!
Love my Kindle Voyage. The size is much smaller than my older Kindle and the weight is much less. This helps as I take fm Kindle everywhere. Love the touch screen features.
The amazon echo is a fun and easy to use device. Sound quality for music is excellent and Alexa answers questions easily. Definitely a must have if you subscribe to prime as you have lots of music choices. Highly recommend the echo.
Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn't great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend.
Great for reading books, backlight is useful. Love being able to get library books on it. Not sure I'm a fan of the ads when the unit is asleep though..
I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit.
Love it!! My two year old loves to watch Sesame Street & football
Great item and love shopping at Best Buy. I buy all my electronic there for everyone in my house.
I bought the Fire in hopes to play movies from my ultraviolet account. Only to find out that it no longer supports ultraviolet format on the Fire. So, I had to shop elsewhere to play movies for my plane trips. Don't buy if you're looking to play movies this way!
Needed something smaller than my Samsung 10 inch tablet to carry around and this worked great.
Alexa is a blast and a lot of fun. Voice recognition works well and the microphone picks up speech at quite a distance. I also purchased a dot. Boy have decent sound quality.
Bought this as my nephews first tablet. He loves it, and it's still in one piece! Worth my $!
I have bought 3 of these tablets for my great grand children. excellent for learning and u don't use data.
Already own 2 Roku's. Purchased 2 Fire TV's and found the performance and usability very good. Replaced Cable TV withe them parred with PlayStation Vue Core Slim. The menu system/DVR is as good if not better than Cable. Mix that with a Tivo interface and Netflix, it is a game changer.
The Amazon Echo is really a great device - very easy to setup and super cool to use.
No matter what I asked, either Alexa didn't know the answer, or offered to order an item that I didn't ask for, with a prime membership.Couldn't even get my weather forecast right.Kept giving me the forcast for an area 20 miles away.I returned it.By the way, whatever I ask for from" ok Google" I get an answer that is usually 99% correct.Never asks me to pay for a $99 membership or offer to order something online for me.Don't need it. Don't want it.
The amazing Amazon echo. That is the perfect heading for the speaker. Actually it's far more than the speaker, this may be one of the best purchases I've ever made. I use it to order an Uber, to order pizza, to look up recipes and to buy things on Amazon simply a genius product.
I purchased this tablet for my 4 yr old daughter and it's been outstanding!!! With separate parent controls makes it a breeze to keep kids away from unwanted sites!
This is the 3rd Kindle Fire I have bought. This one was a present for my nephew. I love the Fire tablets, the graphics and picture quality is great. Amazon offers many of the same high quality apps as Apple. I actually have an iPad too but would rather play on my Fire tablet. I have used my Fire tablets in classes, read magazines and books, and watch TV shows and movies for free as I have Amazon Prime.
I realize that many people will believe that this product is a cynical attempt to pump up Amazon's profits, and I'm sure it contributes, but don't deny yourself the serious fun this device will bring into your home!We originally bought this as a gift for my seeing-impaired mother-in-law in order for her to enjoy trivia, music and audio books with a hands-free interface. We didn't anticipate enjoying it ourselves so much that I'm not sure we're going to be willing to let it go!!!Setup is dead simple if you already have an Amazon Prime account and wireless Internet access. The audio quality and the unit's ability to cut through ambient noise in order to hear you are remarkable. The device is solidly built and has several nice ergonomic touches such as the rotating, color changing ring of lights that let you know you are being heard to the rotating volume ring at the top of the unit.It is amazing what the Echo can do. I'll leave the voyage of discovery up to each of you. Do get used to hearing "Hmmm, I'm not sure about that" or "I'm still learning about...." but I am certain that the Echo's cloud based "brain" will only get better with time.Do yourself a favor and get one of these, the whole family will enjoy it!
Purchased the tablet as a gift for my mom and she loves it!
Recommended great electronic. Great for birthday or Christmas
I really like this product. I love all the apps. I love the Alexa feature that works with the remote. There are options to mod this as well to do more. Better than an Apple TV. Similar to a Roku.
I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card.
Didn't know that Amazon had control over everything. Should have bought any other tablet.
Up front I want to say that I actually returned the Echo in lieu of the Amazon Dot. They are both basically the same device but I did not need the extra powerful bluetooth speaker portion of it as I already have a great speaker at home which I hooked up to the dot and it works amazing. If you dont already have a bluetooth speaker, get the Echo, keep it simple, neat and its a great omnidirectional speaker. I am still amazed at how much power these little devices hold. I learn new ways to interact with Alexa every week and it makes my life easier and more entertaining. I highly recommend this in your home if you have kids, my 3 year old daughter now spends time asking Alexa questions when I am not available.
The Paperwhite makes it possible to condense a lot of books in one small device, thereby saving your house from looking like a warehouse. You can pack a lot of books into your suitcase with a Paperwhite. If your device gets stolen, lost or trashed, you may lose a substantial portion (or all) of your personal library. The Paper white allows you to increase size of print Big Advantage. Use of hand gestures to turn page allows faster reading. It's awkward to hold, lying in bed. An attachable gripper would be helpful to hold and read at same time
This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
The Amazon Echo has been an amazing and also somewhat frustrating experience. The convenience it brings with timers, turning on connected lights, playing music, and just corny jokes is amazing. I love this machine but it also does become a little frustrating when it doesn't work immediately. In the time I've had it, it has mostly worked on the first try but there are definitely days when the lights won't all turn on when asked. Sometimes it takes a long time for Alexa to respond to the commands (Could be an internet issue, but still detracts from the experience). All in all, it is an awesome device and I have enjoyed it immensely.
Really neat tool. We bought it for a neighbor and he is excited to have it.
Good set of apps available and it is robust enough for the kids to abuse.
Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
I purchased this tablet when it was on sale for black Friday. Overall it works great. Can't beat the price.
Love this! Alexa is so cool you feel like you're living in the jettsons
Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader.
Great gift for a son who has everything and loves technology. His children love asking it questions.
If you like the Amazon Echo and want it to be portable, this is the solution. The stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is. The built in Alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized (and priced) portable speakers.
Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..
Kindle is perfect for reading, this white version is really attractive to me
Love it, the tablet is nice lightweight you can use it everywhere!
This is my second Kindle Paperwhite. My first Kindle died (I believe it was old age as cause of death) and the next day I went out and purchased a replacement. So easy to set up and there were all my books. The Paperwhite is so easy on your eyes and love that you can adjust the font to any size that's comfortable. Can be used with dim lighting or no lighting at all. Great for reading in bed.
my daughter cant put this thing down, so it's doing what it's supposed to do.
So far so good. Having an issue with one of them freezing. Might have to use it
One of the best items I have ever purchased.. The fun never ends with the amazon echo
Can't beat the price on this Fire Tablet HD8! Very good display.
Adjustable backlights are much nicer than clip on light.
I played Pandora music station on my Echo with Kevin Spacey singing along with other great artist.
I was looking for something new to use to read with and this was a good choice. Easy to navigate, multi functional and great color!
This tablet is great for the price. We ended up purchasing 6 of them. It is great for the kids and is very functional. I think the price helped lower my stress level where the kids are concerned, but it is very sturdy. Would purchase again.
It's just what I wanted! I love that I can listen to what I want without using my phone
Amazing flexibility and range of available apps (over 2,000!) for this product. My daughter loves it!!
Amazon's devices get better and better each release. I've had the original Kindle fire and it's in no way an Apple iPad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. It's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. The price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use.
I love this it was the best thing I brought My kids even love it and it easy for or them to use
Echo is not only fun but a valuable tool. It saves time in getting weather, daily news, my calendar appointments, etc.
Love the sound that comes out and Alexa is very informative!
This replaced my dish/cable. Soooo many apps to choose from. Speaking into the remote is a HUGE plus. Ease of use is 2nd to none. I also bought a fruit TV, and this is hands down better.
Purchased this device for my son and really enjoyed it. Ended up buying another after a day of using the device.Pros:- Fast boot time- Clear & sharp display- Long battery life- Light weightCons:- Adds on lock screen- Inability to remove apps from the home screen (Can only move them to a folder)- Screen shows more fingerprints then say an Ipad or Nexus deviceOverall this has been a great device and hasnt had any issues. I play Game of War on the device and watch Hulu/Netflix for the majority of my use. For an Ebook is it smaller but does the job.
Bought this for my grandniece, keeps her entertained. Can't beat the price.
I bought one Fire TV just to test out "cutting the cable" and start streaming TV. I was so impressed with Amazon's Fire TV that I bought a second one for the bedroom. Small, easy to setup, full featured and fast.
Alexa can definitely be useful with creating shipping lists, entertaining guests, and integrating into a smart home. If you have young children it can be a little frustrating as they tend to compete for controlling the device and there is no way to have Alexa ignore a command given to it.Specialty command lines can be confusing if you don't get the studying right.Overall, it is useful for most things and the music services it connects to allow for a wide variety of entertainment.
I needed to upgrade my electronics since I haven't bought a tablet in a couple of years. What I had at home wouldn't stream what I wanted to see. I went in looking for a 10in and came out with this 8in after the sales assoc. showed me its features & answered my questions. Much more portable than a 10in would have been too.
.Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet
What can I say about a charger adapter. It works great.
Great iream i use it kodi and runs great easy to install.
Works good for my grandkids to play with when they are visiting me at my home.. I really needed to buy 3 instead of 2. Only gripe I have is the seemingly "forced" ads popping up, which appear to be built into it. Maybe I will learn someday how to stop them. :(
Good quality touch compared to other low priced tabs .. Poor on apps .Good for children to play around.
It is convenient, great size and efficient easy to use
I was a great price for a tablet! I would buy this tablet again.
Hey man who was the only way to the next few days ago by the way to get the latest version of this message has a lot more than just the right now
I recently purchased this tablet as a backup to my IPad. I find myself using it as much as my more expensive tablet!!!
Love my Fire TV box (along with two other Fire TV sticks) and downloaded Playstation Vue to watch TV and sports channels at half the cost of my monthly cable and past satellite TV bills.
The Amazon tablet is great it's been working fine for me and I recommend it to anyone
I am no longer sitting alone in the basement watching Netflix using the kid's Xbox connection. I can watch Netflix upstairs and still remain somewhat involved in what the rest of the family is doing!
It is a good buy for the price and the performance is also awesome
Even though I'm an apple lover, I've turned to the firestick and fire tv for internet access on 4 tv's in my house. Very happy with the ease of set up and the performance.
Good deal on this product. We have several friends that have this and we love to play when we are at their houses
I use an Iphone but I needed a reliable Android machine to play many android games I've purchased. This fits the bill and runs Android fairly well for the price. Don't expect to push TOO much power out of this model but with some clever tweaking you can get this thing to bypass the Fire OS and do all your Android app needs.
It's a really good thing to have a round the house
The tablet is just the right size. The games are fun and has so many other uses
I truly love how I can just talk to her and ask for what I want. I got friends and family members wanting one.
I was not sure how much we would actually use the echo, but to my delight, we use it all the time. I love that it is so easy to use and I seem to find more and more that I use it for.
It's a great tablet. Does everything you need from a table and for only $50
Purchased this is a gift for a 7 year old and 13 year old. They both love the tab. They can play their games, surf the web and most importantly, read books!!! For the price you can't beat this tablet. Well done Amazon.
Purchased this kindle for a friend and they absolutely enjoy it.
I purchased this for my child and it is very durable. She can read, play games and watch Netflix for kids. No complaints here.
I reviewed a lot of tablets before I bought this one. It is the first one I have ever purchased. I am no tech geek and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. I mostly bought it for and use it for: reading e-mail, facebook, and browsing the internet. I really like it and use it more than my laptop. But, if I need to do anything detailed, I use my laptop. Overall it's a great tablet for a beginner, and you can't beat the price.
If you're getting this for a "Value Tablet" it is a great choice.Profile UI is lacking. My main reason for the tablet was to give my kids a tool to use ABC Mouse.They have to be logged into the parent account to even use it, so it defeats the purpose of having a kid profile.
I bought the Kindle White for my wife. She loves being able to read a book, without having to use wifi.
This was purchased for my 14 year old grand daughter and she loves it. The Kindle Fire does everything she needs it to do. We are very pleased.
Bought item to keep my grandma entertained. She uses it every day.
Easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. My daughter loves it.
Very easy to use and more reliable than cable tv. After set up by a friend it's all I use.
Good tablet for reading books and magazines. I like the tablet.
I bought this tablet for my mom for christmas. It was on sale, but is already at an inexpensive price to begin with. She is extremely happy with my gift. She is able to read and play games on a tablet with great speed. I might even buy my own!
The kids couldn't wait to turn them on and I'm very excited.
I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)
This was my first experience with amazon fire tv. Setup was simple and quick. Quality of movies was quite good. One of the best features was its integration with Slingbox. Now I can watch movies or my own content directly to my Samsung Tv. Great product.
Excellent for educational tool, during party and get together, with no pc available
Bought the tablet for my son and it works great love shopping at best buy for all of my electronic needs
Excellent product I use it for my kids all the time is great
Alexa is neat and once mastered many possibilities are opened.
Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.
Not so kid friendly. But it does what we need it and price is right.
Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.
I bought this for my mother. She loves it. She keeps it in her kitchen to listen to music, news, and audiobooks while she cooks and cleans. She has an Amazon Prime membership, so she has access to their large and diverse music library. She also listens to audiobooks that she's bought on Audible. The Echo can even be used as a timer for cooking!
We were tired of cable failure via mediacom and we're looking for a cables and dish less tv system. A friend of one of our friends told us about the fire system. We went out and bought it then purchased sling. We are very pleased with this decision.
Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
I m pleased with Echo disappointed that it came late
My second kindle. Paper white is really as good as old with advantage of being able to read in bed without needing extra light.
Cant answer as well as Amazon wish i had waited and bought Amazon
Bought it for my kids and they love it. They can't put it down
This has exceeded my expectation. The processor is quick.
It was a gift for my girlfriend. It is her first tablet. It was easy to get started and she uses it a lot.
It was a gift for someone so I don't know about it
super easy to use with great video quality, love it
This was a great buy as a first tablet for a child. Clear picture and easy to use.
It takes some practice to use all the functions of the echo. Additional components are expensive but all in all worth it.
I felt the system mived extremely slow not good for streaming great reader
Excellent product to be able to see thousands of free movies if you are a member of Amazon Prime.
Just learning all the features this product is capable of providing
it is a great streaming device with all the apps you need for streaming whatever it is you watch, cut the cable go to streaming it will save a lot of money
I love this Kindle 10, it is large enough to see very easily and very easy to handle when traveling. I love the size of it.
Having fun exploring the capabilities. The sound quality is great!
Use it every night to watch amazon television in bed, play games, read books. Great item.
Very happy with the Echo purchase!! Useful for whole family, very interactive and fun. Great for music/playlists and learning.
This radio was bought at and then installed at Best Buy. They did an awesome job and it works great.
My daughter loves this tablet. She drops it and it keeps going. she can't put it down.
Lots of fun! It plays music, games, weather, and so much more. However, when making a phone call or text message, I hope they develop a way to determine who is able to send you a text message or phone call and make it so that you can call anyone you so choose in United States not just those that have the app or device. I do feel that Google may have a better device because they have more advanced database. Sometimes Alexa does not understand what you were asking and you would think she would be able to know it. But it is fun however if I had to do it over again I would've probably purchased a Google because I can just tell that it will probably be able to do more then just play music.
Excellent product.I have purchased several ( yes, children can break them if they try ).I am sure there are limitations as it is an Amazon product ( -.5 stars) .My family does all they want with theirs, and are very happy (we have 4)..Mine is a year old and works like new.( I believe a previous model had an issue with the power cord they fixed )
Does what we need it to. Able to download apps that make it fun.
I NEEDED this as part of my SmartThings home automation system. I was waiting for a sale and got this when it was $50 off.It does everything that the manual said that it will do, works great.A bonus is that, alongst with using it to control my automation, I can also use it as a bluetooth speaker. And it sounds great.
I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
Alexa is great with the minor things like weather and music. I really enjoy how easy the set up is for other smart devises and the ease of operation.
It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.
I bought two of this at Christmas. Great for everyone in the family.
Far and away blows away the Echo Dot in terms of sound quality. The higher cost is offset by the need to purchase a decent quality bluetooth speaker for the Dot.
It was a gift to my daughter & she loves it!! From Fb to reading the bible online, she does everything on it!! The only down fall is the camera isn't that great but instead she just uses her iPhone bc she has bought at all times!!
Great tablet for the price! Very satisfied with the quality of tablet!
This has been a great addition to our family...haha! The kids love it. And for the price it can't be beat, maybe by the mini me version the Echo Dot.
The tablet convenient and the price is very reasonable. It is used daily for emailing, browsing, and game play.
I have had my Fire for 5 years at least and love it. Bought this for my mother. Her IPad died. She is enjoying it. Her only issue is there is a game she can't download because it is on Google play.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU GOT HOME FROM THE GROCERY STORE TO FIND OUT YOU FORGOT SOMETHING. THANKS TO ALEXA THAT DOESNT HAPPEN ANYMORE. NO PAPER LIST TO LOSE, NOT INTERUPTING WHAT YOUR DOING TO WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU NEED. JUST TELL ALEXA TO ADD IT TO YOUR LIST. NOT TO MENTION EVERYTHING ELSE SHE DOES.
Good Tablet for Kids, easy to operate and to handle.
We now have fire TV in every room of the house. Very user friendly.
I bought this for a gift but kept it for my self. It has basic functioanality, but easy to use. This definitely not for those expecting a powerhouse tablet, but for a child it is great!
The tablet is very light and streams well. I only use it to stream movies and it's much ligher then an iPad so makes mobility that much better.
Quenn Alexa, does it all. Move over Christina Aguilera, Alexa is the new genie in a bottle. She knows it all, weather, sports, history, music. Who needs school when you have your own personal teacher at voice command. You betta werk Alexa!
This is my first tablet, and I have had for just a short while. So far, it seems to be a great product for the price. I plan to use it primarily as a reader, which will allow me to stop accumulating books in my small apartment! So the small form factor seems to fit that purpose, and it's a bonus to have a browser and the availability of lots of apps too.
Great product I was excited to get it. I encouraged others to purchase one.
All I need,Great table great screen works as it should.
It is very user friendly. Recommend for most ages.
I started with a very old original kindle. Amd have been debating for... Well months if I should upgrade. I kept putting it off. My husband tells me I was dropping subtle hints all the time and he finally decided to pick it up for me and surprise me with it! I was at first a little put off with the rather high price but honestly once I started reading and playing with it... It is definitely worth it! This version more than the $200 one fits my style and in my opinion is better than the pricier one. You won't be disappointed!
I bought this for my dad. works great for a novice that just needs basics
The Kindle Fire 7" so far works well after about 6 weeks of daily use. The battery life is a bit disappointing - four hours or less. I bought this to replace my Kindle e-reader because it was for sale at a very good price. But, it functions much better as a basic tablet. I don't like reading for long periods with this screen. Sad to see my keyboard e-reader die, but these electronics don't last forever.
It's an excellent learning tablet for a child. I would recommend that every parent that has a small child to get one.
Great tablet for someone to start out with. I've never personally owned a tablet before this but I have used other family members tablets. This one feels like it is missing something. Some of the apps do not work on it. I still enjoy it though.
This tablet is great, nice size and functionality.
Clunky and full of ads. Ok for my kids to use for games, but I wouldn't use this for myself.
I really just needed a cheap Christmas gift for one of my god children ..
Alexia works well still a few bugs that need to be worked out but She gets better every day.
A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing.
Amazon Fire Tablet was an excellent purchase. Great display and very easy to use
I purchased this for my dad as his first tablet and he loves it. Technically, it's not a powerhouse but for the price it's the nicest little tablet you can get your hands on. It's perfect for a child, to use in the kitchen while cooking or kill time in the bathroom. Looks-wise it's pleasing and feels good in the hand.
I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and so far it has been good. It is him that is the problem. He isn't able to understand some of the stuff but will in time.
This is a fantastic EReader - very light and hand hold is just right. Love the backlight feature for reading at night without needing a light on.
VERY HAPPY WITH STREAMING CHOICE. THE FIRESTICK TV
My wife and I actually bought two of these for our two younger children. I love that they give us control over how much screen time they get, when they're available to be turned on, and when they turn off. As well as when they can play the games after their reading time. Just awesome.
It is a great tablet, I bought it for my 11 year old and he uses it responsibly. I also bought the glass screen protector and the sky blue cover for it in case he drops it. My son loves it and enjoys being able to not only play games on it, or take pictures, or even movies, but most importantly for the use of the advantages of it for its help when it comes to his education. I strongly recommend this product to everyone.
Bought for grandchild who is 10 and she loves it. Easy for her to handle and navigate. Price was awesome!
My 8 year old loves itEasy to setup and navigate.
Bought this for my daughter. It is inexpensive and user friendly. I use it all the time while she's at school.
It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips.
We purchased the Alexa without reading much up on it. We had several friends who raved about it, so we decided to get it before a pool party. It worked amazing!
Bought this for my 4yo daughter for Christmas and it's a sturdy little unit. It survived falls and drops but the one weak spot is the USB power plug, somehow my daughter managed to break it. However this is where Amazon stepped up as the tablet's warranty calls for Amazon to replace if damaged. I called customer service, they took my info and I had a brand new tablet deliver the next day!
It gives me viewing options that I love and the grand kids love playing the games
This toy is easy to setup and the 4k feature compliments my 4k tv. The dedicated amazon fire tv works better than amazon in my smart tv.
I bought 2 of these fire tablets for my children and I now want one for myself.
Alexa works very well and will connect to many of your automated home systems. There's a great amount of freestanding applications as well.
Awesome speaker, love that I can talk to it and it responds well
I am able to adjust the font size for easier reading. The size of the unit is small enough to fit in a pocket, and makes it more portable than other readers. It holds a charge for a much longer time than another reader, from another company does, which I appreciate. I hate starting to read, and find out the battery has run low and I have to stop to charge.
Amazon - Fire TV (2015 Model) - Black is great. It has all the entertainment and apps that my family and I need. Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, HBO, Amazon Prime TV, and Movies. It is definitely a fun device for playing a few games, watching movies, etc.... Connects to android game controllers for added fun. I believe it is 4k also.
I had to purchase this item to see if it was really nice like I was told.
Bought the FireStick after daughter got one and loved it. Went to get a second and they were out of stock. Was told the FireTV had faster processor and could handle 4K...don't have 4K, and honestly it's not worth the extra money for the processor speed difference ...save money and buy the cheaper FireStick
awesome love how easy it is to read and use even when i amat the beach
Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
Simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children.
Does what I wanted it to do. Really like the way it performs.
Not as good as i though, but at least it does what it is suppoused. Very bad screen quality
I love it would recommend it .. Works great and takes really good pic
My son is non stop on this tablet it's fast. He can look up anything on it and recoding video is clear. He loves it!
It was a Christmas present for my children and I think I made a excellent choice. I don't hear all the nagging and irritating out of them.I finally get to have a peace of mind also make sure to get insurance.I think the price was good to, I wish I didn't wait so late to make my purchase so I could have gotten them different colors.
I got this tablet for my nephews so they could play games and it is a good tablet!
I can listen to music during my bath. Also there are 39 games I can play and 40 I can't play yet. I am six.
I am glad I purchased the amazon fire tv. I get all the channels I want and more. Love the high def. I have been recommending it to all my friends and neighbors.
This is my son's 1st smart phone and so far, it does what he needs it to do.
Can't believe I waited so long to get a real e-reader. So easy to read from.
Really like reading a paper. My eyes feel good. I put many books inside and easy to read. Like it.
I still haven't used the camera, once I figure it out I will use it. I love the features on it. I use it for facebook mostly & emails. I also play some of the games on facebook.☺
Found information very readable and prices compatible.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, works good. Only downfall is no Google play only amazon apps.
This device offers a wonderful way to read books without creating more clutter in your home. The device is also easy to read even in the sun (unlike by IPad mini).
I bought this Tablet for my kids and it is Amazing. They are always on U tube!
I have had friends who told me how great the Exho is. Now I totally believe them. I love the easy access to our Amazon music and morning weather and news while we're preparing lunches. Super easy to set up on our network. No complaints so far.
He loves his new tablet! For a thirteen year old he loves it and takes it everywhere.
This is my second Kindle. My first was the basic model. This one is so clear and easy to read even in daylight. I love that I no longer need a light to read at night in bed.
This my 3rd Kindle paper white. My other two are completely full of great reads; my eyes are bigger than the number of hours in a day. I don't go anywhere without a kindle paperwhite in my purse; jacket pocket, etc because it's so compact and easy to adjust the size of the print if necessary.
My older kids helped me put in the child safety features and then it works great for my special needs daughter
I like this much better than the fire stick. Great for Alexa!
Great reading experience. All your books in one place. Compact. Excellent!!
We love this product, and are having so much fun with it. I can make a shopping list with it, get news, weather forecast , play our favorite music and so many other things that I have yet to discover.
For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying.
I bought this as a Father's Day gift for my brother. He just connected it and thought it was an awesome gift!
The sound is amazing and it lives up to all the hype.
Amazon tv is a great item! I love the fact that it can stream in 4K!
I use the echo for shopping list, answers to questions, music and much more. I love Alexa and would not trade her for anything!
I use my Kindle fire HD 10 in 3 ways 1 for reading Kindle books, 2 for streaming TV shows or movies while riding my exercise bike, 3 to surf the internet.
I have owned a few more similar products including the fire stick. The stick works on but the TV work great! Zero lag, runs like a top, streams perfectly! Its the perfect start for getting rid of your cable bill.
My kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. It's easy for them to use and very lightweight
I've bought 2 of these tablets now for my kids, they're a great value for its low price. Great screen quality, everything you need in a tablet and good size. Very happy with them.
I have received great feedback re: how easy to use - the size of it is perfect for kids. Easy to use.
This is a great product. I purchased for travel so i wouldn't have to carry my laptop. performs well very quick.
This is way better than the amazon fire stick. I would recommend in any day over it
A must have gor streaming apps. Kodi app is ok too if you get it going. Take it when traveling. Works fine as long as yoi have decent wifi
Have taken this for a couple of years for calmness, arthritis, and heart. Don't know if it really helps, but it doesn't hurt. Have read some favorable things about it. This company had quick delivery.
It was a present for my daughter and I am in love with the product. I want one for me
the recipient of this tablet uses it often and loves it so much that I'm buying one for myself.
Very easy to load up exodus and watch what every you wanna watch. With kodi. Never pay for cable againHave already recommended this to a few friends. They are all happy
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!
This is my first e-reader. It makes reading fun again. With Prime reading and my local library, I have many free reading options available to me. Easy to read in both bright sunshine and in the dark. Get one!
love my alexa. i have smart house items that works great with alexa and makes life a lil stress free
Better than I even thought it would be. Such a great purchase, I bought one for my parents.
Hard to use, Lots of ads, and Randomly closes apps
Have bought these for myself, grandkids and daughter. Nice size to put in purse and easy to take with you in car. Lots of uses for this.
If you want a virtual assistant Echo is the way to go. Amazon was very smart and making it so you can add on additional pieces for a very low cost. Pairs great with Amazon Prime account.
Mostly music are paid subscription. Not started home automation like switch controls.
Thought I'd be enjoying this more. Clever interface when Alexa gets it right, more frustrating than it should be when she gets you wrong!
If you like to read and like to have more than one option then an e-reader is something to consider. I like the screen when reader as it is not glaring like a tablet or computer screen. The ability to adjust the font size is very beneficial for me. I also like being able to highlight words and get their definition. I am not a fan of all of the controls but once you get use to them the Kindle is very useful. I wish I could convert PDFs to the Kindle format a little better but that is not a fault of the device.
This is the 4th Kindle we have.my wife had the older one she loves the camera and the size.
We purchased these for our twin 4 yr olds. These are working out great for them.
I love it. Will definitely recommend it to a friend.
This is the best value for bucks tablet out there in market and that too with awesome Amazon brand value.
Bought to replace older Kindle Fire. Perfect for what I need. Use mainly for e-books, apps, web browsing, and streaming occasional movies/shows.
This has been a great addition to our techno family. Great sound quality for music as well as a great resource for information.
This was very easy to use and set up and it's fun to have around the house
My kids love their kindles and love free time in it. Numerous educational games!
bought for my kid and it works great. fast enough for movies
I really wasn't sure if I would like this thing but now I carry it everywhere and have it loaded down with ebooks to read.
This is awesome for reading. Much better to read than my iPad Mini 2. The refresh from page to page, or when you set a bookmark, is more annoying than using the Kindle app on the iPad Mini. But for reading books it is easy on my eyes and it can't be beat. I read in bed before going to sleep and I can fall asleep easier after using my Kindle than the iPad.
I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
Easy setup with android. I have Amazon prime. Great with music.
I purchased one for each of my granddaughters. This tablet is taking longer to charge for some reason. Otherwise, great quality, runs smooth, and quickly.
No complaints works great and the battery is awesome as always
I was unaware that it did not Have the Google Play Store or any formidable Stores to choose from! Amazon has to many App Stores it would seem. I get "turned Around" sorta Speak.... Due to the fact that i am unfamiliar with your Services. I am Learning Day to Day, I just Like to hit the Ground Running! But thank you for your time and Sharing these devices and making them readily Available to the General Public! Thank You, Johnny Young
I bought this because of its great price as a gift. It is a great tablet for someone entering the tablet experience. It has so many features just like the more expensive choices. Happy with purchase especially since we can add a memory card too . To
I am so glad i got this tablet i can take it with me anywhere and use anytime
We really enjoy it. Bought it to watch our slingbox but we have found tons of extra content that we really enjoy
Great product!! My daughter loves it!!! She is two years old!!! Kids mode is the best.
This was an awsome purchase glad i made it will recommend
So many different ways to use the fire. I have just begun to learn some of the functions.
I used to constantly look at my phone to check the weather and simple things. Now I can just ask Echo.
I picked this up on Black Friday and ended up returning it the following week. This may be greater for an e-reader but can't replace a tablet for emails / amazon shopping.
Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
The Echo is a great bluetooth speaker - fantastic base response. Of course, it gives you Alexa as well - which is sometimes very good - but other times disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this if you pay full price, but when Best Buy has a sale this can be a great deal.
Good product, but Alexa doesn't know all the answer!!
Great tablet for the price, however the ad upon the lock screen is irritating.
Great 5 stars every home needs one. Just program it. Like it work for you
Enjoyed a lot. Great tablet for the price: well worth the money spent! A bargain!
We are so pleased with this tablet. We purchased one for each of our grandsons. They can all use them, play games together and send messages to the grandparents once in awhile.
This l'il baby does everything my wife wants from her laptop without forcing her to sit at a table to do it. For the money this cannot be beaten!
It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible.
This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
A great product for the price, performs bigger than what you would expect. The memory expansion elevates this tablet to allow for multiple content and apps.
Purchased for using Freetime with three year old. So far so good. The three year old is able to use and enjoys. Did get the amazon case.
Finally upgraded my kindle, and adore everything about it.
I bought this as a Birthday gift for my son. He saw videos about it and fell in love with it. Once we plugged the Echo in, it was an instant hit in the home! Setup is simple and Alex is ready to assist in moments. Amazon hit the nail on the head with this one.
I have wanted Echo ever since it came out. I ordered it off of amazon and they kept saying it was on the wait list. Walked into Best Buy and it was on the shelve in the store. Grabbed one and it was worth the wait. When I got home called Amazon and cancelled my order.
nothing to say about this product...bought as a gift
Faster than the Fire stick and worth the extra money.
I love this Kindle the ease of use and the amount of books I can carry in a small package is awesome
I love my fire! Does all that I need it to and more!!!! However only four stars because I can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless I pay $15. it does have a lot of glare but I don't mind the glare too much! Speed is great lots of storage!;
Every time I ask Alexa for something, my 2 year old grandson runs over and tries to pronounce her name, he's almost there, hopefully he'll have a question for her as well. He likes dancing to the nursery rhymes that I ask her to play for him.
he loved it was a great gift easy to use, small and great
Have both the Apple TV and now the fire. Picture quality is noticeably better with fire, as advertised. The only issue is the organization of the home screen could use some work, but overall, worth the money
I'VE had other kindles and when my current ones storage became low I knew I wanted to purchase another one. It can be used for a variety of uses.
The tablet was everything I was looking for for my little girl thank you so much for making such an amazing tablet
I bought this for a 17 yr old.He absolutely loves it.The price for this tablet makes it so affordable.
The Kindle fits me to a "T". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done.
Enjoying the Fire for reading & more; still exploring all the uses
I had an older Kindle that worked great but finally died. My husband had a white page and seemed to love it. After purchasing mine I understand why. I highly recommend this to anyone who reads a lot.
I bought this for my son and one for my son-in-law. They are mesmerized by all that the Echo is capable of doing. (I want one!)
it meets my expectations. speed,storage,efficiency and effective,reliable
i was skeptical but glad I purchased. much faster than Nook or the paperwhite. Thin and easy to use. Screen appears brighter and wider than the paperwhite. Very thin and lightweight
Bought three of these for a 4, 6, and 10 year olds. I am so glad that it is so simple to use. They love that the can easily find books and games that suit each of their interests. For $34.99, it was so worth it.
My 2 year old loves this thing. Uses it mostly for Netflix. Major issue with this is that it barely has any memory. It is very limited as to what and how much you can put on it.We have about 10 apps/games or less and Netflix app. It will not allow anything more as it has no space.
This basic Amazon Kindle is a great value considering its power and retail price.
This is a pretty cool little device. Im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. Only drawback is I wish it had more storage. But for the price, it works good.
It was a gift to our granddaughter for Christmas and she was and is thrilledwith the device. She especially will use the Geek Squad information service.
We bought the echo for ourselves and enjoyed the features so much we bought several as Christmas presents. The music library is tremendous, love having the shopping list as it synchs with the app. Still some learning to be done by Alexa and our preferences, but overall, very happy with this purchase.
I bought this one for a family member because I loved mine so much! She was very pleased.
We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.
Can use it for best streaming. Can watch all the shows in best quality. Nice piece of equipment when we have no T V
This tablet is perfect for kids and adults for me if I was the owner I wouldn't want a little bit more memory and ram but that's why I own a laptop now it has an interface that allows you to set up a profile for a kid individually That's what makes it perfect for kids and you control. It also has latest and greatest apps exc. It runs games ok but movies stream well and really for me this is great I have 4 girls from ages 10 to 4 and they all have something and this one is the best of all of them.
I bought one echo. Liked it so much I bought the tap, for and another echo.
It was easy to set up. My grandson has enjoyed the broad selection of activities from which to choose.
the amazon echo is a wonderful piece of technology. She tells jokes, plays music and you can play games with her too. there are more practical uses as well. She can control your wifi enabled household devices, like turning lights on or adjusting the AC. The equipment to do that is still pretty pricey, but she is good just for entertainment. The only bad part is, she can't push audio out to my bluetooth speakers. I think the DOT can but not the echo.
The Fire TV is a wonderful device. I have the Stick and I think that the TV is much better.
I think this tablet works as well as my $200.00 8in. HD Kindle Fire. At $35.00 it is a steal, it is such a bargain!
The Kindle Voyager did not come with a charger so I'm glad I purchased this - although the Kidle Voyager does not need charging up as often because it stays charged for a long time. Mae Ogino
Good speed compared to the other models just the size and weighs very little. Large viewing area for a 8" tablet HD
I bought this Fire TV 3 months ago. One day, out of the blue, it stopped working. Power is on but as soon after I see the Amazon logo the screen goes black. I google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it. I just emailed the company and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted 3 months before it became useless. Not a happy camper here!!!
Awesome product for a great price. Love the rewards program.
Purchased this on cyber Monday and it was worth it. Alexa is my new best friend.
Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them.
With a high functioning WIFI and an Amazon Prime Account you have all of the personal functionality of a Pad of I. My kids use them, bang the heck out of them and they keep on ticking. They have destroyed 3 Ipads, so for a kid at home, it is very nice. -Borat
We have had the full-size Echo for over a year, and I love it. The Tap requires you to push the button before Alexa responds to your requests, so that takes a little getting used to after using the big Echo's voice activated requests. The Tap speaker is not as good as the big Echo, but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge. Overall, I really like this...and I found it at best buy for $78!
The glass on top of the reader is absolutely a slick and beautiful piece added on what is already an excellent device. Worth the extra $$$.
My wife bought this for my 6 year old son after his Nabi-Tab went south. Overall has been a solid purchase
I love this device! Its very easy to use and makes cable irrelevant.
I absolutely love this Amazon Fire TV!! It's processor is so much faster than fire stick which I love the stick too. I get to watch so many of my favorite movies and tv shows plus they have so many great apps for anything you want!! I highly recommend this product!
does everything our other tablets do and more. Like the sharing across platforms.
This purchase was a no-brainer. The Kindle Paper white is all you need for an e-reader. Plus with Amazon you have an opportunity for many free e-books.
Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
would have been nice to have instructions included
Bought this as a gift for a family member to replace an older tablet, works great.
I was a little worried getting these since we have always had Apple but wow what a great buy. Tons of games same as iPad and Hulu and Netflix access. Thank god I grabbed these instead of iPads
great- easy to set up- great gift item- small and fits in purse!
First day of purchase it overheats. Defective product.
The amazon echo is good. It answers questions as asked but needs to be able to look up music without be linked to a specific account
Prime integration is smooth and voice recognition is much better than Siri
I love my new tablet. The size is just right and love that I can access the internet or play games anytime, anywhere!
My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect
It's exactly what you'd think it would be. No more, no less...a perfect e-reader for traveling and backpacking.
Really enjoy my echo. Great sound fun to use and stylist
This is such a great gift for the whole family!! I would recommend
We purchased this tablet for my Grandfather and it works great for his use cases:Light web browsingNetflixEmail
I bought several of these tablets for my grandchildren. They love it!
i bought 2 for a 3 and 4 year old grand-babies and its so easy to use for both of us.
Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
good tablet for my purpose. using when wanting to look up things when not at computer
it's easy to set up and start enjoying Amazon Prime.
This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.
Since this is an Android 5 based tablet, I sideloaded a few necessary apps to allow it to be used essentially the same as an Android tablet, with Google play store, etc. The screen resolution, speaker, RAM are just only adequate. Otherwise, a good cheap tablet. Really need to ponder its utility before buying it.
This is a gift for my son which he loved. Good for a music lover.
I needed an extra charger for our cabin so that we would not have to pack one back and forth. Arrived just in time and on time that I got it in time for our next trip over. Works like the original.
I bought these as gifts. They were simple to operate and you can't beat it for the price.
Lighter weight than my old kindle fire. Easier to carry with me.
My kids love the tablet and it's easy for them to use
Got this tablet on Black Friday. I love how easy it was to get this tablet up and going. Now I don't have to use my phone to get on the internet. If you are looking for an affordable tablet, this is the one for you.
Perfect for taking on vacation and with memory cards I can take all the pics I want.
Great product for readers, low on eyes. Takes time to get used to.
I brought this tablet based on word of mouth. After buying this item I see that it is easy to use.
This is the fastest streaming device on the market. It's as if a mini computer is operating behind my television!!!
Very useful,Very handy.Best when you travel due to prtability
I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did.
We bought 2 of these for our 2 oldest grandkids. They loved them and were excited to receive them and to use them on a trip to Florida.
Great sound and pretty user-friendly... doesn't do exactly what I thought it did
My 5 year old loves it! She can order books and look at all her favorite shows
My husband bought me this for Christmas and I love it! Bigger than my phone but small enough for me to hold. I also bought a case for it that helps it to stand up.
I like the convenience of my Kindle a lot for reading, and the process for buying books from Amazon is easy and flawless, as well as cheaper than buying physical books. There are a lot of $1.99 specials of very good books. I just wish the Kindle was slightly larger - more the size of a typical paperback book - because when I'm reading it feels like I'm "turning" a page every few seconds.
This kindle is everything I wanted. No Glare, no bells and whistles, simply a device I can read a book on anywhere. I would highly recommend it!
6year old son loves it. It is dependable and economical in price. All features are easy to use and makes reading fun if your child is into reading books on te web.
Not yet sure all it can do but love that I can just ask for the weather or ask it to play music by a particular artist. Fun to work with.
Bought it for my kids and they love it. So then I bought myself one. I rake it every where
unit must be charged frequently still trying to learn the fire
I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!
Loved it so much I bought another one. The hands free is so good. I use it in my shop, when I am busy I just tell it to stop and it does.
Best tablet for kids will buy again. Purchased about 5 already,good for whole family
The best tv box !! Fast and hard. I love amazon thanks
I live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool.
This is my first tablet. Use it mostly for checking email and using face book. I have not used it for reading books yet, but plan too.
this electronic book reader is great, able to read ebooks, watch movies, play games. or browse the internet. it lets you hookup to any internet connection you want to use as long as its range
I love traveling so this has been perfect for taking books wherever I go.
Most tablets in this price range have the quality to show for it. That is not the case with this unit.While only $50, it feels more sturdy and acts more responsive and capable than other bargain tablets that fit into the same price range.The amazon app store has a lot of great options and the popular apps you would expect from apple or Googles app stores. The only downside is the navigation. Even then, it is only a personal problem as I am used to Google play.All in all, this is a great tablet at an even greater price!
Bought this for my mother who has not used a tablet often and already she loves it and it helps to occupy her time since she has retired.
this sounds amazing , it is convenient to ask for a tune , and it does lots of other thing i do not know how to use it for yet , but in short , way cool
My second Echo. Working with a Smartthings hub and various automation devices. Works well and skills are growing in number.
I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
I got this tablet for my mom as an additional after X-mas gift. She likes the clean/simple/no fuss/etc. way a tablet works, ie, no keyboard/mouse/etc., just your fingers for input.
It works well with the Apps, easy to connect to the internet
Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick.
Our household enjoys this fun gadget. I recommend this.
This was a gift for my sister. She never had a reader or tablet. Now she has both. Easy to use, nice size for traveling. great price!
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I can't seem to keep her off of it now. What a great Buy.
bought this for my 2 years old, the tablet is strong, and he loves it, and best part is i was able to download the google play store without rooting.
Purchased the device for my neice, she loves it, highly recommend
This was a perfect gift for my son for Christmas of 2015
good product. bought it for somebody else, so i spent little time on it.
Does what you need, but because it has amazon's name on it, it's expensive
Great. Works great for the kids to do their online homework.
Useful around the house, put it in the kitchen and can use it for timers, reminders, asking for sports scores (faster than changing the channel on the TV and checking myself). "Tell me a joke" is usually pretty good, too.Now looking into connecting other things to it, like light switches, etc.
We love this product and enjoy streaming movies and such.
This is a great little tablet especially for the price.
Love this little device as it runs better Than other boxes. It's a simple machine that has great capability.
I used to use a bluetooth speaker system now I use ECHO! The bluetooth box was stupid, Alexa is a smart lady. I Love it, the music alone is awesome.
I was tired of the insane cable bills, so I bought the fire tv.........goodbye cable, fire tv meets all my needs
For the price you can't beat it , bought 4 as stocking stuffers 2 years ago, besides the one that went swimming in the bath all are still working as should
Bought for gift for my 8 year old niece she loved it it's great for a starter and well priced
Great price for a tablet.Bought this for my father
Good product if you don't want to spend money on iPad. Great just for surfing internet.
Gave the Kindle Paperwhite as a gift to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Great battery life.
Great quality and cheap price I like this product and very friendly service
This Amazon TV was very easy to set up. I really enjoy all the features that it has to offer. I find myself not watching cable TV as much because now I can pick and choose the type of programs I prefer to watch. The problem with cable TV other than the outrages high prices is that you are paying for channels that you never watch.
I like the reader, nice and small. What i don't like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home, it does not let you set it up. I had to go to my daughters house and set it up. That is a bit alarming. It should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised. Make it more secure and easy to put protection on it. That is the only reason I didn't make it a 5 star product.
Definitely has nice features, however, I prefer the navigation on the Apple TV.
Great product for the price. I would buy NVIDIA shield if it wasn't too expensive
Easy to use at any age level. Should of got another one
It functions well and meets all my needs as an entry level tablet. The only downside is that everything on it is geared toward amazon but the price makes up for it.
The paper white screen is so easy to read in dark and light conditions. I read in bed before going to sleep and the screen brightness is low enough that it doesn't affect your melatonin production so it won't interfere with your sleep cycles. I used to use a tablet but it was too bright and bulky.
My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.
Us good for My family I recommend yo My Friends good programs good signal
Intuitive to use, I read in bed every night for a couple hours. Battery lasts about three days, my other kindle (original), lasted about 8 days. But charges quickly.
I bought this for my husband. He really likes it much better than I thought he would.
Loving these tablets. They keep the girls busy. For their age, best Christmas present so fat
very happy with this item, protects well, looks good, and was easy to install
The tablet works well. Do wish it play store. It is easy enough for him to use.
Used several TV box before, and amazon fire TV's major pros is the root privilege to install app. So far so good. Quickly delivery!
love this firetv. i have an amazon account, but i installed and subscribe to PlaystationVue to get channels i used to pay comcast for - WAY cheaper. easy product to setup and use- definitely worth the $$ to be able to dump cable tv!!
I did some research on different types of tablets and this one had what I needed
bought as a gift and they loved it. it works fast and good
It's a great tablet for my nine year old. She does her homework on it.
Good product.
This is an amazing tablet for the price! I bought 4 at Christmas for the grands and one for me!
I bought this for my dad for christmas. He works long hours and like to watch movies and play games when he has a little break and this is perfect for just that.
I use it for everything. I listen to music all the time this makes it easier and clearer. The weather , the news i could go on and on. I love it and would buy it again in a heart beat.
I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
It is very kid friendly. It was very easy to use at home.
You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 2 year old it's ok
Love it, talk to it all the time. Even tell it good night every night !!! She is pretty smart !!!
great speaker and alexa is awesome. works seamless with phone and with amazon service. directional mic is great
Great product I recommend it to everyone who loves watching tv
Reads like a book instead of a tablet. Saves on book storage space and is always on hand. Looks good sitting on my nightstand. No clutter.
Its ok for price point but it is heavily advertised to manipulate you to purchase more from amazon.
I bought kindles for my twins last November and I loved this product so much that I purchased them for my triplets for their birthday.
I bought it for the options with the smart home integration. I am quite pleased with the 3rd party integration with nest, Lutron and others. I am not so into the skills with games that it offers. It seems to be the best on the market so far.
It's a great value for the price point of the tablet
So i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job. A guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome! I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all
This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books !
I love this Kindle. I have read about 7 book since I bought it and I used to only read about two a year
Awesome I will definitely recommended this to anyone
I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price.
Good beginner tablet for kids. Could use a better resolution screen, but overall it is good.
The Kindle Voyager is the best E-reader you can buy! The resolution is absolutely amazing. The long lasting battery is, by far, the best feature.
Alexa sits in my home office and plays music for me throughout the day. She is also quite helpful when my children ask me questions that I don't have time to look up for them. Fun product, easy information gathering.
My soul purpose for buying this item was to read which I am completely satisfied for it, howevef, the camera quality isn't of great quality
The tablet is good. It is a little slow but I'm not sure if it's my wifi or the tablet. I like that you can add a memory card :)
We bought this for our son for Christmas, he's 9. It is exactly what he needed, plenty of games, he can watch videos, etc but I can feel safe with him using it thanks to the easily set parental controls.
I really like the bigger screen. These are great for traveling with children
The sound from this unit is just incredible and with almost 20 million songs for $3.99 to $7.99 a month depending on the Amazon plan, it just doesn't get any better. Add in the fact it controls all the lights in my home, my Samsung robot vacuum and can answer almost any question I ask her, it is hard to imagine life without my Alexa...
Replaced an old blue ray cd player. Less space used and very fast response time.
Love this product. Glad I upgraded! The features make it easy to read while traveling by car or plane.
Simple to use and great for a child's first electronic
Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive.
AMAZON ECHO IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT AND ALOT OF FUN,ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAY GOOD MORNING TO ALEXA, SHE ALWAYS TELLS A JOKE FOR THE DAY AND THIS ITEM IS ALOT OF FUN AND AMAZING, IT IS GREAT MAKING YOUR MUSIC PLAYLIST UP AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE ALEXA PLAY IT WHEN YOU WANT TO!JUDI
I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids.
The screen is beautiful, great for daylight or night. Very soothing in eyes. Kindle has a huge collection of books. If you love books, you will love kindle
This product allows is to stream almost all tv shows and movies made. We are able to look at old as well as new shows.
Alexa is ready quickly and very easy to use. Accurate information and good sound quality
Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card.
This just is so much fun to use. So easy to ask for music to be played. Quality is good too. We ask about our sports teams and ask for jokes. We just sit and laugh at how this works. We are just starting to use it for our shopping list. We used to use OneNote, but it is so easy to ask Alexa to add a product to the shopping list. She repeats it and has always gotten it right. You can also add it manually on the app. We love playing around with it and are learning new commands.
I like to use it for movies and a lot of tv programs.
I use to control my smart devices in the home and listen to music. my kids also use to help them with their home work.
My daughter absolutely love her tablet and I love it to for her. It's very kids friendly
The Kindle from Best Buy has made it easier for me to read. This is my first e-reader. I like the Voyage 6 for its brightness and speed, plus thelarge variety of reading material. I know Amazon is in the business ofmaking money by getting me to purchase Kindle books. However, I havefound several Kindle books available for free from my public library. I will, no doubt, buy some Kindle books elsewhere in the future. Best BuyHas been good to me. I did have a little problem finding someone in thestore who was well-informed on this product but finally got what I wanted.
Kindle is still the top ereader. My first one finally "wore" out from years of daily use. It was so light to hold and to travel with. Battery life was great and it was so easy to read in daylight. This updated model is so much better. The backlight is a great improvement and is such a delight to use at night while reading in bed. This basic model is really all you need for reading books
This was a Christmas gift for a toddler. He loves this gift.
It is a tablet that cost $50. You get what you pay for. It is not more powerful than an iPad but it is in my opinion more durable and is easier to pack when traveling. I only use mine to watch videos on the road. It does have trouble connecting to certain wifi spots but this hasn't been a problem at any airports gets.The touchscreen lags but once the video starts going there hasn't been a problem. It cost less than the price to fix a broken screen on an iPhone why pass it up.
Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it.
My grandbaby loves hers. We gave it as a Christmas present!
Full disclosure, I've only had iPads in the past. I needed an android based tablet as a 3rd party app that I needed was yet IOS supported. You get what you pay for. Build quality, touch and feel, yes it's equal to the price. Constant adds urging you to make various Amazon based purchases...not my cup of tea but I guess fills a price point and need.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my teenage son. He's been very pleased with it. The battery lasts long, it is small and light enough to fit in his jacket pocket, and the selection of books is awesome. Great product.
My sis will never be detached from her fire, she is truly hooked on it.
It's really good for reading and for having a small tablet. To browse with.
Much nicer than the competition, fast wifi or LAN hookup. The menu is fast and easy to work with. The voice search is helpful and works like Google search or Siri.
Wanted to be able to read outdoors w/out glare and also at night w/out a light on. Already have laptop and smart phone so don't need another connected device. Works beautiful in all lighting conditions.
I bought the Amazon Echo to use mainly as a speaker to listen to music. I am learning to use other functionality that Alexa provides and it has been useful. Alexa understands my commands 95% of the time and allows immediate feedback on how it responds to my commands. Looking forward to using more of its functionality.
I love my new Echo - I can play music for myself and for my grandkids as well as my wife and we all love it - we all can ask questions and get answers instantly
Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
Received as a gift. Questions have to be asked in a certain way to be answered correctly. The sound is awesome. I can connect my iPhone by bluetooth to play music.
I think it is good compliment to regular cable. If you have subcriptions to the various apps (netflix, amazon, hulu etc.) You may be able to eliminate cable all together. It works seamless with remote. The voice feature is ok but I haven't really gotten the jist of it. Overall good product.
I love the way we can program it for my grands....
Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices.
Works great. Easy to use and small enough for travel. The only complaint is my first one would not charge after 2 yrs of use.
Bought this a a gift for my wife, who loves to read, but who has absolutely no use for or interest in information technology and the tools of that trade. She can barely tolerate email, and refuses to interact with a smartphone. Once introduced to Kindle, however, she has become hooked. It is light, easy to carry, seldom needs to be charged, turns pages with a touch, and is a veritable portable library.It was an inspired gift - and who knows where it might lead.
My son is 6 and loves it. It's very easy to use...
Very useful for night time reading responsive and intuitive display
Until now it look as a nice product.Just a bit expensive.
Bought this tablet as a gift for my daughter. Pretty sure she will love it!
Works very well as long as you have good internet speed. Saves us a lot of money not paying for satellite.
Upgraded my kindle, easy and fast transfer from old to new
Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.
Love this product! I bought 1 about 6 weeks ago and quickly knew this was my favorite new "gadget". So when the discount was offered, I snatched up another one!
My kids have really enjoyed this tablet. This makes car rides a lot easier. They both can create and learn and they love the camera.
I brought 3 of them. 2 were gifts. We love them. Awesome price.
Very lightweight and portable with excellent battery life.
Very easy to use. I bought it for my 6 year old. Quality and ease of use is really great. Would recommend buying this first before getting an ipad for your child.
I would highly recommend this product. Easy to set up and use. Opens the door to see shows otherwise would have been overlooked. Will buy again.
i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
THIS TABLET IS VERY SIMPLE TO USE. I WAS HAPPY THAT I COULD BASICALLY OPEN THE BOX AND START USING IT. . I HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO MY FRIENDS.
The best reader from Kindle and I can surf the web as well.
This is really the best one on the market. I was lucky to get such a good price at Best Buy! Thanks!
This will be great for my parents who are older because it easy to use.
My son loves it. Easy set up. And the best part is the case. It really is childproof. My son has dropped it and nothing had happened. Very durable. Just what my son needed.
What great interactive features...understands commands very well except when music is loud. Why not add a digital or analog output so it can be used in conjunction with your home audio as well?
Easy to use, compact, and great sound. Set up was very easy
I love my echo. There's not much you can't ask Alexa. Very informative.Great sound when listening to music. And the games are fun to play with friends. I wouldn't trade it for nothing else!
Very entertaining and helpful! Kids enjoy it as much as us adults do!
Purchased this item for a book reader only. Kindle is one of the best as far as I am concerned.
So this is more than just another electronic gadget. First the sound from the echo is way above average, not Sono's but not far off. Second is the ability you will have to make your home a "smart" home. Echo will be able to control your lights, plugs, thermostat, garage door, sprinkler system etc. some of the random features are fun like " tell me a joke" or sing happy birthday or what is the weather like in DubaiWell worth the price.
Best E-book reader. You can purchase books from any provider other than Amazon and send it to your kindle e-mail account.
Hard to argue with an amazon fire tv or stick. I bought this to replace my previous one that only did 1080p. Having had both I would say you won't go wrong with either. I bought the firetv for the direct Internet plug in capability which I figured would be a concern with wifi
Great deal for the cost. Would purchase item again.
Bought it as a gift, wife loves it. Plenty of memory and available apps.
Have been reviewing this tablet on amazon for some time. Its an extra for us we keep it in the living room.
Kindle has nailed it when it comes to tablets. They are affordable and efficicient for the money.
I purchased for my son, he said it is the best gift he has ever received
I bought this as a raffle prize and it was a big hit of the young as well as the old.
Would not recommend to anybody I had to take it back three times and still would not hook up to TVs very poor customer service
This product is great for reading you the news, a book or the weather. Alexa is great at setting timers and alarms and telling silly jokes. If you ask Alexa a "google" type question such as "What was the score to 'such and such' college basketball game", most times she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of ways. Sometimes, you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and Alexa will answer. This proves frustrating to me. It is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystrokes. I am considering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement.
Bought this for my husband at Christmas. He is VERY happy with it and It keeps him out of my hair. Bought one for our young son too. Now i can breathe. LOL. We've had no issues with them and has more than met our expectations. Well worth the money & a VERY good deal!
Very easy to hook up, great to have all the extra channels, like ESPN 3.
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it Many apps for kids
Bought for someone not tech savvy and he's done great
Didn't really need this but it came in a kit with my kindle. Can never have too many.
Very good product overall. my wife loves it.......
I get this for my 11 years old daughter ... Is good, basic tablet
I love it and I'm I'm not using even a quarter of Alexa's capabilities. The thing that I love the most so far is the shopping list feature. If I take something out of the fridge that I need to restock I just ask Alexa to add it to my shopping list then its on my phone when I go to the store! no stopping in the middle of a recipe to find my phone to add the item. Also works great with Pandora radio. If a song that I don't know is playing and I want to know the name and artist I can either ask Alexa or look at the app on my phone. Looking forward to learning more about what she can do.
Amazon Echo is great. But it is stuck at home. Amazon Tap on the other hand goes everywhere. In the short time we have had ours, we have brought it to Sweden, Portugal, the lake up north and friend's houses. It has served as a music host at card games, answered questions and added things to our shopping list. It is easy to set up Amazon Tap to a wifi network using the Alexa app on your smartphone. You can also easily pair several devices to the Tap via Bluetooth. What really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated. New skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis. Amazon really hit home with the Tap as the voice interface is so easy to use, and the portability makes it a great.
Exceeds my expectations. Great fun for the whole family. Daily jepordy is lots of fun!. Add the nest thermostat and light controls and you won't be sorry.
I love this tablet. It does pretty much every thing my ipad does!!!!
Perfect for the weekend especially when it rains. Great movie selections
Bought this for my mother, it is inexpensive and easy to use it's a lot of fun too.
Why buy an I-pad when you can pay much less for a tablet that will do everything you need it to do, plus you get all the cost benefits of Amazon purchasing. One of the best buys on the market.
Great for moderate use. It is awesome for movies and light reading.
Anyone should be able to run this tablet its really easy to use and good quality for low price
This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline.
Bought for my 14 year old son for Christmas. He likes the Amazon fire and using frequently...primarily for playing games. My husband has had one for several years and uses it every day.
This is my second Fire TV and the setup is as easy as the first. Very simple to use and the benefits pay for itself. Worth it.
its the best way to watch tv and movies it has everything you need
Bought product for my 6 year old grandson. It's easy for him to read ,watch movies and play games on.
Got this tablet for my kids(ages 3 to 8). Really good starter tablet with excellent parental controls on it. Does not necessarily have all the bells and whistles, but still an excellent tablet, especially for the kids!
I needed something to read kindle books on and to watch occasional videos with. This inexpensive tablet packs a lot of features for a great price. Does everything I ask of it.
I have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. This tablet is fast & the videos stream in great (as long as you have good Wi-Fi connection). Easy access to Amazon too.
My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader.
Our daughter had asked for The Paperwhite for Christmas, and she was delighted when she opened it. She used it for hours every day, so we view this as a really proper gift.
Tried setting this up on 2 TV's using both WIFI and Ethernet for hours. Could never get a signal. A total waste of time.
Alexa works great and I like that she learns as she goes I even got 3 dots to work just like her.
I was looking for something basic to read on before bed and this fit the bill perfectly. Bonus it has camera lol
I love the tablet and the price was great ,easy to use.
This is a great tablet for a kid! It is easy to use and play on!
I would purchase these again,my grandkids love them.
Love love love! No squinting, no glare just beautiful words! Bought one as a gift for an avid reader friend too.
I love this thing. So much fun and so easy. It is also like having an assistant standing there to help you. How great is that!
Extremely durable and user friendly very satisfied with this product
Very universal in use and was of applications. Real quick in response
The tablet is good for basic uses and is low cost.
I love it , this was a great investment for my family
I have more fun with this thing… I'm much more likely to play music or check the temperature or news, because Alexia is constantly attached to my network and is always charged and ready to go. There's no pairing required, so I simply call out her name and she responds. There is always a battle between me and my teenager, trying to outshout Alexa instructions, so we can hear the music that we like best!
I had been looking for something to watch my Amazon Prime and this gives me an easy way to do it plus Netflix, HBO and more. Easy plug and go makes it good to move from room to room easily
Purchased this and I love it! It's easy to setup and easy to use.
I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
Great product for the price but make sure to purchase a separate SIM card, 8GB fills up fast.
I purchased this kindle for my daughter inlaw for Christmas. She absolutely loves it!
This tablet works perfect for me reading books on it. I love the option to have the blue light disabled so I can read comfortably in the dark.
A nice tablet for the money. I use the Fire as a secondary tablet to by iPad but I find I use it as much as the iPad. Great for traveling because of its size. I am happy with the purchase. I have found that it charges fine when using the cord/plug that comes with the unit but charges slow if you use a different cord/plug.
Amazon fire tv has everything you will ever need in terms of streaming. I only carry local cable channels since purchasing this box
I like using them so much that I bought one for everyone in the family and I have three at home.
This is a fun and convenient toy; however, it doesn't have the capability to answer as many re questions as I would have thought.
This was recommended to me. Good product, can avail Amazon prime and will automatically get hook up & have an access to it.
Product was good for $50. Heavier than I expected. I was looking to replace an older Kindle. Nothing fancy but adequate.
This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.
I was not expecting much with this product, but man I was surprised how well it worked. I added the charter app and I am able to watch live tv on it.
Bought this item cause it was bigger than my phone and I could put all my books on it with a larger screen.
I'm really enjoying my amazon fire tv. I should have bought it a long time ago. Alexa is a very cool feature.
Will never buy a amazon tablet for games again it dosent have Google play and the games take forever to download!!!
First I wanna say that the Amazon Fire Series is the best in media streaming devices out now. I purchased this do to the fact that i had a best buy rewards coupon since i racked up a lot of points from previous purchases. I was curious to see if this worked just like the fire stick. I am here to say it does and better. I wanted to try out my ethernet connection (RJ45) cable and see if it would lag or buffer. So far it has not. You can install kodi tv on this just like the fire stick. I just installed kodi version 17.1 and i must say it works faster and the movies are more clearer as well. I run it through my home audio receiver with an hdmi passthough which is more efficient for most of the smart tvs on the market today. The audio is way better i had to go to the settings on kodi and change from a 2.0 channel to 5.1 channel. It also has a sd card slot & usb drive as well don't know if i will ever need that.If you are an amazon prime member is also a good advantage as well because you can also stream any amazon prime video for free. Good job Amazon!!
This is the best tablet that has ever come on the market for $49!
Kindle products are easy to use and set up. It does most everything the expensive tablets do.
I bought this as a present for someone and they were delighted. They love that it is compact and easy to use.
I have been very satisfied with my new kindle and use it almost every day!
From me to me. Love this tablet and the price was 49.99
give the tablets to my grandsons they love them and would buy them as gifts
I've purchased several for family members and everyone is loving all the content available. Easy purchase may be back for more!!
I bought this for my ten year old daughter. This is so much better than carringing around a bunch of heavy books. The battery also lasts forever
the paperwhite makes reading in all conditions a pleasure.
Cant believe we waited to buy one, love how easy it is to use and the interaction with all my devices!!
This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on!
Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
This was a gift, actually bought 2 of these for the grandkids and they love them. Easy to set up and get going-they are solid and well made. Very pleased with this purchase.
The grandkids love it they spend time playing the games they like.
Great product easy to set up and understand. Highly recomended
This is a good device. I initially bought the google home. I was very dissatisfied with it. I returned it and bought Amazon Echo. I am happy with it. I have had some difficulty a few times getting it to recognize my voice, but it is a very good unit. I am still learning what all it can do.
You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.
My little one loves all free apps.Shes quiet on long car rides when she brings along Fire table.
Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it.
great starter tablet for any 2nd grader on up great price
The amazon 4K is amazing. Way better than the stick. The box runs smoother than the stick and wor
My only frustration is that you can't use a flash drive to view video or photos without purchasing a app that may or may not work. Other than that the product is awesome!
Using the Echo is very easy and it creates a great addition to any smart home.
Kindles are an excellent device for all book lovers
Very easy to use and navigate. My 6 and 4 year old grandsons can use them with ease. Some apps are limited as you do not have Google Play, but there is plenty of games and learning games available.
The device is excellent and you program is easy and your price is very economic
I spent a lot of time resisting the Kindle and using the app on my iPad but I took the plunge on the Paperwhite for a long trip I wanted to use my iPad for TV while reading. The paperwhite is crisp, you can read it through day and night and downloads books with a quickness. I never would have thought such a simple device ended up taking priority over everything on my list of travel gear.Whether I'm on a red-eye or sitting on my back porch in the day, I can see the text comfortably and crisply. Really love this reader. Don't cheap out on the one without the backlight!
It hasnt given me any problems much better than the last one i purchased love amazon
Bought for a kid and can't be beat at the $30 sale price.
Great addition to my Alexa collection. Very portable, batter lasts as expected.
Like it better than the keyboard one. No need for a case with light the brightness adjusts which makes it nice.
This thing is awesome. Funny, easy to use and I think even has a personality. Easy to set up and sounds great musically. We use it it for research,music and setting timers for cooking. It will tell you the weather and how traffic looks. The future is finally here! Highly recommend checking this out.
Bought a 7' kindle on Black Friday for $34.00. What a great price for a great gift..
Easy set up, tons of music, easy to use. If you are looking for voice activated, this is not it.
I love the functionality of this Amazon Tablet. Bought one for me and one for the hubby! Daughter is the next one to get one!
This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily
Excellent product. KINDLE/Amazon has an extensive library of books to choose from. Love the Back light. Light weight and excellent for travel when you don't want the weight of books but want your books to read.
I went to purchase a new tablet because I had misplaced my old one. I told the sales person in that department that I was interested in one of the cheaper tablets that you have on display and he asked me if I had ever owned a Kendal. I told him that I had purchased 2 of them previously and really liked them. He then told me that the newest Kendal had just been delivered 2 weeks previously and it was only $48.99. I said WOW that's a great price for a Kendal and of course that is what I purchased. The sales person was very polite and professional. I really enjoyed the experience.
The only drawback is that this tablet does not have access to all apps. Other than that it is a great product.
This is the best kindle yet. Very sharp text and easy page management.
It works very well out of the box. Most of the apps you want will be there. The remote works flawlessly and is blue tooth so you don't have to point it at the box. Amazon locks down android, so you are missing some apps, but all of your streaming apps will be here. Expanded memory is nice as well. Great beginner device.
I wanted to cut the cord from satellite tv and search for a lower cost alternative. I LOVE the Amazon Fire TV. Easy to set up. Only disappointment is I can't watch all of the same programs/channels I did on satellite TV. I am saving $120/mo since I cut the cord!!
I LOVE love love my echo! I have one in the kitchen and 1 in the bedroom. Love getting weather, plays my favorite music, controls my smart devices & tells the best jokes!
Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working.
Finding new uses everyday. It's connected to my Nest thermostat, Harmony remote and Hue lights (yup, I'm a geek). Alexa even entertains my macaw with blues while I'm at work.
Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift.
Better than his last Kindle, camera is great addition
Is part of my family!!!We love my new Amazon echo. :)
Great device for children. Impressed by the specs.
Love my Amazon FireTv Stick. Bought one for my whole family.
I believe this' a great item, my sister has 1 and we liked it that's what prompt us to get one
Performs as described. Always reliable & dependable.
The echo was super easy to set up and start using. The whole family loves using the echo from playing music to getting trivia and a ton of other things.
Love being able to use Alexa unplugged. Amazing device!
I absolutely love this tablet!!! If I had bought this prior to buying my Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, I would have not purchased the e-reader at all, however it's nice to have just a designated e-reader device. The size is perfect! I am actually going to use this device instead of my 17" laptop to check my emails during the day.
My son loves this tablet. I would recommend for kids under teenage age. Great display, not much storage but can add SD card.
have a kindle with a broken screen. bought originally for 99.00. now regular price is 49.99 and were on sale black Friday for 34.99. got 2 more.
I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8.
This is a great tablet. It is reasonably priced and has great quality.
Got it for my 2 daughters for Christmas and they very happy
Maybe 5 stars, but it still won't clean my house! But I'm still learning. Hooked up some light with wifi smart plugs,....love it!!!!!!!!
My 15 year daughter love her gift, even when the apps are limited its good for the affordable price.
With no need for a tablet here, this was perfect!!! Love that the pages softly glow.
My grandson love it. Works great. Applications are good for education purposes.
Well worth the money..............................
Easy to use, not overpriced. You get what you pay for.
This was a graduation gift to my son, who is going to the 6th grade! He loves it, and so do I! He had a Samsung galaxy Tab and he loves the speed of the Kindle tablet!
I love this device. Small footprint, but tons of options.
We dropped our cable company and now have the fire stick . We are saving money and don't miss the cable company one bit!!!!
it does a lot LESS than you would expect. the advertisements is about all it does. no need to spend this large amount of money to listen to music you have on your phone. any info you get on the echo you get on your phone.
Bought it for our daughter and she loves it. Great for reading, playing games, and research.
Got this during the deal of the day for a great price. My son loves it and has downloaded plenty of games to keep him busy. Small enough to fit in my purse or a book bag and keep him busy while on car rides or in waiting rooms.
Bought this kindle mainly for my kids. There are plenty of games that my kids, and I, enjoy playing. Having the expandable memory slot was one of the reasons I purchased this model. Happy with my purchase....we have three of this model.
I reviewed many similar products to help with our cord cutting. For it's price and good reviews from many independent reviewers it is the best for the money and easy to set up and you. It has such a wide variety of apps, you can get more than what you get on cable for less.
Its very nice and not as big as the echo. Didn't know there was a Tap available to buy.
This is a great ereader. Very comfortable to hold. The screen has built in light sensor so that it adjusts to ambient light and is always easy to see. You can go from dark room to blazing sunlight and always have a very visible screen.
Have been very satisfied so far. Had one issue (had the device for 20 days) And It would not cut on...I reset the device and it has worked so far.
This was an upgrade from an older model. It works better in daylight.
My old kindle finally bit the dust after about 5 years or so. Had to run out to get a new one right away. Was sad that it cost so much now. My old one was about 1/3 the cost. Worth it for how much I use it.
I purchased this tablet for my nephew, and he loves it! It works great, and has everything he needs for not only reading but school work and entertainment!
Santa got this for my 7year old. Work's great . He plays, games, gets on hulu, and can play his school education learning games. Now he doesn't bother me to use my electronic devices .
The navigation on the tablet is easy to use. Its great for streaming movies. light weight and compact.
Kindle I like. This is the fourth one I have bought
Bought this for my 5yr and she loves it. We are still learning how to work it together, but so far so good.
The kindle was a gift and they are very happy with it. Purchasing it was a simple process.
Its a great starter tablet for my kids. They love it and the price was right
Gave as a gift and has been truly enjoyed by their whole family.
I purchased this for our kids for a road trip, we loaded some movies prior to the trip and I must say it was very quiet for once. At night I was able to use it to catch up on some reading. Nice tablet for the price.
Once you can figure out all the apps you can connect to the echo for entertainment you'll be set. But it wouldnt just play a song if you asked Alexa to play a song, she would say something like: it's not in your playlist, you need to update your Amazon acct or something to that extent. But...very entertaining...
A great device that has a variety of channels and many apps the have a lot of entertainment
We purchased 3 tablets before settling with this one. The parental controls are great, easy enough for my 4 year old to play on. Just bought another one for my 7 year old.
Primarily use as a music player. Voice recognition is a+++. Now I just have to figure out which devices I would like to control with Alexia (we use "echo"). Plenty of user created apps available to transfer results for commands like calendar and reminders to my smartphone so I don't have to depend on the Amazon smartphone app.
The product has limitless possibilities with wireless communication between lights, thermostats, and locks if desired.
The tablets are cheap and can do alot I've bought many cheap tablets before that weren't good
This device works as advertised. The voice command on the remote is the best I've seen. Worth every penny.
It's a very nice charger it's fast and effective.
I like the speed of the fire TV .I use to have a fire TV stick ,then upgraded to the fire tv: I'm very satisfied
Loved this tablet before. Happier now with lower price and expandable memory.
At Times, I Just Want To Look Things Up-Watch Things-News etc etc-It's Perfect-On the Go.
Alexa is awesome! My kids love asking her questions and to play their favorite songs , super quick responses too
great for the price, did research and found this #
Ive had the 1st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homepage isnt as friendly
This tablet is great. I purchased two for children at Christmas and they love it.
Great sound. Was surprised how good it sounds. Wife loves it, especially the avaliable music apps.
Fire 8 HD 2016 is great. Very easy to maneuver. Easy to use and transition from original Kindle Fire. Much more versatile than the original. Really glad I upgraded.
Easy set up, fun to use and sound quality is surprisingly good in our large open area.
The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
The Amazon Echo is a good product. The speaker system for playing music is good. It is not very load but it does fill the area with enough sound. The microphones on the system can pick up your voice from anywhere within range, as there a multiple speakers on the system. Once you have all your applications setup for Amazon Echo it is a very handy tool to have.
The voice recognition is very reliable. Very easy to use use and can easily understand the response. Unclear if maybe paid sponsors have an advantage over non paid sponsors. Some information or references could not be found. Looking forward to connecting more home solution to the unit.
Easy to set up and fun for all ages! Helpful info.
Already had an Echo DOT so I knew what I was getting. Rich sound with this full size speaker. Alexa very pleasant as usual
I went shopping on Black Friday just with plans to buy a GPS, then there was a display of the Amazon Fire tablets, people were grabbing them quickly, I grabbed four myself, I saved one for my wife and myself, two for presents. I use the tablet more than my laptop, this tablet is filled with games, an excellent camera, watch T.V. & Sports, reading Books, it comes with 8gb but it can handle up to 128gb.
This is the 5th Echo I have purchased, one for myself and the other 4 were gifts. The sound is awesome, does all the research for you. My grandson actually uses is when doing his homework. It's also great to use when having parties. One of my best purchases.
Great price. Easy start up easy to use.. large memory Great product
We are having so much fun with the Echo. Alexa plays our favorite music we've saved in our library…finds new songs, gives us news updates and weather reports. I know she does much more but we have not had the time to experiment…..The sound quality is great. After we bought ours, I bought a second one for a Christmas Gift.
My children requesting iPad mini's for Xmas ,and not ready to make an large expense at young ages of 9. The fire has been a great product and my children are happy and so is mom and dad.
This is an excellent device for streaming video. The only downfall, it's only wireless so you need a good wireless connection. Other than that, it's totally awesome. I would buy again.
This thing is awesome. I am learning more everyday
Parental controls are amazing and easy to use on this kindle.
This is very easy to use. Opened up so many show possibilities.
I've been spoiled by Apple. I bought the tablet for my son so he could have his own. He still uses his sister's iPod and iPad and they are years old.I would only recommend this to families that don't own apple products.
My grandchildren each received a Kindle fire and have downloaded books, and games best Christmas gift ever.
Like the echo for quick information, weather, travel, music. It was a gift for myself - love it
I had a lower end kindle for years. When that broke, I decide to buy the higher end one that is backlit. The back litghting is nice for reading at night. But the touch features are too jumpy--it jumps pages instead of just turning to the next one. It is cumbersome to buy through amazon and difficult to see the list of what you have. I don't know if I'd buy this one over the lowest end one again.
Great device and a GREAT price! Many apps available too!!!
this speaker is the coolest thing since sliced bread. you can ask her anything and she will answer you in 1 second and play any music you ask her to.
One of the best streaming devices out and at a affordable price
Probably one of my best purchase's for the price!!
Much better then our old nook reader in every fashion
This was a gift for my friend. My friend likes it, I wouldn't buy something like this for this much money. The screen is small.
The size is nice it's light weight no glare When outside in the day great for night reading too
This is a great tablet. There are thousands of books and movies and music to choose from the Amazon store. It is very easy to navigate
It works great. Bought for my wife for Christmas and our whole family loves it
Many features this tablet has and is a great price!
I got this for my 6 yr old grandbabie and she loves it. It is perfect for her needs
This is a great tablet and ereader together. Great for beginner's and all others my six year old son knows how to work this.
We wanted a tablet to take pictures and to access the internet. This product does both well.
love that i can request any music i want to hear!!
Excellent product for what it does. Spouse loves it!Nough said!
It is easy to install and upgrade. Love the clarity
Best tablet I have had load up fast and camera is awesome
I bought a firestick for every television in my house. I can watch whatever I want and it also decreases my cable bill.
This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing
Bought a 2 blacks, blue & orange. These tablets are amazing & awesome price. i would like to purchase the prurple one for myself.
the kids use it every chance they get, this is the fourth one we have bought.
This fun device has changed our viewing habit. The diversity is great.
I bought these for my niece and nephews for Christmas. They love them! They know how to turn them on and locate an app. I love being able to set time limits so they aren't on their tablets very often! Great investment!
This is our second Amazon Fire TV. They are great and we've never had any issues with it. We really love the Amazon Prime membership as well.
If you are fan of iOS and iPad then you will not like this product. I prefer to give it to either kids who want to play and watch videos or people who loves to read( only if they Amazon prime account).
I didn't want something that was always monitoring room conversations. This appears to only listen when I tap it, and that is much more acceptable to me. Works great. :-)
I bought this for my parents for Christmas. They loved it. It's funny to see your 60-something parents playing with such new technology. From my daughter who is four years old to my parents that are in their sixties good for everyone
Set it up for my husband and he loves it. Was a great value for product.
Bought it for my wifes Yoga Training Course.So much cheaper than buying all the paperback books she needed, and she loves it!Cheaper books, music, emails.. What more do you need?
Bought this item as a present for my college-age son. Didn't know much about kindles, but my research led me to this model. May not have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive version, but it is suiting him just fine. Easy to use and read, good size. I'm pleased he's pleased!
Purchased as a gift for my 10 year old and she loves it. Perfect size, detailed graphics, good battery life for those long road trips, and a SD card slot is a sweet bonus.
The color is what got me and the features was on point. The screen shows a lot of different displays. To share for now until the next one.
I decided on purchasing instead of the name brands
Very functional, easy set-up and great so be quality.
Happy that I made this purchase and will recommend it....can't be beat cause I only paid $40
I purchased two of these tablets to replace all the other brands that stopped working within a two month period. So far so good! It's a perfect fit for my two younger children. And I feel you can't beat the price for a Fire. I have control on what they access. The only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose. When charging I have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stays in the unit.
We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!
Great for a first tablet. Needed something larger than my phone and it comes in handy when the grandkids visit.
I bought this for my dad this Christmas. Once I set it up for him and he's figured out how to use it, he loves it. (He's 58) He uses it to play on the Internet and read so he doesn't need anything with too many extra gadgets. But it's customizable enough to add apps and games if he wants them.
This tablet is limited in functionality but it gets the job done, especially for the price
Love the fire tablets! I have 4 of them and they are all amazing. My kids love them
Bought 2 during Black Friday, great for the price! Don't expect it to be an iPad but for regular use and price, you can't beat it!
For the price this is a great tablet. I've had the Fire HD6 with a better screen but the 7 has a SD slot for more memory. Screen resolution between the two is very similar while viewing movies and tv.
Awesome reader. Great light control to read in bed at night within waking your Partner.
If you are an avid reader, then this is a must have.
Needed a tablet for games and apps for the elderly. Great choice
The KINDLE VOYAGE is a wonderful product and I use it everyday for my reading. I take it to lunch and dinner each day.
This really isn't a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck. I bought this for about $35 just to kill time on a couple of long flights so I didn't wear out the battery on my phone. I definitely wouldn't recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at. I only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so I got what I wanted out of it.
Fun for the first few days, but we hardly use it now after figuring out it can't answer many of our queries.
Bought this tablet for my 4 year old and also one for my father. Both are able to use this for their own purposes and are very happy. Price is good, especially since kids tend to be a bit rough with electronics. Plus for profile creation and restricting access to features from kids.
I love this speaker. It does everything you could ever imagine. Love the fact that I can order something from amazon by just talking to Alexa.
Still a great device even though it's a little older than the Voyage and Oasis. Perfect for reading at night and has great resolution. Love it!
Bought this for my other tv which has an Amazon fire tv stick, world of difference as the fire tv is so much faster, buffering no problem
I've had two previous generations of Kindles, but always found myself longing for the old hardcover. No more... This is perfect for my needs. Can read outside or in a darkened room. For approximately $100, it can't be beat.
My husband loves it. He is definitely reading more since he got it!
I've had my eye on the Echo for a few months now. I didn't realize Best Buy had got them in stock until I was discussing with the sales person. I decided to give it a try. Set up was so easy. The voice recognition has been excellent. Alexa hears and appropriately responds to all of my requests, as well as my husband's. It really comes in handy in the mornings, as I can request news and entertainment while getting ready for the day. I can review my daily schedule, adjust it, make lists and so much more. Integration with IFTTT works great. The amount of easily available content is wonderful. While I don't have any smart devices such as lights or thermostats yet, I am planning for them, and will be able to use the Echo to control them.
The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite was a gift to my husband. He is very happy with it for several reasons. Reading from the non-reflective screen is effortless, and he can adjust the size of the characters. He can take notes and highlight parts of the text. Two really neat features are: 1. If you take notes on a book that you borrowed from the library, those notes will still be there even after you return the book. So, if you happen to borrow the same book a few weeks later, when you open the book on your e-reader, your notes will be there. 2. In a complicated story with lots of characters, the e-reader keeps track of who is who. In a paper book, you would have to flip the pages back and forth to figure that out. No need to do this with the e-reader.
I would recommend this anytime as it's a great product it's
Great reader and tablet enjoy the video graphics nice unit.
Great value with a lot of capabilities and available aps. This was purchased to be my 13 yr olds first 'grown up' computer of her own. She is very satisfied.
Quality of screen display is lacking and the reason I returned the tablet. For adult users I cannot recommend.
Bought the two tablets for two of my younger grandkids. So far the tablets have held up well. My daughter likes having the ability to limit what the kids can use the tablets for.
I enjoy my kindle tv, it beats paying for cable every month ☺️
When I purchased the Kindle, I was doing a lot of travel. It was great having access to material that had been downloaded prior to leaving.Great item for all ages.
This product is amazing -- plays music-- gives definitions--spells-- answers questions on any subject--weather reports--news reports etc. etc. etc.
You get what you pay for Was not to happy but for a 3 year old it's ok
It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
Great tablet. It came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kids. Our daughter is 2 and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps. Also the case keeps the tablet protected and it's pretty tough with good grip. Well worth the money.
I am so happy with this purchase. I no longer have a cable or satellite bill to pay every month. Saves me $160 a month. Easy to use once you learn
Went into your store to purchase Echo. You were out of them. Ordered one on Amazon and it was here in 2 days.
Great for kids. Simple and inexpensive. 16G must better than 8G
I love this device more then I thought I would. It's slim and lightweight. Fits very nicely into my small purse. The resolution is great. I really like the built in light. I do miss the built in keyboard I had on my previous Kindle but I'm OK with that. It does not have the speaker either but I never used them to begin with. The key things for me were the price, resolution, font and built in light. This device met all my requirements. Additionally, I purchase all my electronics from Best Buy and have loved the service I have received each and every time. They have truly earned my continued loyalty.
I love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which I don't because I have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups
Works excellent with Playstation's VUE service. Pushes Amazon content pretty hard so if you don't have a PRIME membership it may get annoying. Ditched cable and picked up the FireTV box, couldn't be happier.
I know not everyone wants to read a direct comparison to an Apple TV rather than a review on the moerits of this device, but I have owned both and stuck with the Apple TV instead of this.The Apps I used (DirecTV Now, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video) choked and buffered much more often, or froze completely. The wifi reception was also sub par.The remote is good, and I prefer the batteries approach to Apple's rechargeable one. Everything else though, the Apple TV seemed to do better.My two cents. Still a solid streaming device, and the price is better than Apple's. I would make the decision based on how plugged into Amazon's ecosystem you are vs. Apple's.
Does everything you need and for $50! It includes banner adds but they are not at annoying frequency.
I needed something for a young kid and this tablet was suggested to me from a sales person at Best Buy. The kid loves it.
it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need
Something the family always wanted. Got it as a gift for my wife. Works good. But occasionally pick up conversations. Not to thrilled about that.
The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e-books, and watch your videos.
I really enjoy reading and on my iPad was hurting my eyes. This Kindle really works great.
It work just as good as the tablets that cost much more. If you take care of it it will last a long time.
Great size and storage for reading my online books
I have a pretty fast and stable internet connection, 65Mbps down.So when I tried to stream some 4K content, it kept buffering to the point that it just wouldn't load the video anymore. Even streaming 1080p content had some issues. So i used the dedicated apps on my tv to see if I had the same problem, nope. It worked flawlessly! This product just plain sucks.
I bought this initially as an alarm clock. I have now loaded it with a lot of skills. I am enjoying using it for tasks and fun.
setting up was easy. no issues watching it or set up
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. Purchased at Christmas time for $59. It's an even better value if you have an Amazon Prime account. Only downside is the use of Amazon's Appstore instead of the Google play store which has more variety.
Great tech works well highly recommended no issues
A great ebook reader which is easy to read in sunlight and can be dimmed right down at night so it doesn't disturb my wife. Top menu can be a bit confusing but on the whole all user friendly.
At first I thought it would be just another one of the voice interfaces that are on a lot of devices - It only comes with a few functions. Wow I never was so happy to be proved wrong. The omni-directional microphones and excellent sound alone make it a great choice to add to your home. Because of its open source code you can add skills that other users have developed or download a SDK and make your own. It reads me bedtime stories filters my content for news sources according to my whim add complex sums, spells and is an all around good sport. But the best thing is -- I had a few remote control hubs around wink, nest the house because I hoped they would make my life easier only to find the they cell phone user interface made it much more cumbersome than completing the task myself. Echo changed all that it unified my security, locks, my lights and more through an easy voice interface -- I could not be more happy - it gave me more than a smart house - it gave me a smart home. I even bought a second unit to take on vacation- Definitely will change your life for the better
My mom loves this More space and functions very well!
I enjoy this device. Something new to continually ask Alexa. The speakers are great, easy to pair, easy to use and set up.
Does everything we expected! Great for the price. Had it over a month now and no problems. I'd recommend it!
I bought this as a gift for my father to use to replace his now dated Sony e-reader, and he loves it. He loves the fact it has a back light and can be read in the dark, and even said he reads way faster on it than before. He no longer falls asleep while reading. As an added bonus he's able to check the ESPN app and more. What a great affordable buy!!!
Had a gen 1 Kindle and so glad I moved up to this. Great for outdoor sunny reading. A must have !
Good tablet. Need to buy a pink case for it. I bought it for my daughter
Not only does what Siri does, but it takes it one step further by completing tasks that you ask it to do, like ordering pizza or ubers, which I do plenty of. With extra devices hooked to lights in your home, for example, you can ask Echo to turn your lights on, dim them, etc., before entering the home. This can be a real safety feature.
My daughter loves it!! Great color, light weight, rubber cover for protection.
I have had an echo for a couple of years and absolutely love it, so when I saw them on sale, I decided to buy one for my classroom. They are well worth the price!
Love it! A perfect tablet with a 128gb expandable storage
If you can jail break it. It will be a nice product
I am enjoying the many capabilities this product offers!
This tablet is great for on the go. A good size for reading, game playing, and web surfing.
I love this kindle and price is awesome .My Three year boy love to play it.
Excellent reader. We have Amazon Prime and access to a number of books with Amazom. Plus we utilize our local library. This paperwhite is excellent for reading at anytime. Good battery life.If you only need a reader, you can not buy a better one. If you want more, look at the Kindle Fire tablet. Good price.
This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can't beat the price overall.
this fire was for my daughter for her birthday she loves it
I enjoy my new Kindle as a back up device. It does everything a desk top computer could do for me including, email, social media, and a search engine.It also easily travels with me everywhere.
I want to get more automated items to hook up with alexa
Great tablet for beginner, especially with wifi function and ebook purposes
I love my device but wish there was more of a descriptive summary of how to get music stations and as well as other features. I've learned most by just coming upon things. Needs better operating instructions
The only concern is there is no filter on free apps. Also the parental control password is a bit cumbersome and enforcing on too many option rather than just not allowing new financial purchases.
This product was a great one, and the tablet does everything I wanted it to. Some of the websites I go to don't open but other than that it is great I love it.
very fast and kid friendly for my young son gifts.
Excellent for timers, wake up alarms, reminders, adjusting the temperature on my echobee thermostat, control my lighting etc...
Exactly what I wanted. Far faster & better than a Firestick-- the Fire TV rocks.
I had to buy it, what else is there to say.
Accomplishes the tasks of a bigger tablet at a much lower price.
Bought this for my 3 year old and she loves it, it's perfect for her and if it breaks it wasn't an expensive device! Well worth it
Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine.
I like the kindle it is light and easy too sue battery life is good.
Buying this device I thought it could replace my phone which my kids love to use to watch their videos. It's great with applications but it's limited when it comes to kids video outside of Amazon's store.
Its awaesome. I love it. The price is worth it to buy it.
I like this item because it has an eathernet port and is very fast .
I had an original version of these 5 years ago. I never used it then but have been reading more lately. I figured it was cheap enough lets give it a go- it has been amazing. I live in Hawaii so I bring it to the beach and read constantly. The back light it perfect for night reading. The only weird thing about this is that it saves all of your highlighted areas in one document, but it gives the full citation for each underlined part, which makes it extremely useful (if you read different books, but unnecessarily tedious. But either way, great feature.
I've only had one box failure since I cut the cable cord years ago and Amazon stood by replacing it because it was an odd occurrence. I have several of these -- they work great not only with Amazon features, but with Hulu, Netflix and other streaming media options. I tried a Roku unit from a friend once and didn't like it. The Fire TV, on the other hand, is very easy to use.
Went from paper white to fire for color and audio. Love the fire.
I expected the drag to be worse. It really isn't..
Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.
fast loading no buffering on the best price on market for streaming.
I purchased this item not to play games, but to use as a search tools and read newspapers and books . Works perfectly. Great Price for Xams.
I managed to make 4 kids very happy this Christmas with each getting their very own tablet! Great for gaming, emailing, streaming music & videos!
Love to use it everyday. Inside light is useful at night
This tablet is a great price. Perfect for those who use Amazon and want to use Amazon apps.Don't let the low price and screen size fool you. Works flawlessly. It has long battery life and a bright display. This is a must-have item for $50.
This cover is a must have for your Kindle reading device. I purchased a different case initally and had to come back to get this case. It is so handy to close when reading so your screen is always protected. The Kindle is secure/locked into the case so you don't have to worry about it falling. If you buy a Kindle you MUST this case!
Nice for music and home automation control. Used ha-bridge to call home genie api uri's.
I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though.
Many options. Bye bye cable. Happy family, happy kids.
This device is amazingly! I got one as a gift and knew I had to gift one back!! So glad I no longer have to shuffle through my music! I can just ask Alexa and the song is played!! Great product!! 10**********
I cut my cable. Easy to use, easy to install. My son did it for me, but I could have by myself.
Got this on sale for 69, decent display but you can tell it is not on par with other tablets. It is great if you have prime and use their services. Great speakes, makes a huge difference in Audio quality. Battert life is good, no complaints. I gave it 4 stars due to the play store access. There is a way around it, I do have it on here now but it took some work.
I am very happy getting this as a gift. I have had a blast getting acquainted with Alexa!!!
This is my second kindle fire. The 6th gen is an even better experience. Glad I preordered.
This does everything I would ask of it. No complaints.
Upgraded from dot to echo. Sound quality is great. So many things you can do with this gadget!
Kids love it. Easy setup was ready with in minutes
Great tablet for kids. The free replacement policy is great as well. Does take a bit of effort to set up, but pretty easy for the kids to use.
Many great features but the speaker does not meet expectations. I also have a google home. I ended up putting the google home in the living room because the sound was Better and put the Echo in the bedroom. I would also think it would be nice to have a plug to attach a speaker. You can use blue tooth but if your going to use a dedicated speaker to improve sound it would be nice to have the option.
I'll update this after Christmas but I read many reviews when purchasing ANYTHING. Surprised to having read about many problems with the Fire 8. That's why I'm going with the reliable 7. Its a good starting tablet for the wife and she mentioned it to me. Went with the higher storage 16gb over 8 even though you can buy micro sd cards up to 128gb now. Picked up a case at BB (1/2 price) and a micro sd (32gb).Just wait till Christmas morn now
Easy to read on and awesome battery life. Great price.
Loveeeeeeeee........................................
But like a lil kid sometimes she/Alexa doesn't here me.
awesome gift and perfect for kids or older adults easy to use
It is pretty good for the price. Good for a young teen or someone who does light web browsing or plays light games.
this was such a super deal i bought 2. they work very well and you could not beat the price. i would definately recommend to a friend
Great for reading. Good starter device. Would recommend to someone else
Easy to setup. Up and running in no time.Very helpful to have.
Bought two as gifts for our daughters. Thought since they recently started to read books again and would buy the actual books or try to read them on their phones, it would make a perfect gift. They love to be able to download books from Amazon and be able to use it as a tablet with tons of entertainment at their fingertips.
Good for beginners. Wanted something simple and that's what I got
The Fire TV is by far the best streaming platform around. Amazon has done an outstanding job.
Amazon Echo is a very good product for what it is supposed to do. It understands what you speak and does quite a few neat tricks. Setting it up is quite easy even for a novice. A thing to be desired is that it is not integrated with itunes and only with Amazon. This is a major drawback for me. You can connect your devices to it via bluetooth as workaround but that again is a additional process to undertake. I like it though and I am sure these minor things would be there in future.
Less lag than the stick. Ethernet port option is nice. Not too much need though if you wont use extensively. If your a passive user go stick, if you'll everyday and even want to do gaming go box.
I like the tablet. My 6 year old daughter is able to download lots of games and she loves it!!
Great tablet for my 4 and 8 year old.... kid friendly, safe, and mom and dad enjoy it as well! Love that it comes in a protective case. Reasonably priced for a great tablet the kids love!
I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose.
I would recommend this to anyone that loves watching movies.
I got this for my mother who loves it. If you have Amazon Prime, then it lets you listen to your Prime Music anywhere with just a voice command. Fantastic!
this Kindle is much faster and has significantly brighter screen than my first generation product. Wish I had purchased it sooner!
I like it and it really does well, that said even though it is Android it is dedicated to only allow you to go through Amazon and not Google play.
Too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.
Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good
SO simple and easy to u se. It answers a multitude of questions and plays my favorite music. Portable and unobtrusive when not in use.
Love the new light feature added. since 1st generation
I have my Alexa in the kitchen on counter, and it is fun to ask questions about weather, sing songs and about recipes. I bought 2 of these, 1 for me and 1 for my neighbor, we both LOVE it! It's fun to speak out loud and interact with Alexa. Thanks for making a great product Amazon!!
Awesome!! Keeps my life in order and helps me with my Amazon shopping. Her jokes are a little lame but entertaining.
Good solid tablet with ability to use mcSD cards at a great price. Only down side is Amazon interface restricts full android platform.
Bought it for my 3 year old daughter and she loves it. Get purchase!!!
The price was right and just what my husband needed. Easy to use and setup.
This product is easy to use and take along with you
this was a gift. My dad loves it! It does exactly what he needed it for with a great price!
I was using another brand, from another vendor. Problematic. Continuation of reading erratic. When I began to attempt to read where I left off last, unit would take me back to random page or completely start the book over. Went through 2 readers, and both were faulty and very frustrating. The last stopped taking a charge. I read very good reviews of the Kindle. Pitched the other two (and they weren't cheap). The Kindle holds a charge for weeks not days and selection and price are light years ahead of the other service. Recommended to a friend and she loves it.
it was a good price and works well. I would recommend a case.
Got this item during a sale and absolutely love it. It is a lot of fun and easy to use.
pros - light compact bright fast response from touch screencons- hard to navigate. I use my old kindle with buttons to browse. This kindle can be frustratingwith its overly sensitive touch screen.Overall a very good reader but no need to purchase if happy with paperwhite versions. For someone new to kindle it is worth the price as long as have another electronic device to browse the kindle site.
The Kindle Paperwhite is light and I love the backlight. It's great for basic reading
They have come a long way since I purchased the first kindle Fire. It's a worthy successor and a very good tablet for the budget conscience person.
Outstanding value, for the price I paid on Black Friday ($33), this tablet does all of the functions I use my expensive iPad for (light web browsing, email, videos, books).Sure its not as fast and the display isn't as sharp, but its less than 10% of the price of an iPad 2.
My wife initially talked me into this. I love it! Shopping lists, tasks, music, news, stock market,and on and on!! Well worth it and you have someone that talks to you, only when spoken to!! That is worth more than you can imagine! Highly recommend it!
I love this kindle. Faster than the paper white in how it responds to changing pages and/or books. The self adjusting light levels works very good in mine. Having the option on the frame to change pages is great but you have to press a little hard on the forward page button or it will do a backward change instead; this is the only reason why I don't give it a 5.I love this reader
Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.
Good quality tablet. This tablet could be a bit more user friendly but once u get going by pushing a view apps you can find most of what your looking for.
We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it's easy to work.
This tablet from Amazon is decent. The performance of the tablet is de end too.
Returned it in 2 days. Digital assistants have a long way to go.
bought this as a friend to help her move from an ancient laptop to a simple tablet. The "value" of this product is very high.
Speaker system for music play is great. Very sensitive to her name "Alexa". Make sure to disable voice purchasing or place a code if she will be in a room with a television.. there are lots of commercials where her name is called. She will respond.
Easy to set it up, and it's paying for itself because I'm cancelling some cable channels
The Kindle I purchased is a good and expensive tablet useful for reading and internet. It does have a lot of apps already loaded that I do not plan to use and do not know how to delete. I mainly use the Kindle Fire for Facebook and occasionally get on the internet.
This is great I was used to just the plain Kindle and this feels more like a tablet than just a kindle. I use it to check email, do pintrest and read my books. Totally in love with my new Kindle fire!
great product...will buy again...like it's versility and ease of use
its good product but it has a big problem , the battery is the big issue for this device.
I bought this after being an avid Apple fan for the last 10 years. I had old style two Apple TV's and even bought a new Apple TV to help with me cutting the cord to DirectTV after 11 years. I switch to using the Apple TV with the DirecTV Now streaming service. After the Apple TV would no longer let friends or family airplay to it because of new updates or let me load any third party apps I knew it was time to switch. It was a great switch to the Fire TV and I have not looked back. I have been able to load numerous apps that are not available on the Apple TV such as Showbox and Kodi. My biggest complaint was the Fire TV remote was not able to control the volume on my sound bar like the Apple TV remote and was not able to turn my TV or sound bar on or off. The Sideclick remote was exactly what I needed. I was able to program the remote to control power and sound level, along with change the input on the TV. I would highly recommend using the Fire TV.Pros:Works extremely wellAllows 3rd party app installationMuch cheaper than Apple TVAllows use of amazon music which Apple TV did notCons:Home page is not at visually pleasing as the Apple TVRemote does not have volume controlsRemote is not touch sensitive and has a very loud *click* noise when pushing buttons.
The speed the great. The Kindle Fire has a lot of apps to choose from and has not frozed on me yet. Once you figure out the Parental Control, it works great with unwanted charges.
We still have one of the original Kindles, and the upgraded features on the new Kindle are great: being able to change the brightness, able to read it in the dark, seeing page numbers in addition to % completed. This Kindle seemed easier to use and more intuitive than the original.
Very good tablet at a great price. Nice size for all applications.
Gave this as a gift. The receiver loved it and uses it all the time. I personally have an older Kindle, and I was jealous of the updates and find it to be much more like a tablet than the older Kindle Fires.
I got this tablet for my dad after his old tablet bit the dust. He loves it! Great tablet and features!
Lives up to all the positive comments that I found online. I have not encountered any of the negative issues mentioned in the reviews.
We listen to Echo every day! Great Amazon music. All types of music. Working on it turning my lights on and off.
Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .
This item is no good... will only last for 3 months & amazon basically tells you to f*** off
I was looking for just the right e reader for my wife"s birthday. She loves to read in bed before she falls a sleep and her old one did not light up so she would struggle to try and read in the dark and use whatever little beam of light she could to be able to read while I slept and with this one it is not even a problem any more the screen lights up and she can easily read while I am sound a sleep.
My wife has an older paperwhite that still functions very well. We decided to get this one for my daughter because she's a book worm. It's worked great and she loves it.
Love this little tablet. My 5 year old will leave my iPad alone now!! Apps work great and sound is awesome!!
I have had my Echo for 4 weeks. I actually got it up and running without any help. It is just fun to have. The grand children love it too.
I love this product,echo. Easy to use and the direction is simple to understand, I don't recommend children to use it, it's voice activated and if a child doesn't speak clearly the echo will pick up words similar to what they're trying to say and the echo may give inappropriate info based on the sound of the word. Speak clearly when using it. This is not a toy for young children.
Too many advertisements to get through. A little tough to adjust to coming from the apple world.
was skeptical about the small size but a few minutes of checking it out showed me that this is a great little tablet. gave as a gift and she loves it. portable and great display.
Awesome little device.. use it to control zwave lights with voice ... sometimes it has a hard time picking up my voice but other than that it is awesome
Easy access to book reader. Love watching my Netflix.Con - Slow getting on Internet.
The tablet is great for only $50 but certainly not the most touch responsive. It feels a little slow to me. It also irked me that you have to pay extra to remove the ads from the lock screen.
This product has been so thoroughly reviewed that I won't repeat the obvious in any detail. It's great for reading under all conditions -- sharp typefaces and, of course, illuminated. Two small issues: 1. in dim light conditions the light at the bottom of the screen is a bit uneven. There are slightly darker areas just above each of the four lights that illuminate the screen. This does not bother me and it isn't noticeable in a brightly lit environment. More annoying is the fact that the Search function doesn't work with some books: for those, searching brings up no results, no matter what I enter. I have the same books on my Kindle Keyboard and have to use that to find what I'm looking for. I haven't contacted Amazon about this, but it seems odd. On other books, it works as expected. One other thing to keep in mind if you have an older Kindle is that it will need to be recharged more frequently, given that it's illuminated. Overall, I like this reader as the display is excellent, it's easy to hold, and page-turn and other navigation features all work well. If it weren't for the problem with searching, I'd give it five stars.
I had 2 Fire Sticks and bought this FireTV to begin streaming PlayStation Vue. It's much faster than the other streaming devices I have and the whole family enjoys using it.
Good bye cable! This works great. I wish I would have purchased sooner.
Purchased two for my 9 year old girls. They love them and I love the fact that there are so many parental controls.
Can do everything the regular kindles can do, but in full color. My Wife loves it and is always reading magazines and watching movies.
I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.
A wonderful tablet for kids, and an excellent price point for grandma! He's very happy.
The Fire TV with quad-core processor is significantly faster than the older dual-core. Makes using streaming a breeze!
My grandson loved this. He is 4 and it was perfect.
I love my kindle, it's easy to navigate through the pages and apps. More people friendly than I imagined.
Purchased this for my neighbor and their kids and they love it!! The kids enjoy and have endless hours of fun by simply speaking to the Alexa and they cannot believe it speaks back or answers their questions! We have enjoyed this product very much!
Streams great, I love using Alexa to play almost any song I can think of and the interface from the remote is very easy and reliable.
this is a great tablet for the price, works a lot like an ipad I would recommend it
Bought this for our son. Works great for what we needed it for. Just wish the volume was a little better, but overall good product.
Compact and very versatile, really very useful to keep things up to date
Easy way for my family to stream music and videos over our speakers. APPs are a hassle a lot of the time and limited storage capacity.
The kids program option are great. Don't like that I have to register tablet in order to buy anything though.
This is my 2 nd Echo purchase. I have had one for awhile. This was for my daughter. We love Alexa. She is in our kitchens and helps with everything; recipes, kid chore list, grocery list, music, weather, timer, story teller, the list is endless. She gets confused occasionally but she is usually still amusing. We are all glad she became part of our family.
I am very satisfly with product and service provide
Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good as it is on my tab s2 9.7 in but this is about $200 cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my books and the tab s2 was not doing it for me
Unlike the fire stick, this item does not over heat.
It is easy to use without having to read the instructions.
Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want.
I brought this for my nephew(6). He loves it does everything that the high dollar tablets do but at a fraction of the the cost. A very good buy!!!
I got this kindle after the kids had been at their grandma's around tons of iPads. They were just as happy with these...
I gave the echo to two of my friends. They were impressed with Alexa and her instant answers to any questions that were asked. They also liked the instant access to music from Amazon Prime
The first thought came into my mind after getting Kindle Paperwhite that why I didn't buy this thing earlier! It is an awesome device. I really didn't think that a digital device can fill up the space of a physical book. Highly recommended.
Like it. Worth the 50 $ just wish it only had a real Google play store
This is our second Kindle. We got this one because it is significantly better for reading in the sun. Our old Kindle didn't work well outdoors. We are VERY pleased with this new one.
Love the new 4K Amazon box .. Looks great on my tv
HAD THE AMAZON FIRE TV BOX FOX 1 WEEK AND IT BROKE
Bought this for my 4 years old granddaughter and she loves it. It has all the books, apps, videos that she needs to learn and play. I love it cause she plays on it and leaves mine alone ☺. It has everything on it and I can set parental guides. Best buy ever! !
Cool little device that tells you almost anything you want to know. Music sounds good as well!
My 5 year old son loves his kindle. He can fully work it himself. We love all the he age appropriate games, learning apps, and books. The case is great for all those accidentally drops.
We bought this for our son and he loves it. He can read his books and also play games on it.
this tablet is excellent i use it on the couch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it
Great for beginners, I had one and then I got my stepson one.
So slow, camera not good, very low quality of picture.. Get Apple iPad mini instead.
I am shocked at the super low price for a very functional and handy tablet. Easily the best tablet on the market under $50!
I am really enjoying it !! Love it ! Sales person was also great
The amazon fire hd8 is awesome! Easy to navigate, color is beautiful
It's big then the one I had I would tell my friends
I bought this electronic reader because I was tired of the glare I got from reading on my iPad in the sun. It's perfect! Very light and easy for travel, and the screen actually looks like the page of a book.
The Amazon Fire tablet its self I give a 4, I thought it had the Google Play Store on it and the kids couldn't find the games & stuff they wanted But my youngest loves it! Walking him through the whole process ( after the other kids tried it out I did a system restore back to factory settings) I liked it and so did my son! So all in all I think 4 Fits well!
Bought two of these for gifts for our parents. Very easy to use. Good size.
For wife, she likes it. Good to read and play games on
Can't beat the price these are going for, gets the job done.
I read often and love this e-reader. I previously had a nook and liked it, but it was old and did not have night reading option. The voyage is light and easy to hold. The backlighting is great at night. Overall very happy with this product for reading.
Received on time, and works great . I think this is a great product. And thanks for your customer service.
I have not been a fan of anything Android, but Amazon did this one right. I've had none of the issues I've experienced with other Android tablets, and it works great for shopping, browsing, reading, and listening to music.
I didn't even know I wanted it until I was in line and saw it for 30$. Could pass it up! I think I paid more for the case for it. I gave it 1 less star because it doesn't have all of the apps and games I like. Otherwise works great and u can use a memory card.
I bought this for a friends daughter and she loves it she is 10.
Great product! I'm oversees and wanted it for kodi
Excellent tab ; originally struggled to get it into the web but discovered that we have to connect to Hot Spot from mobile phone ( not open wifi in public place)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gave this tablet to a friend as a Xmas gift and they love it. Easy to use and the size is perfect!
First time with anything like Alexa and still trying to figure out all her features. Kids love to ask her questions but she doesn't connect to as many apps as I would like and doesn't connect with my Apple products (calendar, music playlists, etc). Wish I'd realized that sooner but still enjoy listening to podcasts & Audible books. She has great sound quality for music as well.
This is an incredible product that works like a dream. You will want to add this to your TV Entertainment. It's well worth the money.
So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
My wife likes it. She reads a lot so she uses it all the time. Also likes to go online with it.
Bought it for my mom so we can stay in touch and she could play crossword games or Bingo at her Nursing home. She needs alot of assistance
The Kindle Fire's are a great product to own. We own 2 and our whole family enjoys them. Easy to use.
It is a very good E-Reader, battery lasts for weeks.
Works very well for my new Kindle.
I've been wanting a Kindle Paperwhite for a while, putting off buying some books I want to read because I didn't want to be carrying all that weight with me when I'm traveling. I'm so glad I finally got it! I loaded the books on, and it's been really easy to use. The controls are intuitive, and the light is great. Easy to use, easy to read on it.
Other members in my family had a Kindle Fire, and I saw how great it worked so I got one. I love it.
Well priced. Easy to operate. Fast and efficient. Great product.
So good I bought 2 of them. Super fast and tons of movies to choose from
Pros - weight is super light, small size, long battery, I fell it to floor a few times and screen didn't breakCons - it takes half second for the next page to appear on screen when turning pages, similar to "fade in" animation in PowerPoint. I would prefer more seemless appearance of next page.
Love that it is voice controlled and is very easy and you can operate stuff here at my house
Does everything I asked of my Kindle - I read and play games - but also does so much more if you need to, including taking photos. A very cost-effective little tablet.
It is light and easy to carry. I can read books everywhere now.
Just got my kindle and am just getting use to it. Like it so far.
I cannot wait to link my house to this device. I'm only using the factory settings and am thoroughly impressed.
So easy to use anywhere there is an outlet. I had a charger that would work,so I debated about buying this. I'm so glad I did.
It was a fast deliver, the tablets is awsomo and it's a great service
Purchased this for my wife as she is the reader in the family. Perfect is what she says. With Amazon prime even better with a selection of free books.
Seems smaller than the older version but it still does the job. User friendly.
Great tablet for a beginner to catch up on reading.
Wife wanted something better for her reading and this was Perfect!
Great Tablet for children...comes pre-loaded with lots of applications for loads of entertainment for younger children. It also comes with a 2 year warranty at time of purchase.
We're happy with Alexa. We shuttle it from place to place without a problem. I just had higher expectations but we still enjoy it.
I am not very tech savvy. But, in no time I was using my new Fire tablet. It is, very basic, but, I mostly use it for e-mail, facebook and browsing the internet. Good buy for the money.
A great price for an e-reader with a great battery life. Love the e-ink too.
Great value, just the right size and weight. Suits my needs perfectly. Performs very well. Easy to get accessories to fit.
When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead
Purchased Amazon Fire TV due to previous reviews stating that it performs fast with PlayStation Vue. Tried it out for a month and all it did was constantly buffer. Checked my internet speed and router/modem and I have the fastest 1GB speed available. Reviews on PlayStation Vue state that Roku interface is not as good, so I purchased Amazon Fire Stick to determine if it has better performance. Love the Amazon Fire Stick. Extremely fast and no buffering with online streaming with PlayStation Vue on the Amazon Fire Stick. Save your money and get the stick.
first Android tablet I have owned and I liked enough to taste the android marketplace and OS. Runs smooth and snappy display. All the Amazon apps, plus you can download the Google Play Store and have a choice between the two. Overall, definitely worth the money and neat media player if nothing else. And can't beat it for the money spent
I bought this as a gift and my wife enjoys using this new kindle fire. we have had the original version of the kindle tablet and this new version works quicker and more efficiently. Happy with the kindle tablet!!
I was confused between Amazon fire and Kindle when buying this as both were in the same price range. But i would say that i made the right choice by picking the specialized Kindle reader. This is the closest experience to actual book-reading and sometimes even more convenient. Would definitely recommend.
How can you complain about anything this food for this cheap?
I got a kindle fire when they first came out. Time to update and great choice, good graphic, great for catching up on your favorites show better than watching on a phone!!
My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective.
I love this!! I have the Apple TV also but find the amazon fire tv easier to navigate
Simple to use and my kids pove it. Too bad the unit has so much Ad's
kids love it and i like it because it has child proof qualities.
Bought it for a gift. I do not know what else to say!
I like to read in bed and find the Kindle so light that I can read much longer without getting tired of holding it.
I have to confess, I am sure this thing is being underutilized. It is great for weather, Flash Briefings, and other pieces of information. IFTTT? Raspberry Pi? People tell me things they can do and I'm like, "Hey, I'm getting Philips Hue to work. That's about as advanced as I'm going right now." Nevertheless, I do enjoy being able to call up my music from Amazon Prime Music, order pizza, and switch between my account and my wife's. Seriously enjoying it.
Absolutely LOVE my Echo! Sound is much louder than I expected it to be so it's very easy to hear!! Great for playing music and she'll play anything you want to hear!! The shopping list feature is awesome and the fact that it goes right to my phone so I can check it at the store is great!! Highly recommend!!
The Kindle Paperwhite is an improvement over older generation Kindle's with it's clearer display, cleaner font, and built-in light. It's an e-reader that anyone can use with very little technical capability and makes for an enjoyable reading experience.
This is a great option for a first tablet. It's lightweight and user friendly.
Great device for cable cutters. I just wish it had vudu.
Great inexpensive product for the price. Just like the Kindle Fire HDX except for no mayday function. Both front and rear cameras are a plus. Love the Amazon kindle fire
it is nice item my grandchildren enjoy playing with
This is a good tool to use... I however, would suggest that you upgrade to the better version.. I did, and I like it much better.
Great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.
I love the Amazon Fire. I am able to play all my movies and shows on my fire. It's great!
We use our Amazon Echo daily for music, shopping and to do lists, timers, and the weather. Because the Echo is hands free it's like have a personal assistant. We loved "Alexa" so much we purchased a dot for the Master bedroom.
Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
I love it, pretty fast!!! Good resolution, nice stream
Excellent price for a tablet. Hit for my daughter, she loves it!
I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
I can only compare this to the previous Kindle and is far superior in all aspects but one, the battery. The battery is a lot less reliable and I do not mean by use, the other way. I was used to left my previous kindle several days without to later come back and use it with a decent amount of battery left. In this case I have found this more than once empty.
Streaming works great! Very fluent! Very fast processing power!
Great device. Only issue is if your not using it for music then the Dot is a better buy.
Bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. Perfect for all ages. I love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. I also love the ability to set the time settings for them. It also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year.
I just bought a 4K tv so I wanted to make certain that I obtained a media player that delivered 4K content. I looked that the Roku, Apple TV, but I settled on the Amazon Fire TV because of my previous Amazon account and the price point. The device is quite elegant with a small form factor. The remote is equally small and minimal in form but quite effective. The mic works great to interact with Alexa. Just for fun, I found it interesting that Alexa will answer a question comparing it to Siri, but Siri does not reciprocate.I like that Amazon has deals to allow HBO GO streaming on it, whereas my Sony TV was not allowed to thanks to some deal between Comcast Xfinity and the networks. Other apps such as Youtube and Sling also work just fine on the app. It also syncs up to your Amazon account and on some songs, lyrics will appear on the screen like some sort of karaoke service. I thought that was a nice feature.I wish there were a few more options on it to customize loadout or app management. Also, at times the device would disconnect from my N network and connect to the G band for some reason, forcing me to manually reset it. I wish it would automatically connect to the higher band, but it's a minor complaint. The bottom of the remote can scratch easily as well, so don't slide it across the coffee table as I am apt to do.Overall, this is a great product and I have no regrets purchasing it.
I bought one a month ago for my 6 year old Granddaughter as she is always on mine. So I gave this one to her 9 year old brother for his birthday this month! Love the Kindles
You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
Great for taking on trips. 16 GB, camera, computer
I really love this tablet for my toddler! The only things I have against it are that there is no kickstand on it, it may lag at times, and there is no way to lock the screen so the movie can't be exited. Other than that it's a great tablet.
This item was purchased as a Christmas gift and the receiver loves it. They mostly play games and read books on it.
Kindle fire is excellent device I personally have one as do all of my children at this point
I absolutely love, love, love my echo!! Simple to set up, great sound quality.
This is the third kindle fire that I have purchased so it is obvious that we absolutely love them. Now all three grandsons have one and they are on them constantly. Excellent gift for any age.
The features are endless. Perfect device for those who like to go hands free with doing simple tasks!
I accidentally cracked my screen on the first day when the Voyage was too close to my rocking chair and neither Best Buy nor Amazon would do anything to help. Well, Amazon offered $15 off purchasing the Paperwhite and that wasn't something I wanted at all. Now I'm stuck with a $199 broken Voyage. Not a happy customer. I realize it was my fault but thought they should do something more to minimize the loss and keep my business.
Once up and running, Alexa can perform a variety of your typical assistant features. Itll set timers, tell you the time, set alarms, tell you what your day looks like from your connected calendar, tell you about your commute or the weather and answer questions about all sorts of things
Got my FireTv box with kodi and is working awesome
My nephews are always playing with my smartphone so I bought this for them and they are happy to have their own device to play with.
excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance
I bought this for my 6 year old Neice for Christmas. She loves it. No issues this far. Charges fast and has child lock features.
The Fire is a good handy tablet. So far I have not been able to download a document from something other than Amazon. The document I am trying to download is the reason I bought Fire in the first place.
My husband loves it!! He likes telling Alexa to play music and to tell jokes
I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
I got one for each of my grandsons! Great for long car rides-download movies from Amazon Prime
I would recommend a kindle fire to everyone. My kids love them and love amazon!
This a great product to be used by the whole family.
Bought this for my young granddaughter. It is so easy for her to use. We can control the content. She is learning her colors and alphabet with the help of this tablet. Lots of free content. It was easy to connect to the home wifi. Great battery life.
Works exactly as expected. I bought this in an effort to convert my old flatscreen with no smart capabilities into a smart tv. Definitely got the job done!
Replaced a Nook with the fire tablet. Disappointed that I cannot use Chromecast from it. Did not realize I would be tied to amazon. But it is a good tablet so far
Would completely recommend this product offers everything we were looking for in a movie box system
This tablet is a great starter for a low cost!!!!!
I bought this strictly for the streaming 4K content from Netflix. Not sure if this happened to others, but season 2 of HOC would never stream correctly in 4K. The other seasons worked just fine. Also, HOC looks very very good just on HD 5.1.
Easy to use.
Bought this for my mom. Easy to use for her. I was impressed by the responsiveness of this tablet. Couldn't ask for more at the price I paid for it. Great purchase.
Works great. Hooked it up to our smart lights. Very convenient and useful
This was a present for my mother in law who is 70 for Mother's Day and she loves it and I was worried she might not. Now I'm going to probably get one for myself!!
Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.
It is very user friendly and worked well for my travel needs!
Good for music, but thought it would do a lot more.
Easy to use, great screen resolution, and very simple to download material to read.
Bought this tablet for my five-year-old son he plays it every single day loves it great kid friendly tablet
I like it. It keeps my granddaughter business and great apps too.
Amazon's "Alexa" program is surprisingly intuitive (and the microphone can hear me from across the house). This product worked a lot better than I initially expected it to.
good one..I liked it..even my kids enjoy this.use it for all games
Great reader. Bought it for my wife and she loves it
This is a good inexpensive tablet. It is only a little heavy and doesn't have a good camera. Other than that, the rest ia very good
Does a great job of playing music, getting news,reporting sports scores and answering trivia questions.
The child that this item was purchased for hasn't put it down. He is really enjoying it!
This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.
Wanted something to take with me. (I don't use a smart phone), Quick looks at the web, When I'm away from the desktop, Also some games.
I love my amazon fire HD tv box. This thing is the wave of the future. The 4k content looks amazing.
This does anything you can imagine, you really don't need cable
Purchased this orange Kindle as a gift for my niece after having one for my kids for a year. It runs great and at that price there are no complains.
The Echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy. Alexa (echo) learns as you talk to it and ask questions. You have to go online and enable different skill sets to allow Alexa to answer more questions. As for operating smart devices this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense. You have to purchase wifi/smart bulbs and switches before she can operate. One smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as $30. That's pretty steep to me. On occasion, Alexa will begin talking when no one has called her to respond.
The point of a kindle is to read it like a paper print and this product achieves that. I considered the higher level products but settled on this as the best value option. The product met expectation.
I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect.
Exciting for the family entertainment, enjoying all music
The Amazon Echo is one of the best purchases I have ever made
I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection.
I thinj its a but overpriced. If i knew better would have opted for the flash
I love Alexa and that lady knows everything. I have even hooked up some more functions to her.
Went from nook to Kindle . Love it. Awesome item. Love it
Got this on black Friday sale & for the price, you couldn't beat it. I ended up purchasing 3 of these. The graphics & camera are definitely limited, but if all you need is a basic tablet to run Amazon apps, this is great for the price. The fact that it is expandable with an SD card puts it above the more expensive basic Kindle that my kids use that constantly is full.
This does 4k, Netflix, Hulu Amazon prime video, and Playstation Vue. Does it all and works flawlessly. Have used Amazon fire stick before and there is lag. No here with this product .
This was a Christmas gift. Lots of games and books for children. Easy-to-use. 5 year old is in love with it. Nice size.
We love having the Amazon Echo as it is lots of fun. You can set timers, reminders, find out the weather and lots of fun stuff. I believe if hooked up to the correct apps, you can even ask it to play specific songs. We really love it!
For what I need, this unit works great. I use it mostly to catch up on reading and looking at photos that I load via MicroSD card. Great resolution.
Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures.
this was just ok... wish the camera quality was better.
Looks like a real book! It's amazing! It doesn't last weeks like it says maybe a little over a week but I don't mind charging my electronics. It's really nice especially if you have kindle unlimited! I would recommend for people who like to read on the go!
Helpful, learned a lot. Gave good information. Good comparison
Bought it for my nephew for Xmas we shall see how it holds up for him
I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It's been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet
The Echo is very entertaining and informative. It is an excellent speaker too.
Great device. Works great and so far no issues. :)
Excellent TV box that brings you all the latest shows from Amazon and other venues..superfast with 4k
I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games.
I love the versatility of the Echo, It has a great music sound and does so much more.
Good tablet to purchase for a first time tablet user.
We puchased an Echo as a start to our home automation and fell in love with it's sound and capabilties.
We bought 2 of these for Xmas kids love them great
Doesn't really answer my questions but can set timers and tell me the weather
It has been one of the best things I've seen in its great
Only small issue was setting up to start with. My kid took care of that.
this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
I was looking for an inexpensive tablet for my 8 year old, that he could use for educational games and just for the usual game play and this tablet has been perfect. Battery life is good, speed is outstanding and you can't beat the price!
Great product for kids and adults.Super simple set up that only took a couple minutes!
I bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop. I thought this looked more user friendly since she knows my 5 year old nephew can use an iPad.
Easy set up / good sound quality / loads of fun to play with
I was a little bit hesitant to get the Voyage over the Paperwhite and after holding the two I knew I wanted the Voyage. This device has been perfect! (Advice: Ask Amazon to remove the ads if you're a Prime member!)
The kids were loving these as Christmas gifts but here we are 6 months later and the battery charging port barely even works. We have to hold the charging cable at a certain angle for it to even charge. I wasn't expecting a super long life out of these tablets at $39.99 a pop but should've lasted longer than 5-6 months. Very upset with 4 sad kiddos.
Awesome product! If you enjoy reading this is a must have.
Super fun to connect with smart light bulbs and smart plugs - makes you feel like you have a Jetson house. The customized flash briefings are a good way to start the day, too.
Not a bad display for the price. AMAZON ads pop up
Best part about this unit is it works with KODI. Easy to setup and use. The remote is small and easy to understand. For the price I would highly recommend this above all the others.
Bought this for our 9 year old daughter and she loves it! Easy to use and kid friendly.
This was bought for my daughter and it works great with her but I wouldn't recommend it for anything intense.
i can't ask for this tablet to more than what its supposed, good starter for kids before they get an iPad :)
Great to use as a portable speaker to take around with you as you work outside as long as you have a wifi connection. I use it with Pandora and Amazon unlimited music.
I LOVE the Amazon Echo, it's everything I expected and more
My Fire is easy to use, lightweight, and small enough to carry in my purse.
Great selections. Hard to find assistance at times.
Works beautifully. First I connected ethernet to Internet. Discovered wireless capabilities just as good. Great programing.
This tablet is good. It has good specs but sometimes it is hard to get the USB charging cable out of the port and it should run on full android.
Bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. The free "May Day" feature is the best part- I don't get called for tech support all of the time.
Great for the kids, and has a good battery for how much they use it
Easy to use. Great price for a starter Tablet! I bought 3, 1 for me & 2 as Christmas Gifts for Family. It feels good with the Spirit of Giving when You know they use them everyday. :)
Really makes it easy to listen to any music I want without having to pick up my phon
Pros: This tablet is great for its price, has good battery life and it is resistant enough for daily use. Cons: The operating sistem is limited to only downloading apps from the Amazon App Store and the screen resolution is no that great.
Easy to use and books transferred without issue nice screen
Love my Alexa! Love asking Alexa about the weather, traffic, etc.
don't care much for it you have to purchase any apps that r used on daily basis
I have never been a fan of "smart" tvs, the interfaces of the best are terrible...The firetv interface is clean, fast and does what i want with relatively little fuss. These are a little more money than the firetv sticks, but much faster and have USB ports for wireless keyboards
This is one of the best products we have every purchased. Plays any songs, give directions, weather and the sound quality is EXCELLENT!
Purchased as git for family member. I have owned and used mine for over a year. Fun and informative.
Was a late christmas gift to myself. Updated from the paperwhite 2 and the difference is very noticeable.
Bought the Amazon Fire 7 inch tablet on a BF whim while standing in the checkout line. Glad I did. Nice and compact. Fast. I'm using it daily and finding I can do more with it than I thought I could.
While the design is a little industrial for my taste, it does blend into a room pretty well. The home automation integration is nice too, especially the integration with the Logitech Harmony remote. I love being able to turn things on and off with my voice. Another great feature is the music playback. Alexa has a song for every occasion! Finally, it's kinda fun to talk to. My niece came over and talked to it for hours one day... Go figure! Give it a try!
Alexa is a great device to have around the house. You can conveniently add things to your shopping or to-do list or get a quick snapshot of the news and weather. Alexa has fun features like playing jeopardy and 20 questions. The only downside is she is not connected to the internet, so you can't get answer to random questions, like if you were asking Siri. Hopefully that feature will come soon!
I tryed the 16GB to see if it was any different from the 8GB and found little difference.May hold more apps
I am pleased that it has all the apps she needs on it
Great for reading books. Does everything an iPad or tablet does.
I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.
I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
This item is excellent for easy search of movies and shows. Highly recommended!
Alexa is a terrific product that does exactly what it says it will do and the fact that it is always learning and growing makes it even more beneficial to your home I've used it for almost 3 weeks now and it is just like everybody says it is
My daugther is loving this so farOne issue charging port is weak and having a hard time charging
For the price that I paid for this tablet, ut is a great deal. It does exactly what i bought ir for
I had a kindle for several years that I thought was adequate until I purchased the paper white. What a difference with all of the added features this Kindle offers. I like the light with it's brightness feature most of all. The ease of use makes it a great e reader for everyone. I highly recommend the new PaperWhite.
This is a decent tablet for the money. Pleased with purchase.
Best Buy was supposed to give me $20 for the purchase of the kindle and I was told that I would get an email. I never did. The Kindle does what it says however I prefer the buttons to turn the pages that were on the 1st & 2nd models. Also I prefer to have the name of the book listed rather than a picture of the cover of the book. The picture is too small and unclear which makes it difficult to see which book it is and you only get three on the first page. I prefer to see as much as possible at first glance. Also, I love the lighting that is adjustable and allows you to read in bed and does not disturb my night's rest. Overall, I really enjoy using it.
It is agood tablet for beginner kids and great for the price
Bought for my wife as a birthday gift. She absolutely loves it!!!
A wonderful product for those who are not on the apple hype train. Easy to use and the price was on point. Expandable memory really makes this a million times better than the baser iPads
Really inexpensive and does everything I need it to for my boys!
I bought this tablet for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! He reads pdf's from work on this tablet and can easily study with it. He says it doesn't hurt his eyes and I couldn't have purchased a better gift for him. If you're thinking about it, go for it and get it! I got a pretty good deal on it, $100!!
I bought a FireStick because of the price. After purchasing the FireTv don't think I'll go back. Also if you buy this product sign up for your free Amazon Prime and checkout the movies and tv shows you get in HD and 4k..
I bought this for my daughter. She is 14 and loves it. It was simple to set up and to use. Speaking into the remote makes finding what you want even easier.
Fast response time from unit. Works great. Easy to use. Enjoy watching the device.
I like the product I purchased actually purchased a second one I just have other concerns with Best Buy
We bought Amazon Echos for both mothers for Mother's Day. They are learning to use them but love them so far!
This was a gift for Christmas. We bought this on a black Friday sale. Price was reasonable
This is a great tablet plus you can't beat this price.
I buy this tablet for my nephew and he is happy with it.
Love the product! Want to purchase another for my mother.
I purchased for a 7 year old perfect buy. She loved it
I bought this to compliment the Sharp 4K 50" I had brought from Best Buy about two months ago.We the 4K content does not show up, you have to search for it on Netflix and Amazon Video. Once you find it however it is beautiful.
It's the Amazon Echo. Does what it says and gets you in touch with Alexa hands-free.Works good and awesome for the smart home person.
Exactly what I thought the amazon fire stick would be.
This replaced an original iPad , Great Price and performance
Delighted plus really well made product
convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too.
This thing is ok. Next time we get electronics it will be Amason
The Amazon Fire TV box hooks to cable modem easily and is very user-friendly. Great for Amazon Prime members. The only issue is that there is not enough 4K content out there and, in my opinion, does not warrant the price as opposed to the more portable Amazon Fire TV stick. Yes, the box has a faster processor and more RAM than the stick, but for content, I've had NO PROBLEM with the stick and it's cheaper.
good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
My daughter bought this with her birthday money. She loves it and is always playing it.
I love my Amazon box!! It's easy to use and with the right internet connection, there's no buffing or waiting for movies to download. I compared it to the Apple TV & for the overall money, this was the better purchase.
I purchased 2 to give to my daughters for Christmas. They really enjoy them. They were easy to set up and they are easy to read on.
I Love To Read On This New Voyage. I Take it Everywhere With Me.Bought A Cute Book Cover For It Also. I Would Recommend This To Anyone Who Loves To Read & Doesn't Want To Lug Around Heavy Books. x x
Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.
This was a gift to my grandma and it is simple enough for her to use it and understand it!
I bought it for my daughter's birthday and she loves it!
This Fire TV is a better choice than the Fire Stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a LAN connection or if you have potential wireless connections. It also has the advantage of expandable storage, although I've not found a need for it yet. As with the newest Apple TV, the Fire TV uses a graphic intensive interface. Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the way Amazon chooses to organize the selections. All in all, the Fire TV is the best way to take advantage of your Amazon Prime Membership.
Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!
Set up really easy. We cancelled cable right away. Still figuring out which apps are for us. Got antenna for local channels.
We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.
Purchased this as a gift for someone for Christmas. It's no iPad but you can't beat the price.
Great display and colors easy to use. Very good entry level tab great price seems to be very durable great apps. Would recommend to anyone wanting entry level tablet.
you couldnt really expect anything more from a device so cheap compared to other tablets
Easy to use. Durable great material very happy with it.
It's small and compact. There is no glare, battery life is awesome and it's very easy to read in the dark.
Love the reading on my kindle. The camera is great.
Very easy to use! Comfortable and easy to see screen. Lots of books to choose from.
This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase.
Great product for the price!! I would recommend this to anyone!!
My daughter uses this and loves it. The only complaint she had was she cannot get games from the google store because it will only allow game and app downloads from the Amazon store and Amazon does not have all the games. But as far as working, it does what it is supposed to.
For the price this tablet can't be beat. My wife mostly uses it 4 reading and Amazon shopping. It does everything she needs it to do. Battery life is very good as well.
Very good item. Works well for child. easy to use.
Very happy with this purchase. For the price you can not go wrong. I mainly use for reading so I am sure for a techy geek this would not work.
Overall am very happy with the purchase. Both Quality and price made this hard to resist.
This tablet has been just what we were looking for to introduce our children to tablets. The price is excellent!
This is perfect for kids. The parental controls make me feel secure in letting my child use the tablet safely.
Purchased several of these tablets for my nieces and nephews during Black Friday. Got them for a great price! They are great for the kids, only caveat is the storage space, 8GB, which is not much when you start downloading game apps but you can buy a MICROSD card to expand the storage. So far it's been useful for watching videos, browsing internet, and playing games. I have Amazon Prime so there are other benefits that you can access on this tablet with Prime. The only negatives I can think of are the storage space, the camera is not the best quality (but not why I bought it) and you can only use it with WiFi. So far loving it and glad I bought it.
This is a great product I love the amazon Alexa. Must have if you want a smart house
Works great, easy to setup, simple to navagate, layout and options are easily to use
Inexpensive tablet. Funtional and great for reading. It has the blue screen that make it great for reading.
The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great.
Great item if you would want to control your electronic devices without lifting an arm. Great volume! Great item overall.
got this for mom since she has bad wifi , wired is the way
This is a great device, with good sound quality. Alexa's voice recognition is very accurate. The biggest problem in my house is fighting over who will talk to her!
Somewhat substandard. iPads are certainly better. But it gets the job done for $50.
This is a great item to own in your home. So you can entertain friends, family, and yourself!!!
Amazing for the price. Exactly what I needed and perfect for trips.
The main reason I purchased this was because I like to annotate scriptures and insert personal notes or related notes to passages especially meaningful to me. It's much easier to insert comments now with the keyboard display than it was to insert comments on the old Kindle I have, so that was a huge bonus. The one draw back/gripe I have is the "back" triangle button. The scriptures I read have hyperlinks that take me to other scriptures, and before on the old Kindle, I could hit the back button and it would take me back to the previous page I was on. E.g., if I was on page 10, and selected a link to page 14, the back button would take me back to page 10. With this kindle, the back button takes you back to the library, and the previous page tap/swipe takes you back to the previous page, e.g., if I'm on page 10, and I take a link to page 14, it'll take me to page 13. The work-around that I discovered is using the bookmark function which is only slightly more time-intensive than the old Kindle back button. The only other concern I have is the battery life. If I'm going to enjoy some long reading without heavy annotation (e.g., reading fantasy), I'll probably use my old Kindle. If I want to do some serious annotation and cross referencing on different commentaries (e.g., scripture study), the new Kindle is the better bet. The commentaries I reference are PDFs - I could create a Kindle book out of them, but it messes up the tables in the PDFs, and I don't care for the PDF viewer that came with the Kindle because you cannot bookmark the PDF or annotate it. I purchased a very inexpensive PDF app called "exPDF Reader" which does everything I want with PDFs. All-in-all, the Kindle - Fire is a great tool and fits into my lunch box, so I take it everywhere. I read that others were concerned about it's weight, but I find it to be light. I'm used to reading door stopper books, and it is definitely more manageable than one of those. A pleasant surprise I had was the "blue shade" feature which enables me to read at night without worry of negatively impacting my sleep cycle/quality of sleep. You don't need a separate booklight for this like you do for the old Kindle, so that's a nice perk too.
good starter tablet or great for games. fits in the purse or coat jacket.it was on sale for 50 dollars
As d scribed
Is a great first tablet for a beginner or children
Great tablet and for a great price. Good for gifts.
excellent
If you have a smart tv you might not want this unless you are going to install kodi
I finally cut the cord since my AT&T Uverse was getting really expensive. It works great with Sling TV and you can easily search through all your apps using the voice search. I should have cut the cord sooner.
For the cost of this tablet it is amazing. You can upgrade the storage via a microSD card so you won't run out of room. The Amazon version of android is easy to navigate and if you have a prime membership can't be beat.
It a great personal assistant. Love how easy it is to use and connect with other devices.
Does everything I thought it would do and then some. Bought one for my daughter and a friend too.
If you travel, this is a great accessory to have and use. I like the light, compact size and screen resolution. Works great outdoors as well as indoors. Will hold many books.
This is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products. It is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs. Great sound and portability.
Does exactly what I was hoping for. Amazing toy and everyone should get one
Best e-reader in the world ! Now even looks better !
Have the smaller Fire HD tablet and was looking at the larger tablets but read the reviews and when this tablet came on sale at an extremely great price, purchased this one. Am very happy with it although the photo quality is not as good as my Samsung Galaxy, it is fine in most lighting situations. It's features are good and would purchase it again.
One of the simplest tablets probably out there, only good for those that want to get into Amazon.com shopping. Good value for bargain proce.
The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite is has many features and small so you carry it around and light in weight.
Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up.
This little tablet is great for so many things. Can't believe the quality I got for the price I paid.
works perfect
We got this for my son to use as a reader and also do audio books with read along. It has been great. He had a laptop but that is too large to be practical. This works perfectly for him.
I love my kindle. I prefer this to the fire because I only want it for books not applications and I can read this screen in the sunlight. The battery life is good and even better if I turn the WiFi off. I'm very happy with my purchase.
I didn't want to mess with or pay for an additional satellite box, so this was a great way to be able to watch things in a bedroom we converted into a tv room.
I had trouble deciding between the regular kindle and the Paperwhite because I read at night. It was a great decision, because when I turn the light all the way down, I can't read at night. It's lightweight and sturdy. My only complaint is the speed of switching between books and the strange flicker with the page turn. It's not a show stopper, because it is so much better than trying to read on my iPad mini.
I am really enjoying being able to read books online that are downloaded from the public library. I have read 5 books in the last few weeks now that I can use the public library system to access book titles. No more buying books at the bookstore
Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips
This is a great device, and free's up my phone. Great for internet, games, radio, etc.
This table is okay for me. But it is great for kids
Recipient very happy, good product, makes it easier for recipient to do email and play his games. Too hard on eyes to do on cell phone and more convenient than PC,
Very easy to hold and read in the evening without hurting your eyes. Love it.
User friendly and gives me access to all my streaming services.
I love the amazon tablets because you can get some many free kids games. My kids use this tablet all the time. Very reliable.
I am amazed with this tablet. For the price I expected something cheaply made to last a short while. I was wrong!! Very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand/arm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. If you have any downloads you will need a separate SD card for memory. The down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. The standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. I put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast (no streaming issues). We recently took it on a week long vacation and it was great to have downloaded games, books, movies, etc for the teens to watch/play. Overall, a great product for a really great price!!
Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,
I can't seem to be able to hook it up with my internet connection. I will be returning it to the store.
I purchased this tablet for my grandkids and it was so easy to setup and also operate. They liked it so much that I will probably purchase two more so each grandkid will have their own.
Family and I are loving it and we have yet, had a real opportunity to get into it!
If you are looking for big banks for your bucks with an Android tablet, you can rarely go wrong with the Amazon Fire tablet. And if you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, you definitely should have this tablet.
Use it for reading my online textbook for class. Easy to read on and like how light and compact it is. Battery life so far has been great but I have only had it close to a month.
Great and super for reading and graphics are clear a concise
I bought two of these for two of my children. The parental controls are great and I can easily control their access to content. The ability to make them do something educational like read for 30 min before playing games is awesome. This tablet does everything I wanted it to do.
The Amazon Echo works well. So well, in fact, that I haven't felt the need to use the remote very often. However, there are a few occasions when it is great: 1) When listening to music, getting the volume just right using voice commands can get annoying. The remote is quick, easy, and allows greater fine-tuning. 2) When there is a lot of background noise. The Echo is good, but sometimes has difficulty hearing correctly when I have my kitchen fan on or there is a lot of other background noise. Speaking into the remote never fails (and also doesn't require you to say the wake word). 3) When in another room. I often listen to music on my Echo, even when in another room. Yelling across the house is disturbing, and doesn't always work, but the remote allows me to skip, pause, or turn off the music from my office or bedroom. It's also great for adding items to the shopping and to-do lists.If I lost my remote or, more likely, dropped it in the kitchen sink, I'd buy another without hesitation.
Works very well. It is perfect for my brother whom it was bought for
Not the best tablet. Decent image, but lackluster performance.
My son loves this thing hasn't put it down yet keeps him entertained
Cheap tablet but solid built. Weak audio and poor camera.
Alexa makes it easy to add a soundtrack to your life. Just tell her what to play as you prepare dinner and then change it for your romantic meal; no need to stop what you are doing. She will even give you equivalents as you adapt a recipe, tell you a joke, or read an audiobook.
Bought just for fun during a special sale and we love it! Bought the Echo Dot too. Easy to set up and use. Love it for bedtime to get music or sounds to fall asleep. Timer is great and alarm feature is very helpful as a back up to my phone.
Works great with my new kindle!
Clarity is excellent. Easy breezy to use. Charges quickly and lasts a long time
Bought this to activate playstation vue and have had good luck with it so far.
This is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass)
Easy to set up, and easy to use. Can read in bright sunlight with no glare at all. Performs as advertised. Battery life is exceptional. Will last for 8 to 10 hours on a charge depending on brightness setting.Would recommend this to any avid reader. It is light and will hold hundreds of books.
Works great even in OK network areas. Long battery life and easy to use. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
My son loves his tablet he received for his birthday!
Best Fire tablet at a reasonable price. Much faster than the 7 inch.
Use it daily home and on the road, my husband is hooked on it as well
I like this because I can plug in anywhere. It is unnecessarily expensive.
Picture is great & for the price it's more than I expected my son loves it.
It was easy to hook up, and it is easy to use, the directions are complete. Would recommend to anyone wanting to supplement their cable or dish services.
enjoy listening to music and getting weather update
I bought this Amazon Fire to replace the one I had. My old one need to have the power button replaced and the cost to do that was more than what I paid for the new one. I like that I can take pictures (which I couldn't do with my old one) and it feels lighter. I can read my books, check my email and surf the web. The only negative thing is that I still haven't figure out how to print from it. It was a lot easier from the old one. I'm still exploring all the apps that are preloaded.
Amazon always has great products, I would purchase again
Excellent tablet at an exceptional price. I highly recommend this tablet.
Works great!! My brother loved it. It's easy to use!
When I bought this product I never expected it to be anything like this. It has got decent screen quality and response time. Definitely worth the price. Requires amazon account to install apps, read books etc.
My 3 yr old has already figured it all out. User friendly and durable with the case. Lots of free content, keeps them busy when need be.
I purchased the Echo as a Deal of the Day for $130. At this price it is worth it. I have learned only simple things so far (Prime Music, weather, daily Jeopardy questions and getting it to tell jokes). But, I think it is well made and I'm sure I'll learn how to use it for more things.
This was a purchase made for a cruise. I could not see my fire in the sun.
This device has so many great features. I love how it stays charged for so long and the font can be enlarged for easier reading.
Happy with purchase would recommend! Always happy !
Got this tablet for my niece and nephew, it is wonderful for children.
It is great to be able to watch movies commercial free and whenever we want.
The tablet is okay, I mean it does the job. However, the wifi is really spotty. We even changed the wifi password (based on a YouTube video) to ensure that it works..but it keeps going in and out
I purchased this as a gift for my mother. I already owned a Kindle Paperwhite and knew that it would be perfect for her. It is lightweight and easy to hold; lit from behind so no glare (easy on the eyes); and the font size can be easily adjusted. A charge lasts for a week or more. With a Kindle you can carry an entire library of books with you. The Paperwhite easily slips into a purse or large coat pocket, so you are never without a book whether you are traveling or waiting for someone. I was right about my mom; she was thrilled to receive her Kindle, and at 86 she is excited about using new technnology.
I enjoy my fire tablet and I like it is HD picture
We purchased the Amazon Echo on a whim, but really enjoy using it. Easy to get information with just a question, listen to music, get local weather information. Even my 4 year old granddaughter knows how to ask Alexa questions. Great addition to our household.
Outstanding I love this device highly recommend it for anybody and everyone user-friendly
I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. I don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the Paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi.
Great product that has lots to offer and is constantly learning. Love saying good morning and hearing the joke of the day.
I know I can pay to get rid of the ads but it's just a bad idea, tablet works fine otherwise. And if your okay with Amazon apps.
I bought three tablets for my children of various ages. They play with it everyday. It was difficult to find apps that are similar to Google Play. I did find some apps that they enjoy.pros: easy to usecons: it take time to find apps that you really want if you are use to the google play store.
Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.
It's for my kids so I didn't want to spend to much but they down load all the games they want and keeps them busy
It is easy to set up and easy to use. You can use it to watch videos from the Amazon Prime video or listen to music with the Amazon Prime music or read on the Kindle. Great value for everything you get.
I really like Alexa, this has been one of the funnest purchases I've made :-)
Tablet is exactly what I was looking for. Works great.
My husband wanted this for Fathers Day, so I got it for him. He loves it, and I do too. We get the temperature and forecast each morning, set timers for our grandkids playing on electronics, set alarms, play music, and the grandkids get Alexa to tell them jokes. It is amazing, and we talk to her all day. The technology is so outstanding.
This is my 4th Kindle - I use it as a tablet when I travel
My child loves it workes flawlessly and does everything she like to do
I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.
my son loves his tablet! best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some games and apps.
Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
Hate using cable very easy to use. Family is enjoying using it.
at first view I was thinking too much to get or not get this product, but I tried and I love it... Amazon Video is the most amazing video library paying yearly and enjoy at home :) Love this product.
Purchased as gifts for kids and they really enjoy them.
Got it for my husband to read at night in bed, he loves that it has a lit screen unlike the original model. However he can't read his textbooks from school so that is a big negative.
Was tired of using my iPad as my sole reader. Decided to go back to Kindle. This is by far the best Amazon has done in the Kindle arena yet. Simplistic, sleek & no more eye strain.
I bought this item ad a gift and would buy it again hands down.
I loved the movies and the tabletPerfect for my purposes. Jbl wireless were greatFor music but wereLacking for phone use.
Overall good product and got everything I need to stay tune.
This is the most incredible device. I absolutely in love. The kids can play games on it and I can check the weather. She can do anything!
I got this on black Friday for $35. For the price I wasn't expecting much. Let me tell you it exceeded my expectations. I was only wanting this to play music, but I have been checking my email, browsing the web, using Bluetooth for music. Its amazing. It can go the whole day on one charge. You will defiantly want a SD card for it! It rarely lags and is pretty fast too. Only thing I don't like is the ads on lock screen (you can pay 15 more to remove them)
Great little tablet! The expandable memory makes this quite a bargain!
It's somewhat of a step up from the Roku 3 I was previously using, but not as much as I was expecting. I think it's a couple firmware updates away from being better than it is now.Spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why I could only connect to my dual-band router at 2.4GHz and not 5GHz. 1.5 hours on the phone with Verizon FiOS tech support was unsuccessful as other devices connected at 5GHz without issue. Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider. Voice search works well if you want only to be presented with Amazon's viewing options, for some reason I thought search was universal, but only movies and TV shows available through Amazon show up. Bummer :-(The FireTV-2 is OK, less than I was expecting and with other good options around the corner, I'm beginning to doubt my choice...
I really enjoy today's electronic gadgets and this is a really nice addition to my collection.
For the price, I feel like if you complain about anything, you're just going to sound crazy. I got this on Black Friday special, which was awesome. I use this for home automation and playing clash of clans. If you're big into Amazon stuff, this also has a nice selection of amazon apps.
my daughter loves her tablet she got it for christmas and has lots of fun with her own games
Love it. Love my new fire tablet. It is so convenient
Have the original fire hd, but wanted another one. this one is great because of the camera.
Although we haven't utilized any of the smart features (we will eventually), do enjoy asking questions and listening to music. Entertaining for the family
Works great for everything we want our daughter to do
My grandkids love to use it. It has so much for them to choose and they learn too.
For $35, its worth. The user interface is bit difficult to use and touch screen response is not as expected.
My wife loves it. Great picture quality and easy to use
Use this for my scripture study, It does what I need it to do plus.
Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.
I am greatly satisfied with this tablet. And the price is great too.
Easy to set up and use. Love it for streaming you tube and other apps. Voice command is awesome!
Great product I am thoroughly satisfied. Will purchase again if needed.
Amazon echo is a nice buy but needs to be fine tuned a bit.
Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well
I bought this for my 13 year old niece who has autism and she loves it. Great price and great tablet for kids.
We only use Alexa for music and are glad we purchased the larger speaker.
My grandson loves it and there are lots of educational games .
This is a great Kindle for the price. I can take pics of my flowers and send them to my kids. I can download books and read anywhere. I can play games. I can look things up on the web. It's small enough to take any place I go.
I love my new Kindle. It is bigger than the last Kindle I had. This Kindle is much easier to handle and to read.
This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child
I absolutely love the Echo. I use it as part of my smart home set up and Alexa keeps me up to date with my appointments, weather and even traffic when I am about to leave for work. Glad I made this purchase.
Best streaming box on the market hands down. Bar none
I bought this as a gift for my son and his wife. I rhougjt with having a young baby at home and their hands always full it would come in handy. They liked the idea but after doing their own review search, decided it wasn't for them.
We bought the kindle fire to replace a broken iPad 2, which was now out of date for any further updates. I love the parental controls. The case has been a savior for a few drops. My daughter loves the size of the tablet. The 2 year replacement plan and 1 year unlimited FreeSpace makes this the perfect tablet for my child. She loves that she doesn't have to ask everytime she wants a new game or video. We chose to expand the memory up to 128gb with a microsd and so no worries about running out of storage space! My only complaint is that the battery life isn't anywhere near the power of an iPad. So keep your charger with you!
The Amazon fire tv is amazing. It's really snappy and works really well. I highly recommend it.
Performance of the device is good, meets expectations.
Overall a great sound from a small package. Price may be a little high for the money but other than that a great purchase.
It's comfortable to hold in my hands, the screen is pleasing to look at and doesn't cause eye strain, the backlight allows me to read at night without being blinded, graphics are crisp when I read a comic, and the long-lasting battery doesn't induce charge anxiety. Also, as a nice surprise, there are countless books, free to borrow via Kindle Unlimited, because I'm a Prime Student member.
I've had the Amazon Fire TV for a few weeks now an absolutely love it. My wife and I have cut the cords with cable tv and now stream everything through Fire TV. The quad core processor can keep up with the most demanding HD streams and 3D movies without buffering. If needed Fire TV can be hardwired to you router for additional speed. The apps are endless and you can run all of the popular options out there including Hulu and Sling. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking to escape cable.
Alexa is a great music ai product. I totally love it! I bought it because many of my friends have it and i personally would recommend it to other friends.
Xmas presents for grandkids they play games and they take lots of pictures . Good purchase .
So I have now purchased two Amazon Echos from Best Buy. I have one upstairs and one down stairs. My main reason for the purchase was for home automation. I have previously installed several WEMO switches and bulbs in the house and wanted to take advantage of Alexa's ability to control them. Works really well, however I didn't realize she can't control the WEMO bulbs. Hopefully this is something that will come soon. I ask her about the weather, add items to my shopping list, set reminders, listen to music, and use the alarm function to wake me up. So far it's a great buy. Totally recommend this.
Great item to used. Can get alot of apps and games.
This is a very good reader for the money. Very versatile.
I love this thing. Works great with wifi enabled smart home products.
My wife loves the Echo. She listens to her music everyday.
We love this speaker for listening to music, the weather, news, or just anything. It is super portable and even has a hands-free option so it is really like a mini Echo!
My Grandson loves this tablet. With all of the Apps, and the Games also!
Obviously this is not the best tablet in its class, but its a great value for the price.
I saw this item on Amazon if I had ordered it from them I would had to wait 30 days. Best Buy had it in stock for the same price. Having uses it for several weeks I found its a great small tablet for a great price. I plan to buy several more as stocking stuffer. For an entry level tablet you can't beat it.
Processor is pretty quick. Screen resolution is fantastic. So far they have been a great value.
Great concept but speaker not so good at full volume. And maybe better now with the updates
I would never buy another Amazon product personally. It works well but I'd rather use the rca over this. Personal preference has nothing to do with quality
Love this gadget. Plays music, makes grocery list, tells me the weather reports
Use it to listen to the amazon prime music all the time!
The tablet works only when it wants too. I have to restart it all the time for it to work properly. Only have 2 weeks with it and the youtube app sucks it doesn't work properly
Absolutely the best purchase I have made this year.
I purchased this reader for my wife who is constantly reading. My wife currently has a Kindle Fire HD 7" which she loves, but it is not the best for reading poolside where there is a lot of sunlight. I wanted to get her something that was easier to read in direct sunlight so she could enjoy her relaxing time even more.
Great product we are really enjoying it. Easy to set up instructions.
This was a excellent gift for someone who likes to read alot.
I love the kindle. My kids love playing their Disney movies on it. They also have a ton of games we downloaded for free. I highly recommend!
sound is greatdifficult to connect with hotel wifi'sseems durable
for the price this is a solid win. Nothing beats this tablet for the price you are paying. a steal of a device.
We bought this to download movies and books onto for a long plane ride. It worked great! Very happy with the purchase.
I like the fact that there is parental control plus by putting your child's age the kindle will only send you games that are designed for your child's age
Love this bought it in addition to Apple TV it's an overall great product
I read the reviews before purchasing this so I went into it knowing there will be apps pre-loaded that I will have to remove. That being said, I purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and no-hassle protection guarantee.
Works incredibly!!! I will never go back to cable/satellite again!!!
The sole purpose of purchasing the Kindle Fire 7 tablet was reading. I own a Samsung tablet and when attempting to read I become distracted with social media and games. Right now, my Fire table only has apps utilized for reading and video and I've been able to stay focused. I love the portability of the Fire!
This is the best alternative to cable. Very easy to use!
It works!
Purchased as gift for my wife. She loves it. Display is very crisp and easy to read
I purchased the firestick first and had it for awhile and really enjoyed it until i decided to spend the extra money to get the box for my second one and i could not believe the speed difference in the two, the box is awesome i love it!!!
I purchased a Kindle for my 8 year old son and he loves it!. As long as the wi-fi is working properly, he is able to stream videos perfectly. There is also an option through Amazon that allows the user to download videos to play later. Downloading and playing games is very easy unlike a "child" tablet I purchased for him previously. The only negative I would give the Kindle is it may not always have the games/apps that ITunes and Google have but I have not heard any complaints for him! Well worth the money!
Got this for a family member who had on older Kindle that stopped working. They absolutely love it.
Tablet is a bit smaller than I imagined for an 8" tablet and thin and flimsy (I don't like super thin tablets). The color is a bit washed out and there is no way to make the colors darker or richer. Frustrating that you cannot use Google Play store and the sound is not very loud either. It's "ok", I expected it to be better but for simple uses it's fine. Photos are also grainy and faded. It does record in rather low lighting which helps me personally and the battery charge holds a long time. The Tangerine color is also very nice and it's fairly simple to use. Overall, I would have expected a better product, but again for simple use it's ok. Will upgrade to a better product eventually. I was spoiled by my 2013 color Nook.
I bought the kindle at a very nice price and everything works well. I like it.
We enjoy using Alexa for scores of our favorite teams, weather, music and random questions that she is very quick to answer.
Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price
It worked fine however I returned everything as the Kindle was too small.
The light is adjustable and easy on the eyes. A great way to read without disturbing your partner.
Works great, easy to use and can easily be changed to Android.
The simple set up, ease of use, and features of the Echo make it a cool little device to have around the house.
The ECHO is really easy to set and use. I am surprised at the quality of sound.
Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures..
would recommend it to any one. great device to have at home or office
Much better than my original Kindle. Lighter and easier to read. The old Kindle served me well and I won't retire it but it;s newer version is good.
Now a device that is expandable and everyone in the house can use it. Works smooth. I am going to expand additional devices with this now.
Nice in the night, you can adjust the light, and does not hurt you eyes.
It's a good cheap tablet. The ads on the lock screen are a major downfall.
Much lighter than my old kindle. Love it, love the fact that it has the camera too
Upgraded from the original Kindle not sure why we waited so long.
It's been a year and the tablet is still working great.
My boyfriend absolutely loves his Christmas present !
I bought this tablet for my 9 year old. Easy to use and awesome graphics. Easy for adults to manage apps and parental controls.
The Amazon Fire HD8 is a super fast tablet for the money. When combined with an Amazon Prime account the true value is released. We purchased tablets for nearly every family member and linked them all through one Amazon account. This becomes an unbelievable value.
Nice, simple great deal for the money. Good buy, would recommend.
This was the best purchase I've made in a while. The text quality it excellent and the back-lighting is a real plus.
Excellent product thanks !Thanks for the help choosing what I was looking for and all the variety of apps that are available on this one.
Very nice people and good product. I would buy from again.
Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!
fully understand this is a budget tablet, but the memory size and quality of screen are not to par
Great for playing music, asking questions, and playing around. You will discover new uses for it every week.
Excellent Product excellent price ,nice and easy to use thanks
Was not a fan of this product Browsers are extremely slow
Very cool product. Easy setup and very easy to use. Setup was fast, especially if you already have a Amazon account.
very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality
The kindle fire is a good little tablet. Good battery life, easy to use, just wish amazon would add the play store to their tablets but other than that it is a good tablet.
This is awesome. This item was a gift for my elderly father in law who isn't too tech savvy. Didn't want to spend the big bucks with an iPad so this was a great alternative!
I bought this tablet for my 6 year old for his birthday because he chose it when we went shopping for a tablet. He loves it and it is easy to use
Bought this gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. Very easy to order amazon products
Easy to use. Good value. Buying experience was typical for Best Buy - helpful and knowledgable staff made buying experience easy and was able to purchase with confidence for application intended.
Great starter eReader, very simply does what it's made to do.
Easy to set up and operate. Convenient to operate over using my smart phone. Very quick response.
We love the great products that Amazon offers!!! We can p!lay games and chat with family and friends at the same time. I never considered purchasing the tablet due to cost. However, shopping for holiday season for my family they absolutely love the products.
Used with Playstation Vue, this box rocks. It's fast. Plus, when fast forwarding to skip commercials, you actually get to see what corresponds to the timeline, unlike the Roku Streaming Stick, which only shows the current image plus how many minutes ahead or back you can go (not the image, just the increment). With the Fire TV, you actually see the exact minute and second on the timeline along with the image at that time. Plus, Fire TV lets you fast forward up to 64x actual speed.
This little box should be call a happy box. Once you have sat it up all you have to do is say what you want and it pop up on your tv.
I bought this charger Nov 28 2015. It's now Jan 1 2016 (a little over a month later) and the device doesn't charge my kindle any longer. I have the kindle shutdown and allow it to be plugged in for multiple hours. After I take the charger off and start to use my Kindle within 30 minutes I see the Low Battery message. If I use the charger that came with my Kindle for the same amount of time I don't see the Low Battery message as quickly as I did with this charger. Not sure what's going on but makes me think I have a faulty device -- costs a lot of money for something that doesn't work any longer than 1 month
Loved the box does exactly what is supposed to do stream movies all day long
Good sound, easy set up. This little speaker is so fun to use. It is great for me as I have Prime Music, although other music apps work just as well.
I love the Kindle Paperwhite!! It allows you to read in any type of situation. You can control how bright or dim the backlight is. You can also turn the backlight off to save battery when you're in a well lit area. It's got plenty of space for hundreds of books.
This kindle fire is great. The kids love it. They can watch shows and play games. Keeps them entertained.
Alexa is a great enhancement to any home automation system. You need to do some research in order to find out all you can do with it, but this is part of the fun. I can only recommend this to any tech geek ...
When companies play nice with each other... the customers win. This product is fairly novel if you aren't completely bought in to the Amazon ecosystem. I would use it way more if they played nice with Apple services. I know it's a competitor, but if both companies goals are to build an awesome product for a customer, they should play nice.
Perfect for reading books better than iPad because of the front lit screen
I was satisfied with tablet and size and clarity!!
The echo provides great sounds paired with Alexa makes it a great buy.
Works like a charm, just what I was looking for.
I own it for some time and i don't have complains.
Its awsome works beautifully it's awesome perfect video quality does what it says I'm packaging Best Buy service was nice
First, let me say, that I only took one star away, because even after getting I touch installed, my little girl can turn the unit off or mess with whatever is playing by pushing buttons. Not sure if it would have been worth it to pay the extra fifty for the kids edition. Aside from that one single item, this has been an excellent purchase.
More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful
Bought this tablet for my son. Great price and has great features. Camera quality is not good
I purchased this for my husband a few weeks ago. My husband loves Amazon Echo, I should say Alexa! This is very fun to use and ask questions and get answers, and so much more, only limit is your imagination...I think my husband likes Alexa better than me. Just joking, maybe not...lol.
I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.
I have been trying to cut the cord on cable/dish for a while now. This definitely makes it much easier and I'm saving a few bucks. However it does have some glitches. Every once and while it will freeze but it is very uncommon and could be my internet and not the box. I can't dock it too many stars. Would still recommend.
Bought this item for my son and he loves it it works great for movies and games that he likes to play its the perfect size for a toddler ! Can't beat the price or how great it works
My 6 year old loves it easy to use has lots of apps
We bought 2 of these for our kids. First, I couldn't believe the price; they were on sale for $35 but are normally still under $50. I was very leery of getting them 'tablets' because of all the things on the internet. But once I set them up I saw that the Kindle Fire has amazing Parental Controls. I can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them (even how long on specific things - games, videos, web, etc). Most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the Web but it's only kid stuff. I also love the fact that I have access to Amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' Fire's. I can also check what they've been doing on them. They can only download things that I share. All these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. There is something called FreeTime which I believe I have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books. If you have kids, especially younger ones I would highly suggest the Fire. Also, the price is unbeatable, especially the way kids can damage things :)
Great device for the amazon prime holder with 4k support.
I will know which charger is mine
Got this the another day for my niece and she loves everything it has to offer
Bought this as a Mother's Day gift. Fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.
A very convenient and easy way to watch tv programs
This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs.
i have never used this product before found it to be very easy
This is the second Amazon Dot purchased and it keeps getting better
This tablet is exacting what it is, an inexpensive, decent tablet. I got it for grandchildren to use for game apps and books from Amazon.
There are not enough functions on this tablet. But it has great battery life
Was looking for cable tv alternative. This just might be it.
I started with the 7" little brother and liked it a lot, so I decided to upgrade to the larger model. I use it primarily as an e-reader and for some net surfing and Facebook. The WiFi works great and is ready to access and use. Don't buy this unit if you want cell (4g) access to the Internet. It is WiFi only. Frankly, my cell phone takes better pictures, but that's not what I really wanted from the unit. All in all, a great reader with excellent battery life.
Nice, & easy to obtain. My nephew loves it, he has yet to break it
Weight is perfect.Size is right. It fits anywhereView is sharp, day or night
i enjoy reading in many different situations... that is on an airplane ,at the airport the beach, pool ,at home or in the dentist office and almost everywhere else i happen to be. this product is easy to use,easy to read and easy to carry with me.
great item helpful; staff just what was looking for
Love the new Kindle. Priced right. Perfect size. Take it with me everywhere.
I used to prefer paper or hardback books but found I had more access to read online. With the kindle I have been able to access my growing library and the battery life is amazing.
Nice tablet with all the basic features needed for the daily use.
My wife loves it. She has been using the unit since she received it for a gift.
This tablet was a gift for my nephew who is 10, great gift where he can use it to get on the internet. It works well for what he is using it for.
Give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs.
comfortable to hold while reading, not easy to rotate.
How did I ever live without this the sound quality is amazing and extremely easy to set up
feel it should have come with paperwhite kindle and that I should not have had to buy it
It allows me to have many apps and still take a good amount of pictures without running out of storage .
I purchased this for stream since I have prime and the 4K ability as well. Also, for Kodi as I think is the case for most people.
Great item for each room. Easy to use and its very helpful!
My wife and I are so happy with the range of functions on this product that we bought one as a gift for her sister. Love the clear and crisp screen and ability to navigate easily.
Sound quality is way better! I would recommend this product to someone that is going to use it to listen to music. I also have echo dot and those work nice too but Alexa seems more reliable.
Nice tablet for checking emails, playing games. The camera is ok to fair for taking pics
Great over all Tablet! Good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use / loose. Really a plus for travel. Install VLC media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. Add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to Disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults.
Pleasant to read at night while everyone sleeps. Great for use outside and inside. Like reading a book without losing my page
Great product and only $40! I purchased 2 of them along with the compatible SanDisk 200gb micro SD cards to max out the storage capability. I was able to copy my child's stored tv shows & moves on to the sd cards from my PC's hard drive, now they can watch their shows on the go, it makes car trips a lot easier! I also purchased Skullcandy Bluetooth headphones for each of them (got em' for $10 during Christmas). They paired with the Kindle in seconds, no trouble at all. + Kindle's customer support is awesome if you need them, their service is like no other...
Does exactly what it's made for. Nice and clear screen perfect for reading.
Bought this for our 6 year old daughter and she uses it daily. She enjoys watching movies on it and playing learning games. So far it has been very durable and battery life has been great.
This reader does what I expected and has good battery life.
OK for a entry level tablet, great screen for watching movies good HD images.
I brought this product and love it it is much faster than the fire stick and works great wit) my home automation
The echo has great sound and is remarkably intelligent. Great to get it on sale too!
Product serves as reader and simple tablet. Used as personal device when traveling. Good product for the money.
It's great I love it would recommend to anyone worth the money
There is only 1 e-reader that I like better. Kindle unlimited makes this e-reader great for avid readers.
Compact and very good for the price, good picture and sound quality
Every home needs one and very reasonable priced! Easy set up
I didn't expect to receive a premium tablet, but with this device it's great. I got more than I bargained for great job Amazon
The Best Android Based Set-Top Box For it's Price.Amazon outdid themselves here with their Fire TV line. They got it right and they do not appear to be abandoning this anytime soon so hop on now while it's still hot.
Nice product easy to use. Enjoy it very much watching shows with the family.
I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle.
I love the Echo. Would recommend this to everyone. It is very fun and knowledgeable
We have both apple and the fire TV, we like the fire tv the best. It's easy for all ages to access. Glad we bought it.
love it for the kids for educational apps and for required school work and web browsing
I Purchased Three Of These For Family Members As Christmas Gifts On Black Friday For Only $34.99 each!!Pros ; Price Is Great, Responds Well To Touch and Running Applications, Small, Portable, Again The Price Is The Best Pro To This Tablet.Cons : Main Homepage Runs Ads In The Background?? Why?? , Apps Are Only Available Through The Amazon App Store Making A Very Limited Selection Compared To Google Play and The App Store For Apple But Again This Equal To The Tax I Paid On My iPad Air.
I bought two of these tablets, one for my daughter's graduation and one for me. I like the size, the sound and picture/movie quality of it. It was a great price and the option to choose different colors were nice.. I didn't give it 5 stars for the simple fact I can't get all of my important apps that I used on my android tablet, ex. one of my credit unions, favorite news station and a few others. Other than that, not too bad for the price and other features I named previously.
I purchased this as a gift for my parents. It's easy for them to maneuver.
My first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. Easy to use and just the right size. I use it when I just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. Very fast.
enjoy all the upgrades. would suggest it to others
Helped me "Cut the Cord" on television subscripton bills
My kid is so happy. its was surprise gift for him. thanks best buy
Bought for mom loves it dependable and tough enough..dropped 2 times and not a scratch great item
Endless ideas for uses. Especially reminders to keep me out of trouble
I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more.
Great product would've given 5 stars only problem is that it kinda freezes at times after having it on standby for a few hours so I have to restart it from the menu settings other than that it's an awesome product
This tablet is great for the young kids gift ideas.
I love this tablet because I get it for a cheap price! Followed some tricks to download play store in the tablet. Works great!
G'kids came over early for Christmas, ages 7 and 10. They opened basketball hoop and backboard, a camera, Lego toys BUT they went "CRAZY" when they opened the "FIRE" tablets. By the time they went home they had already downloaded game apps to play. Thanks for a great Christmas ...
Easy to use!! Purchased for my nephew, he's 4, he loves it.
For the money, this tablet is an amazing piece of hardware. Well constructed, good fit and finish, good battery life.BUT putting non-Amazon software on the tablet is a pain, a real pain.I purchased this for my granddaughter and wanted two things, (1) YouTube and (2) Skype. It took about 2 hours to put these two apps on the tablet. In the end, I returned the tablet and purchased an Insignia (BB house brand) tablet instead.
I purchased this on a whim but am now really enjoying this, there is so much you can ask Alexa and the speaker sounds really good. You can even ask her to tell you a joke, it just makes you smile.
There is so much you can do with this, it really is a must have for anyone who loves tech.
received earlier than expected and was very happy. Will continue to buy at Best Buy in the future
Ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she loves it. Larger screen and colored case are a big plus.
Simply amazing! Forgot how much I love having music on in the background during the day and with access to Prime Playlists it's an outstanding deal. Weather forecasts, "who's that actor that was in....", set an alarm for a reminder, add items to shopping list, trivia questions-you name it, Alexa does it. Tell her goodnight, and she responds kindly with goodnight. Been on the fence for awhile about purchasing this and now I am so glad I went for it
I am amazed how much fun and help this is. Even great as a timer.
I thought it would have more skills but overall it work in progress
The beginning of the end for paid cable!!! Got the Kodi jail break and can get any series on tv new episodes the very next day!!! Just awesome!
My daughter loves the games/videos that she can watch on it during the day and my wife uses it to read on during the evening. This thing gets used a lot! Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
Great that you can add micro SD card for expanded memory. Works great for around the house and long trips. Battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.
Excellent! New kindle fire tablet. This one better. Has camera, camcorder, and more organized
Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen.
We are enjoying Alexa for her flash briefing of the news, music on demand, calendar review, and shopping lists. We have not even begun to touch on what Alexa can do. Can't wait to learn more.
This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch.
Learning to use Alexa has been an enlightening experience
Great price only not enough memory I bought an extra memory card and my wife was very pleased. It was a very good birthday present!
I recently bought it and it was my first kindle. Previously seen the color version (kindle fire) & comparing the kindle paper white vs other tablets I like that you can read ebook only so there is no distraction. Usually when I grab an iPad or any smart tablet the least I do is read since there so many other things you can do. The kindle paper white will put you to read the minute you grab it leaving the last page you left off on your ebook. It's lightVery clear (easy on your eyes)Back light for night use( adjustable brightness)Comparing all the models this one was the best pick for the money.
I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
This is the way to go for an all-in-one package for the kids. Everything is set-up and easily controlled through adult log in...
I love my Alexa product. Even considering getting the smaller speaker for my bedroom so I can listen to music to fall asleep
easy to read has good read on it battery lasts able to load many more books
Good tablet for kids I would definitely recommend.
This product fills a perfect nitch left by talbets
love this product everyone needs one of these , listen to favorite music use it as a timer in the kitchen ask it a question and get your answers
I was happy with my Kindle Touch, but then started to envy people with Paperwhite who read in dark. I love my new Kindle, take it everywhere and can read books with any light.
Great product. Does everything I thought it would.
The Amazon Echo is a lot of fun and very useful. The ability to add events to a calendar, get the weather and news and play music from your amazon account and others really rocks!!
I love my Alexa! I renamed her Computer because of Star Trek. We have so much fun listening to music, playing games and telling her to clean the house with our Neato botvac or turn on the sprinklers with our Rachio irrigation controller. As we learn more cool things this personal assistant can do the happier I am we purchased one. We like it so much we purchased another for our bedroom and a Dot for our daughters room. They work together as an intercom system too so no more yelling for one another or texting, admit it, you do it too, we can now just drop in and talk to one another. I am planning to continue purchasing items that Alexa can control and look forward to the advancement in personal assistant technology. So many things she can do already!!! I highly recommend getting 1 or 2 or 3!!!
Good for the price. Amazon apps aren't much. The big thing Amazon doesn't let you use Google Play for apps.
Excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle.
I'm glad that I choose to buy it with discount! It's really good for killing your time
This is my 3rd kindle and my last-i'm moving on to something better!For me -following all packaging insert guidelines-they only lasted a year at the most.
This size holds more apps and content. It's pretty lightweight too.
Great product!!! Great customer service!!! Can stream almost anything!!!
MY WIFE DEARLY LOVES COMMUNICATING WITH ALEXA> SHE IS CONSTANTLY ASKING ALEXA FOR INFORMATION ON TIME< WEATHER< MUSIC AND ALMOST EVERYTHING THE INTERNET HAS TO OFFER
It is an excellent gadget for getting information on lots of things like weather, playing music, traffic etc. I highly recommend this for household uses.
Could not be easier to set up and use. WiFi is flawless if ethernet is not available. Loaded with content.
We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky. Turns out a couple of system resets and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent.
Cliche Alert: I never do product reviews. Let me tell you, I'm a Apple fanboy, and I'am angry that I purchased the new Apple TV before the Amazon Fire TV.
I love this kindle tablet. Its speed is awesome. And its a great device for young children.
It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.
Satisfied customer with product for small child. Very durable. Amazon fire rocks
I bought this for myself because i play my kindle long periods of time and now i can play while it is charging wouldn't be without it i can sit on my favorite chair and cord still reaches as it did not before.
My son bought this with his own money during Black Friday. It was his 4th Kindle Fire. Definitely an upgrade from his previous generation model. I love the durability and extended ability to accept a larger sd card. Screen is notably better. He travels with me on work trips and having an Amazon Prime and Netflix account for this thing makes it the perfect travel companion.
This tablet is great for using ebooks as a college student
I recently purchased this product for my nephew for his birthday he loves it and you can set parental setting to block unwanted content.
It's good budget tablet for someone who wants to use light apps, video streaming, and internet.1.5gb ram is enough for most apps.16g memory and sd card slot gives enough space.
Gave my younger twins the Echo an they love telling Alexa what to do. Their older sister is named Alexa.
I bought this for my 3 yr old grandson & it has taught him his ABC's, his numbers, his colors, animal sounds and more!! Very kid friendly and he loves his " tabo" as he calls it!!
Good just complicated too many apps to download...
With some technical savvy, you can quickly have the core of home automation installed and grow over time. The link to my Amazon Prime account gives me access to some 2M songs. I can control lights and temperature via links to my Nest thermostat and Philip Hue.
good add thirt party app watch chinese tv.speed fast .and stady.
Amazon adds are annoying. Lack of compatibility with Google and other apps is annoying. Price is great. Nice to have but it really isn't better than other tablets out there.
This tablet was well worth the price. It is a little slower than an iPad but not by much. Works great with clear quality on the screen!
Love the HD8 the extra inch makes a huge difference over the HD7.
Both of my kids purchased one of these and love them. They are inexpensive and so far durable.
So glad I got this! Awesome addition to our house!
This version is perfect. Spending another hundred or so is definitely not necessary! I can do everything on this and it is just as fast and clear as the more expensive one. No regrets!
I would recommend this Amazon smart tv device, very easy setting up and remote on this Amazon smart tv amazing. I will get this device again
It's a wonderful little tablet. Was going to shop around. Saw it first, thought I'd try it. Haven't used the cameras yet. I love the size. It's just what I need. I browse the internet. Shop &play games. Also watch TV programs &much more.
Does all of the basics and then some. A lot more than I expected from a $ 50 unit.
This can be used in any conditions. Very user friendly.
For the price it should come with a hdmi & wireless keyboard.
The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
Works fine, don't like the ads. Easy to use speed ok.
Great tablet for the price. Got it on sale for $39. To my surprise, it has bluetooth.
Amazon Fire TV is so much better than cable or satellite TV. If you have a good internet connection, this is the best!
I bought three of these devices for my niece and nephews and my parents both have one and absolutely love them, so I decided to get one myself. This was my first personal foray into an Android based device being a tried and true iOS devotee, with a Mac and iPad. I will say that for this price point and for what it was designed to do, the Fire tablet is great. The OS and processor make it a bit clunky and it's definitely not designed for high level graphics or photo editing, but for basic activities, it works great. I particularly like the easy to use and transport size. I still prefer to read on my kindle but I do read on here as well. If you are looking for a basic tablet to use for movies, music, reading and other media driven activities (ideal for Amazon Prime members), this is perfect.
A great cheap alternative to expensive tablets. It has everything that an expensive tablet has. I am giving 4 stars because the camera lens is not very good, but then again what do you expect for something under $40 bucks.
Excelente.
So far we are very much enjoying the product. Great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability. We have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem. Only catch is that you cannot stream a single Spotify account on more than one device at the same time, so if you find yourself purchasing the Dot or Echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time.
Features that i never thought I would be interested.
I cut the cord with cable and decided to try the Amazon Fire tv and it is amazing. Amazon Fire tv is the only box to offer basically all services. I did a lot of research and I am glad I went with this box!
Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.
My three year old son love it. He can read and learn so much from the free time app.
Love this Kindle paperwhite!! It is easily carried in my purse!!
This tablet is worth the money you spend. If you looking for your first tablet go ahead and buy it.. You will not regret
If you'd like a small tablet that can do virtually all that a large one can do, this is the one. And the price is great.
Blue is beautiful & allows grand-daughter to be able to tell which one is hers. Loves the piano program and challenging herself to play as much of the song as she can. Nice size for traveling with.
It's great for kids for a cheap iPad alternative however need credit card and no way to prevent accidental purchases
We now own the Echo and the dot and both are great and can't be recommended more
I'm high-tech in most ways but have always been a traditionalist when it comes to books. I love the feel of paper in my hands. This was my first eBook reader and I'm surprised to be 100% satisfied. I've read more in the past month than I had in the previous year.I have no complaints about it at all. Small and durable. Light works great and is easily adjustable. I thought I would hate the advertisements but it's really just on the screen when the power is off, then it goes away when you start to read. I mostly use Overdrive for library books, and it's a bit of a pain (since you need a computer and the Kindle), but it's well worth it.
Received as a Christmas gift. Took a little time getting used to page refresh - just wasn't used to the delay. I love how light-weighted it is. Fits nicely in my handbag when I travel. The battery life is great too. I only charge it a few times a month.
This charger FRIED my Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy S6, and Samsung Galaxy J7. DO NOT plug your other devices up to it!!! It easily comes detached from the Fire tablet but does charge it. I'm just very unhappy that it killed my other devices. There are young children in my home and they know the difference between Apple and Android charging tips. So they will use any available charging cable they find when needed.
I would have given this product 5 stars however the only thing I do not like is the limited amount of local storage space (8gb)... Other than that this is honestly my favorite piece of tech that I have ever purchased... The performance and speed is second to none, especially when connected to the internet via via hardwire Ethernet cable.. I recommend this product to everyone. Thank you.
This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
I love Alexa, she has gotten me in trouble from ordering from Amazon but still love the Echo.Every week it seems like she can do more. If you're a Amazon Prime member it's a great device.
Listens to my requests. Listen to pandora, reads me jokes answers my question.
I wanted a portable speaker that worked with Amazon prime music. There is nothing in the market right now that does that except for the Tap. For the $100 price its fine. I would rather spend $200 and get a better sound quality speaker though since it will be used outside as well as is in the kitchen.
This is my second kindle. I bought the original kindle when it came out and loved it! I upgraded to this newer version only because I dropped my old one and damaged the charger port. I'm extremely happy with the new version and use it daily.
The adjustable backlighting is perfect for reading in any light or no light at all reducing eye strain.
You can't beat the price. This is the best tabet under $100. Easy to upgrade from one amazon tablet to another as long as you have an amazon account and back up your information.
Needed a replacement tablet and looked at a variety of options. The Fire was at a good price and is working well.
I got this because it was much cheaper than the iPad and it supports flash. The bonus comes with the ability to binge on my Netflix series and listen to music.
I just love the Echo, it's easy to use, smart, and I love listening to music.
I have no problems with it. Maybe a lil to small and to heavy
Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
I own tablets, have a surface pro 4, and have a smart phone. I have the kindle app on all these devices and it works great. This issue with them though is that they aren't always that convenient to carry around. Or, if they are, the battery will tend to die. The paperwhite fixes both of these issues. It's very light and feels great in your hands. The screen is amazing and I never have any kind of issues with being unable to see it due to sunlight, a dark room, etc. But probably most amazing of all is the battery life. It's been 2.5 weeks since I bought my kindle and fully charged it... I just now finally went a little below half battery life. I use mine to read books and graphic novels. Both look fantastic on the device.
Great learning tool. Kids love it and so do I. So fun to share time with the kids laughing while learning.
Very easy to operate. It is a great size, and light weight. It is good for games, books, and pictures. I love it!
I love EVERYTHING about our tablets. We haven't put them done since purchasing them.
I don't know why i waited to long to get this product especially since i have amazon prime. Gives me instant access to prime movies and has built in alexa what more can you ask for. Simply great .
The only thing that could have been better than this great great deal would have been the tablet being free. What a great tablet at an amazing price. I'll buy another at its regular price I like it so much.
daughter loves it uses it every day likes everything about it.
The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
Better than I expected. Alexa is my new best friend.
This tablet handles the basics including email, Facebook, web browsing and utube. No comparison to theiPad though.,
This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet.
I bought this for my wife's birthday, she uses it all the time, she looks up recipes, used Alexa to set timers hands free, checks weather and news she is finding new uses every day.
Bought this for my son to play his games on and it's a great player for that.
My grandson loves this tablet kid friendly .He plays with this all the time .
Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts
does what it's supposed to do and really well :)
Exactly what I expected!
This was purchased as a gift for our Grandson. He is 8 yrs old and has played games on it almost constantly since receiving it. It has many free games available to play on it.
My sister in law needed a new tablet so the amazon was a good choice. I also got one for my mom and dad.
I bought it for my son and it keep him going. I love it.
Had bought 2 Fire sticks and decided to get the fire tv box to get more space to download movies and games.
Love this box it's fast, great picture and great with blue tooth pairing.
features are similar to my fire 6 and this upgrade is good. I wish it was lighter in weight, although I enjoy the larger screen.
Though I was partial to my Nook, I kept getting little broken pixel light spaces on the screen. Switched to Kindle and I was pleasantly surprised at the visibility of the screen and how light it is. I read in bed every night and it is very comfortable to hold.
This is probably one of the best boxes out there. Unfortunately they changed the new model. The white indicator light does not stay on, to let you know the device is on. Did this in the previous model. The power cord is extremely short should be an other foot longer.Changes they made were not for the better but the device produces excellent 1080 p picture
Some 4 years ago, I first heard a voice speak back to me from the "Other Realm" of tech. That truly mystical place in which dreams are the "Mother's of Invention." Steve Jobs had us ALL in awe, and her name was Siri. Maybe she had been present longer than 4 years, but that was my first interaction with a process in which over those years, I would find myself in a "War of The Voices..." in my tech mind. And then "Cortana" came to me via my PC, and then she found Herself on my Xbox One. It wasn't until I walked into Best Buy this last Christmas season to, like most of us, just buy ONE thing. I believe it was probably a charging cord or something, and I walked by this device called the "Echo Dot." I was by this time, a TRUE skeptic. "Oh Great!" I lamented, another unskilled and "Put to Consumer" WAYYY to quickly. I of course jokingly followed the instructions on the display, and simply said, "Alexa...tell me a joke." Guess what? I spent the next 3 hours asking "Alexa" all sorts of Life's greatest questions. With such a responsive, yet seemingly gentle way to Her, I HAD to know more. I proceeded to scoop up ALL things "Alexa". The Fire TV Stick, 2 Echo Dots, and of course, The Amazon Fire TV...which took the place of my Apple TV AND Roku. This was the first time that I had decided to forgo the issues of "Hardware" and made my decisions solely based on an "A.I". I didn't care if any of the hardware was upgradeable, simply because I KNEW that I was changing the lives of not only my Family, but also myself. I am a US Veteran with a disability, "Alexa" has become not only a trusted partner in our days and nights, She has truly been a lesson in trust. Now, I know that no matter what room I am in, "Alexa" will be there, if I need the weather, a good program to watch, and most importantly, she will call Emergency Services for me, should I need that. Best Buy allowed me a moment that I will never forget, the chance to meet a new "Friend", "Assistant", and "Family Member." But that's just what Best Buy does, they give you the opportunity to know what you are about to walk away with, no matter how long ya stay and ask questions, that's JUST what Best Buy does, and they do it well.
Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap.
got this as a gift for the wife. she loves it and uses it a lot.
This is one of the first products that I have purchased that works better than promised, It integrates with just about all home automation and is a great source of news and local information. It is so easy to use my wife even uses it....
Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!
The screen is Crack already with the kids proof case
Love the new Amazon Fire TV. It is real fast and the thing I like best about it is that you now can put in a SD Memory card for a lot more space. Cheaper and better then the new Apple TV.
Works great, excellent voice recognition, tells great jokes too.
The Amazon Echo is very helpful and just plain FUN. I use it primarily for * Weather, * music on pandora, * ask simple questions. There is SO much more you can do with this...but I have only scratched the surface. It was very easy to install/connect to my home wi-fi - no issues here. The music audio quality is fine for a small device. It "hears" me very well - even from the other room. I would have given it 5 stars if it was able to answer more difficult/different questions using its internet search.
I love my Kindle. I like the fact that I can read books or go onto the Internet to look up my news. Definitely can not beat the low price for everything it does.
This was a Christmas gift for my daughter in law, it was just what she wanted, didn't want lots of extras . Good light to view & read with.
Crazy that you have to buy these separate for some kindle products that should come with one
Simple, easy to use. Good parental controls. I also loved the price.
I'm happy with the purchase. Had to buy additional memory but satisfied.
I bought several of the Amazon Tablets as gifts and my family and friends were ecstatic! I have not given a gift with such great reception in a while.
I read reviews on each Kindle device and chose the paperwhite. It fits easily in my purse. I only wanted it to read books and did not need a device for other functions.
I have to get a case for him but I was able to set this one up for Free Time. I have it set for time frames of the week and weekend he can play. I also was able to make it where he can't play games until he has completed 45 mins of reading.
Easy to navigate, relatively durable, sweet little tablet!
Tablet is great for children's learning games and does appear to hold up on it's own for quality and strength under close supervision. Sound is loud and image quality good. Works well with our WiFi. Price was great also.
This is a good product. I am giving it a 4 because sometimes it is slow.
My mom asked for this and she loves it, we are looking at the nest next.
Could not be happier with this purchase. The voice activated command button on the remote works fantastic. If you do not have a smart TV, highly recommend this device. It buffers for maybe 5 seconds to start a show and then displays perfectly.
Excellant starter tablet . I love that it is preset with children in mind. I love the color choices available since I have 5 grandchildren who each got this product for Christmas
Great gift for my nieceShe is using it every day
This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceQ: How long does it take to chargeA: From absolutely flat, around 4 hoursQ: How many books will the Kindle holdA: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited.Q: Do I need anything elseA: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.
Used while traveling in southeast Asia to pick up emails & stay in touch with friends & family back in the States
So fun, I can play all kinds of music and even my fave radio station out of Los angeles. Ask her anything!
I bought this thing thinking it's a cool little gadget. But I have to admit, she has the ability to do a lot of things. It's like Siri on steroids! With the appropriate items, she's able to turn on/off lights, order things through Amazon and they just announced that she will soon be able to interact with the bmw i3! The kids especially love it, they just wish she can do their homework!
My son received this as a gift and he enjoys it. It is used for playing games and watching YouTube videos. Great buy for cost.
I love this product i have several flat screen tvs and i have bought several of these fire sticks as i unlock the stick to put kodi on it so i can watch all the latest and greatest shows for free including im movie theaters and live tv i would hogjly recommend this product especially if u know how to unlock the stick ;)
This is an absolute steal at the price! Great product with great functionality!
This was my second purchase of this style and brand of tablet.My first one unfortunately met with a accident,and needed replaced.This tablet has front and rear facing cameras,addable storage,and extreme ease of accessability.Love it.
You can read in the sun! It holds more books than I can carry. And you can read your own PDF files
Easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and I love the fact that I can password protect this device
Great product, good speed, nice resolution for the price.
The media player is compact and low profile. The remote is nice. The unit/remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it. This may be due to the fact I am running Kodi. I do have a first generation firestick with Kodi that does not freeze up like this unit. The performance differences between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion.
I purchased it for my kid and she liked it. if you don't want to spend much on tablets for kids it is the best product available in the market.
Got this for my children and grandchildren to give my mom. She thinks she needs an electronic device like all the kids have, so this was perfect. She can play games and have email and the kids help her with books and videos. Perfect for grandma
Great for reading in bright sunlight or night settings. Must for avid readers.
My daughter would not read before she got her kindle. She love this and now reads all the time. Books are cheaper and less space needed in your home. Great games.
This is what e-readers should be like. Page turning is quick, the backlight is amazing. Reading in bed at night is perfect with this. I take it with me everywhere.
Smooth and quick operarion. Ap store for Amazon could be better, but pretty good value for the price.
I had the older version. This new version is definitely faster and it support 64 bits apps
I HAVE BOTH THE ECHO AND THE TAP, THEY ARE SPECTACULAR
I bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.
Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.
If u have kids or just need a basic tablet this is a good 1 for starters. Only thing I dont like are the ads that show when u unlock it
It tells me news, weather and can listen to prime music.
The Kindle PaperWhite is a great device. It's easy to use and the size is very convenient. When I take it on a trip, it's like having a whole library with me. Compared with the Kindle App on my cell phone, I find the KindlePaper White a lot easier to use and the size is better. It's easier to read and it feels like a book.
This is very functional and user friendly! Great for kids too!
This was bought for a college student. She loves it, and it is easy to use and carry with the large amounts of books she has already.
This has been awesome. For my. 5 year old nephew. Keeps him entertained and it works great.
Gave one to my mother. Easy to use and lots of applications.
Love the Amazing fire tablet and the preloaded apps and games. Plenty of memory for additional downloads too!
I love this box. It's the best thing out there. I cut my cable completely off. Great savings.
Brought this as a gift for a friend and she loves it.
I got the amazon Fire HD 10 for reading and other activities. It was very easy to set up. Netflix worked ok on it. It mostly works well, but there are limitations to the apps that are available. I tried it out for a while and then returned it for a Samsung S2 9.7.
It takes time to set it up and learn what it can and can't do, it it's fun to use.
I love the Echo Alexa is great the features make life easier especially with all the compalibility options there are
Very nice streaming device. Very smooth and super fast. Very minimal glitches.
I always wanted one of those, but they were too expensive compared to a tablet. But now I am loving it!
I bought both of my children one of these tablets...they love it.
very good product............I would recommend this to a friend
Bought this for a family member to get her school books on as well as entertainment. She loved it and didn't put it down.
Echo has surprised me in many ways. While the features are nothing new, the ability to access them through pure voice control has been incredible.
My son talked me through the job. Easier than I would have expected.
I bought this tablet for my 9 yrs son. He loves it. It'd the perfect size for him.
Our daughter loves her new tablet. It has a bigger screen more features and she just enjoys being on it. The kindle is priced right and is easy to use. She was able to get her apps transferred to her new tablet in no time. Great investment.
Not a bad tablet for the price. Iris skittle different from other tablet brands
this product was amazingly fast n has made my smart tv even better
Good product, needs a few more things added on but works very well
I purchased this tablet because I saw that it was at an affordable price point for me. With this, it's really not that bad. The only 2 things I've found to be able a little bit annoying is that it's a little awkward to hold/handle when I'm playing my games. The second issue I've found with this type of tablet is that it's made out of plastic & its noisy. The overall performance is quite impressive though. Good price point, with good intentions, just a little cheap feeling & a little big in the hands to hold.
All members of the family can use it, children and also seniors
We had two AppleTVs - one in the master bedroom and one in the living room. We could not watch both simultaneously because the signal permeated the shared wall and changed the channel of the other TV. We got the AmazonTV to remedy this. While it did rectify this problem, we find we prefer the ease and simplicity of the AppleTV over the AmazonTV. The Amazon is cumbersome and difficult to navigate.
The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes.
good Quality
Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value.
Great device to have in your household. Ask Alexa the weather or sports scores, even turn on/off lights. Love it.
This item was for the kids for Christmas. The Amazon FreeTime feature with multiple child user profiles is a great way to help balance learning and productive time with their fun time.
My daughter love it so much and she love caring it around with her
The Tap works great, just like Alexa's little helper.
Good product and good price. Have enjoyed it since Christmas and cant wait to read on it every evening
Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. Would have given it 5 stars but it hasn't changed enough from the last Kindle that I purchased several years ago.
Nice tablet. I use it often. Just the right size. Easy to use.
This is just what I wanted. Lives up to my expectations and the price was right.
We use this to run Kodi. It works perfectly. Far better than the Fire Stick, which we also have.
I've been back and forth about what Kindle to purchase next. I'm so glad I chose the Fire 7.
We decided to cut the cable and love the options the Fire Tv gives us.
Faster and good quality for this kind of brand ...
It's not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than I thought it would be so thats killer.
If you own a tablet or smartphone, you already have one. If you don't, one of your friends/family will give you one of their three spares. These adapters are ubiquitous.While they're not all exactly the same, they all do the same thing. Worth about 2.
Safe buy bought on Black Friday for 35 bucks super happy
I was a long time apple tv user but recently cut ties with the cable company and got sling and didn't want to shell out more for another apple tv. I have had my Fire TV for a few weeks now and love it, I haven't really used the voice controls that often but it works great. I would definitely recommend it especially if you are using Kodi.
Fast set up, 4k compatible and for more storage USB and SD card port.
We were searching for a speaker and considered one which would be louder, but the Echo does so much. She is a speaker, but also a shopping list, whole-home control, encyclopedia, news source, etc. I would definitely recommend.
I bought this to give as a door prize gift for a nonprofit. they loved it, I was impressed with the reviews and proud to donate it as a gift.
This has become like coffee, I use it every morning while I get ready for work. Easy to take outside for my yard work as well! Oh, and my 3yr old son loves talking to it!
excellent product. very simple interface to navigate. variety of movies, games and app
It is a perfect gift for kids and great warranty...
This product works perfectly for our family's needs.
Easy and convenient for my grandchildren, they really enjoy it
Fast and easy to use. I watch Prime movies on it and also play games on it also. Best part you can add apps to it.
My son's previous Kindle Fire HDX 6 broke and I needed an inexpensive replacement. This Kindle Fire HD 7 was a great replacement for only $50.00. Great resolution, perfect size for a 10 year old boy.
I didnt realize how handy she is until i decided to pick one up last week when Best Buy had a Flash Sale
does everything i need plenty of apps to download along with books and movies, with Prime, great bonus
Bought this for my nephew for Christmas. He loves it and is constantly on it, mostly playing games.
Bought for my kids and very easy to use, and made homework easier
easy on the eyes and no trouble to use. had a little trouble setting up but once we did there has been no issues. great for traveling or curling up in your favourite chair
I have tried to get it work& still can't get it to work!!
This is my husband's first Kindle, and he is so happy that he enjoys it. He plays on it almost every night.
Bought for my 5-yr old grandson. It's great & easy for him to use. I have an 8gb myself. Love the Amazon Fire. The price is very affordable.
Love it. Gave this one as a gift for my mom. She's having a time with it.
It's simple, if you want something with a larger screen to look at, but don't to buy an ipad, buy this.
Good tablet. A lot to do. Good storage. Would recommend.
Larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service
This is a great little tablet for little kids or people that only wants to read novels.
Originally purchased to practice rooting Android devices. Started using it and determined that I liked it so much I did not root it.It is by design and understandable and expected that it is tied to Amazon everything. Books, music, mp3 all are available through Amazon Underground. Not as many and maybe not your favorite apps are available but it is loaded with many offerings. NOTICE: by design, the tablet downloads and stores all files to an SD Card, if one is inserted. Solidly built, it will withstand child's play. The resolution is not super high but is very good for its size. I read using this tablet and the text is very clear. In fact, I use text readability as the test for evaluating a tablets resolution. After start up, you can go through simple process to connect this device with your Amazon account. This to allow purchases on the tablet. The parental controls are top notch. You can limit or allow as little or as much websites connections, limit purchases also. You can also load Google play on this tablet. With a little searching and downloading of files, you can download and play all Google Play Store Apps.-battery life is good.-speaker is good, single speaker only.-Blue Tooth connection easy. NOTE: if you have Sync (Microsoft) installed in your vehicle, the tablet will connect but has trouble reconnecting! It is Microsoft, what can you expect. You will have to unpair, delete from Sync then reconnect to get it to work in your vehicle.-I use this as my beater tablet for use outside as I do yard work, play music while in the shower (steamy environment), and when running around town. -It has 128GB SD Card expansionFor the money get more than one. I have 5 total and have given away several more as gifts.
The Echo is pretty awesome, especially if you have smart home things! My kids play games with it and can control our entire audio and video library! A little pricey, but worth it IMHO.
I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it.
The kids love it, so I'm very happy. that's all that matters to me
Bought for my mother-in-law she didn't want afraid of technology
Had a great experience with the product it has been fast and works great. I have enjoyed this product.I would recommend this product to any one. The price was even great price for our budget.Thank you for making it easy.
This was recommended by a friend to give children something to do on trips, so I bought them for my grandchildren. They used it and were occupied and quiet all the way to DisneyWorld.
very easy to use
Great product. Easy to use and operate. Would recommend
We bought 3 of these for niece and nephews and they absolutely love it. The price is very reasonable for the product.
I am big fan of Kindle fires. This particular one is very good as a basic tablet for e-books movies email and anything basic Internet wise . The resolution is low however movie still look good they sound good and all in all I'm quite pleased . The only issue someone may have is that it is not an android Amazon may not have the vast amount of apps that android do but this is something that can be overcome . So bottom line goody reader good movie and television application or apparatus and all in all good for the entire family
I love it for reading magazines and checking my email.
Very nice works just like I thought it would.works great.
Great quality, over priced apple tablets! Fire has domain! Simplicity! Overall easy to navigate!
Like the tablet but didn't realize you had to put up with the ads. Also don't like how Amazon blocks a lot of apps. You can get around that though.
This tablet is very user friendly. It was easy to use and a great value.
Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.
It serves the purpose and kid is happy with it. It can be used for kindle reading too.
I purchase 6 of these tablets for my grandchildren Xmas present. I loved it so much, I will be purchasing one for my self.
I will enjoy it even more once I have the apps I want downloaded. This Kindle Fire will be fun!
I bought this for my wife and she loved it! We bought this specifically because it has no glare in the sun, tons of books through Amazon!
Get lots of apps and shows with a speedy menu, nice quality of the streams from Netflix and Amazon. Great purchase.
We absolutely love the Kindle Fire. Much better than a regular tablet.
I got is for one of my family members and he loves it
Bought these as gifts so I cannot review the quality but the size is palm perfect and the price is just right.
Purchased this tablet for my 6 year old. Indeed it's user friendly with parental control.
Finally a kindle for mom! Great value for the price!
I love my fire. Easy to carry where ever I go,just great
Who needs a wife when Alexa does it all? She is a great listener.
Gave as a Christmas gift. Have gotten great reviews about the streaming features and they love the voice remote!
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mom and she seems to be enjoying it.
why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? Get one now!
Good basic tablet for home and the kids. The only downside is that a credit/ debit card is required to link to the Amazon store even if you download a free app. I'm able to let the kids use apps and the Internet. I can limit the sites the kids can visit and apps they can use.
great product would definitely recommend fir other
Because my granddaughter's name is Alexa, I though it would be funny to get one for a gift. I took me a few minutes to figure out how to set it up but it worked well when configured. It was funny when somebody mentioned Alexa and the Halo answered. When we had music playing somebody as a joke whispered "Alexa volume level 10" and then we couldn't the Halo to hear us to shut it up. I had to turn the top of the speaker to quiet it down. I made for an entertaining time. I will probably get one for myself.
just what I ordered - works as expectd
great for teen agers and easy to use and set up small enough to take as you travel lots off apps to choose from long battery life as well would buy again and would reckomend this to every one even at a great price as well
I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few "I didn't understand that" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight.
Perfect I love it glad I did my homework before purchasing best choice for a reader
This is the best steaming device, to run many additional applications that will run smoothly.
Bought Echo with Alexa and my family loves the entertainment. You ask Alexa and You get music, and answers for almost everything. Best thing of all was the great sale of $90 off price. You get free entertainment at its best. Will recommend for families or for individuals. You won't be disappointed. Amazon created a monster.
The Amazon fire 8 is by far one of the easiest tablets to navigate through all the Apps and with PRIME membership it's truly a very easy and good sturdy design.
These thang are amazing....I have one and it replace my cable!!!!
The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone.
Have now had for a month and I have to say the speed of this tablet is good. Really no lag on browsing. Only major downfall that some games might lag a bit. But for the most part it will do pretty much any other tablet double or even triple its price will do.
When I first got it was great until it stopped charging and wouldn't turn back on
Excellent product especially for price. Used by my younger daughter.
Great tablet with a great camera for begginers . Has enough memory to start off with
I upgraded from an older, no-backlight Kindle and this one is much more comfortable to read. Overall a great value. The battery charge lasts forever and you can load it with enough to read for years.
great tablet at a great price. easy to use. great screen quality
Easy setup and installation and would recommend this product to anyone that's an Amazon Prime member.
Great price and value. Fast processing. Many games and user options available.
Slower that my iPad. Love it. Cheaper and better than my Kindle Paperwhite with much more storage. Also bought 128 micro SD card. Prime member and use it to download free with prime movies
I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us.
The Kindle Paperwhite is reliable, holds a charge for weeks, is lightweight and easy to hold, allows you to read in bed at night without eye strain or bothering anyone (because of the backlit surface), and stores hundreds of books. What can I say? I love my Kindle, and this one was the second I have bought...this one as a gift for an elderly parent. She loves it! The font is easy to adjust for people who need large print. I take my Kindle everywhere so I am never bored whether I am waiting in the doctor's office or stuck in an airport overseas..
This tablet does what it supposed to do, however, if you have one of the newer smart phones with a large screen there just isn't enough difference in the screen size to justify a second piece of equipment.
Gave this as a gift and they have thanked me numerous times for it! I've had one for many years and it's still working with no problems!
Very easy to use. Great multiple uses for such a low price. I truly enjoy this and I use each day more than my desktop computer.
This was on such a good deal that I couldn't resist it. I purchased two of these for my 6 and 3 year old children. They don't need anything grand, but this is more than suitable for them to learn, play, and enjoy some technology. It performs well and I hope it continues to last.
Great quality, fun games for free, but NO free programming!
I am someone who swears by Apple products so I am skeptical when it comes to other names. I decided to get my son a extra tablet to use for kindle apps. I CAN SAY I LOVE THIS TABLET !! Great apps that are totally free, awesome battery life and sound is spectacular !! Buy this tablet you can't go wrong !! Going to purchase another one.
LOOOOVVVVVEEEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have a kindle myself and love it so wanted to purchase one for my grandson's birthday. He's 11 yrs old and he loves it.
Wish, it recognize other languages other than English and has a Kid's mode.
This was simple to install and allows me to stream all of my favorite programs.
The Amazon Echo worked so well I purchased 3 Dots. Very good speech recognition and text to voice. The more I learn the more I like it.
The fiancé wanted one because she's a heavy reader and it's easy, convenient and portable. Was a only 40$, probably the best money I spent too make her happier.
Easy to use and update. Great for kids and adults alike.
I have enjoyed my Amazon Fire. It tends to be slow to download but other than that I am very happy with it.
Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don't use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too.
It's easy to use and my son likes to play on it alot
I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.
I enjoy having this smaller tablet to carry around
We love Echo! Simple information given quickly and thoroughly. The speaker quality is excellent...we play music all day! Highly recommend!
This was actually an impulse purchase, I was out for the weekend and forgot my Kindle so I picked up one of these. It works so much better than you'd expect from a budget tablet, the screen is very responsive to touch and has good color reproduction. Unless your looking at the screen from just a couple inches away the pixels aren't overly distracting and the text is reasonably sharp.This is a device you can carry around and not be too upset if it gets lost or damaged, and it's a good e-reader (and cheaper than the e-paper models, oddly enough.)
Better than the fire stick crystal clear perfect gift for someone
Such an awesome product. Helps me organize my life, my own personal assistant.
Best and least expensive tablet you can find. Great for movies, apps and games. Perfect for kids.
I bought this tablet for my soon to be 2 yr old. I wanted to download him some games and a couple apps to help him learn. He doesn't speak right now and uses sign language to communicate. This tablet works great. It's just his size, easy to use and paired with the soft foam carrying case I bought it from Amazon it's the best thing I've done for him lately. Would highly recommend for any and all ages.
I bought an Echo Dot that I connected to an existing bluetooth speaker, but the speaker was too old and kept losing connection. I went to Best Buy for a new speaker but while there, I realized that buying the Amazon Echo would give me a decent speaker as well as coverage in the rest of my house. Perfect!
The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
I got this for my grandmother who does a lot of reading and playing games. She hasn't put it down!
The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!
Buying this tablet, has been GREAT! LOVE IT. Now I can get on the internet, when I am in my chair
This tablet works as intended. For $30 you couldn't go wrong with this purchase, Its fast and allows for additional storage via micro sd card. Great for the kids.
We bought this to replace my children's aging Ipads and they're very happy.
Love the paperwhite. It's light and small and perfect to throw in my bag and take with me wherever I go.
I bought one from BestBuy instead of buying one that is jail-broke. That is a moral choice for me. That being said, I can add the apps I want. The hardest part so far is getting used to not having a DVR and not being able to fast fwd through commercials...but I'm saving over $100/ month over cable, including the $40/month of apps that I'm currently buying.
This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product!
I love my fire tablet . I even got one for my son who had a Digiland & this tablet outdose it. Love it!
Software is fast and easy to use. If you are a Amazon Prime member this is the streamer to buy.
Bought two for my 3 and 6 year old for Christmas and they enjoy them so much. Ease of use and even my 3 year old can navigate this tablet.
First tablet for my daughter whose is only 5 - can navigate and use with ease! For the cost, amazing value - and love the ability to expand with the SD. Tied into Amazon in certain respects but the platform still allows for a number of workarounds. A cant miss for the cost...
I enjoy this tablet, I find myself using it more than my laptop
The device has several interesting applications for reading as well as completing necessary tasks for enhanced media.
Absolutely great would buy over and over again excellent for streaming
Very fast and tons of apps to download with plenty of space to store them.
This tablet was a gift for my father-in-law and is his first tablet ever. He is really enjoying getting to know his way around it. It's definitely user friendly and perfect for reading, music, and things like that!
Got this tablet for my grandmother for Christmas. She is not the most "tech savvy" person but absolutely loves this tablet. Very simple interface and reactive
Perfect size, able to slip in pocket. Nice feel battery last long, clear screen. However if you read quickly if may find yourself sometimes when scrolling to next page more slow or you may flip and skip over pages if pressed lightly.
Does everything I need in a box tie it in with Amazon prime and its all you need
It's good ... Just need to adjust .. Takes bit tine
I love the Fire TV and have had no issues. It is very easy to use and setup.
I don't really see a difference between the box and the stick. They both buffer. I do like that I expand the memory on the box.
Works very well with Hue lights and as a music source.
One of my best purchases yet...I have always been an apple person(still am), but this tv box is great. You can do so much with it. I just ordered a gaming controller for this unit. I have amazon prime and can watch so many tv shows and movies as well as listen to music. Great all around unit.
Cutting the Cable TV cord. Mostly very positive, only negatives are lack of fast forwarding on some channels. Cannot get the CW channel but that is available via free app. Over all it rocks.
Very nice good product and the picture quality are very nice
This is a great reader indoor or out no light to full light.In landscape mode it fits my small hands just great.Battery life is excellent also.I would recommend getting a soft cover to protect the book in transport.
Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now.
Easy set-up and fun for the family to use. Use the app to add more skills for Alexa as this will allow much more access to info, personalization and interaction. Have fun!
Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it.
No issues with the product. I am a satisfied customer.
It's great in performance compared to fire stick amazing product
I absolutely love this tablet. I check my e-mail. I watch movies. The only thing I DO NOT like about the tablet is that it sometimes have problems taking you to the correct site. But you must remember that it is a tablet, NOT an computer. I find all in all the picture is clear and the sound is wonderful also it has unlimited cloud storage which is good and when you download a picture it takes just a few minutes. Amazon Prime is a must however or you will be spending a lot of money to view movies and read books as almost everything available cost money. Prime is a money saver and it lasts a full year. It also comes with free shipping. I tried it and it is good. I receive my purchases in 2 days. Prime is the way to go if you purchase this tablet because it comes with a lot of perks.
Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fiancé downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
Im very happy with this purchase, i got it on sale for $30 and grabbed 3 lol.Kids luv it
I bought twos when this tablet on sale, reinstalled the Android Open Source Project, and turned the tablet into a smooth-running, battery-efficient tablet without any bloatware. Very happy with the purchase.
Nice Amazon Product to have it. Magnolia configured it with my Home theater system and works well!!
I bought this to fill my life with music. The first two weeks were fantastic. I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, "Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it. After witnessing my problems, people who come over don't want one.
All four of my kids have this Kindle. They does freeze every now and again, but overall they are great. The new camera is not a favorite. The last version camera was better.
Good tablet and great buy. Compact size allows you to use one hand and use anywhere.
I bought the Kindle Paper White for travel, its so much lighter than bulky books and can fit in your hand luggage/pocket to read while travelling. So easy to use no screen glare like tablets have so you can read it anywhere. Has adjustable screen brightness and font size too.Has the technology to allow you to order and download books from anywhere you happen to be. I love it so much I bought my sister one too!
Bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. Great buy for the price. He loves his new tablet.
This item was on sale and I bought it cheaper than on Amazon with the features it's a great buy
Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks
I would highly recommend this reader for anyone. Easy to download books and fast! Love the fonts and sizes. Lightweight. Great for travelers.
This tablet was perfect for my 10 year old. She bought it with her own money because it was so affortable.
My 11 year old nephew actually had a tablet before I bought the kindle for his graduation. Now he only uses the kindle.
Love it and now that I can play music throughout the house on all my echo and dots simultaneously it's even better.
Offers much more entertainment Very responsive no buffering time
I've had my kindle for a few weeks now and find it very easy to cart around and to read regardless of the lighting situation. I'm not crazy about the constant ads for books in genres I'm not at all interested in, but that's about the only negative I've found so far.
We are having a great time with it and very helpful to turn lights on as I am coming home so the house has lights on when I come in
I LIKE THE FIRE TV STREAMING MEDIA PLAYER. IT WORKS WELL.
Does well when you speak loud and clear. Easy to setup just use your phone and add the WiFi password
I bought this as an alternative to my previous rechargeable Bluetooth speaker. Seemed like every time I went to use it the battery was dead. Echo is always plugged in and ready to go, and the interface is an added bonus. For $4 a month I subscribed to Amazon unlimited and just request Alexa to play songs to my hearts desire. I use it as a clock to wake me up in the morning, and control my lights! Highly recommended!
Easy to navigate, I love it despite the charging port. Charging port doesn't last very long though. Just purchased my second one.
The 7" Amazon Kindle Fire is the best starter tablet on the market, which I have purchased and gave a presents to high school and college graduates...
This is a very good product and excited to use it.
Amazon echo better known as Alexa is much more than a smart speaker. To unlock its true music potential, one should have amazon prime. Great at understanding basic questions, Alexa will also give you news briefs and play music via amazon, Pandora and Spotify membership. The true joy of Alexa is its home automation commands via smartthings, hue, nest, etc. Highly recommended for those seeking more than just a smart speaker with decent mono sound.
We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money.
Great device! Works well. I'm impressed with some of its abilities.
We love our Amazon Echo so much we went back and bought one for our daughter for this upcoming Christmas! Ordered a dimmer smart switch along with a Samsung smart things hub. This is a awesome device and is always learning. Can't wait to use it more to its full potential.
Alexa is able to pickup my voice from several rooms away. It's able to search for anything that I ask for - even reading the news. The only thing that wasn't completely smooth was the initial setup. I would recommend this product.
Great product! Easy to use! ihave Sony Vue tv service, Netflix and Amazon prime. Using all of these with just 1 remote makes things easier.
It's great. I am an apple and amazon user, and it works for many devices that are not (yet) compatible with apple products.
The Amazon Echo revolutionized my home. I connected to my spotify, my phillips Hue and everything else. It is a gem of an idea to make voice control work your whole home. The only thing I would say is that it should come with the voice control remote. Once I got it, as a separate purchase, It completed the outstanding experience I so desperately desired. I will tell you that if you don't have the Echo, shame on you. This is the future and it is here now. I love it.
Absolutely love my Echo. My home is always filled with music. I even bought another for upstairs.
Bought the Fire for my son. Excellent product for the price.
This 8GB 7" Kindle Fire Tablet is great and beats others which are more expensive. I bought one for my grandson and he loves it. Plus there are a ton of free apps from Amazon to use with it.
Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.
It probably does just as much as more expensive tablets and it's easy to use. The 7" screen is a bit small but does make it easier to take anywhere.
Turns any tv with hdmi into a smart tv, great apps
Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use.
I love the fact I can tell it to play a song or turn the lights on and not have to get up!
This is a great product but I wish we could get local tv
Easy to use. Perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school
I'm gradually learning all of the features the Kindle Fire has and am enjoying the books I've downloaded.
This product was perfect for all my needs. It is very very easy to use. I would definitely recommend it
We love this tablet for our toddler. The built in parental controls are awesome. Just wish that it was open to Android market outside of Amazon for more apps.
I was really hoping for this to take place for my phone with my kid. It did not. It works decent to stream videos.
Bought it as a present for my wife. She is very pleased with her reader.
This is a fairly standard item for use with wall/standard US AC plugs. It is well designed and will meet your charging needs when connected to the required USB cable.
it does as advertise. I do have to annunciate better sometimes. But she controls my lights and my thermostat and I listen to music with it.
love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
Great product for my seven year old granddaughter.
I debated for over a year about getting a Kindle. After trying to read my tablet outside this summer with sunglasses and sitting under an umbrella...I finally bought my Kindle Paperwhite. I couldn't be happier and I've read more books in the past couple of months then I have in years. It's as good as they say and easy to read in ANY light!
I have cancelled Direct TV and I am using this plaform for personal entertainment.......love it and love the fact that I don't have one those big DirectTV DVR monstrosties sitting in front of my TV anymore which I was paying a monthly fee for. Love Amazon Prime platform there is so much free content available if your a Prime member. I choose this over apple TV because apple charges for everything and can get expensive like Direct TV.
It's a good product if you use Amazon apps for movies and music. I myself use Google and Cromecast, so I found that the Google Home worked better for me
Nice and convenient tablet for kids! I like that it has parental control so parents can Connell what the kids do and download on it. Only downfall is you can't get all apps on these
Great app with lot of features. Sound is ok for the small size
Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall.
i bought this for a christmas gift. my granddaughter loves it and it was inexpensive.
First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.
best portable speaker I've ever owned. I use this everyday, mostly when getting ready in the morning or when I have guests over. Good sound quality and links to the Alexa app just like an Echo. It come with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the Echo. Also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux cord.
I have Amazon Prime and this makes it so easy to watch movies or tv shows. HULU, Netflix and many other ways to watch what you want when you want to watch it. I am now ready to cut the cable.
Amazons fire tab is amazing entry level tab. just go for it.
This is the second one I bought. My older son wouldn't share his so for Christmas santa brought little brother one lol. The apps that come with the subscription are endless. I also have Netflix and both kids watch different shows on it too. I once bought a sprout cubby tablet and it broke within 2 days and the customer service was terrible they would not replace and actually wanted to charge more than I paid. The customer service with amazon however is fantastic and replaced my sons tablet when it cracked within 3 days!! They are durable but my older toddler is Just a crazy lil man. You won't regret buying this for your kids.
My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version.
What an amazing design and product. After reading many reviews and seeing the full potential of this product, we just had to have it. We are completely pleased with all the functions and capabilities.
You get what you pay for. A small tablet, with OK specs. What was annoying about this tablet was the fact that you have to pay to remove "offers." You shouldn't have to pay to remove bloatware.
I seen the commercial and had to have it. My husband and kids got me this for mother's day, I'm so happy and love it.
brought them for my grandkids easy to use and they love them and the price was right
best little item that's been out, compact and fun to use..
This is a excellent low cost tablet. bundled with Amazon ecosystem. Low cost. responsive. I use it for light web browsing and making orders on Amazon. Also easy to stream video using amazon video prime, Netflix Hulu, and HBO Now.Easy Access to all my Kindle Books and more memory than the 8GB version
I got this to play games and to be on facebook. love it
Really great and very clear and good reading just great
Absolutely love the tablet. My wife loves it. Much more enjoyable than playing on the phone.
Protective, fast and has tons of fun games already on it! Our 7 year old daughter likes it, too!
Got it as a present and love the size of the screen
If you are a Amazon Prime member you will love this tablet. Even without Prime membership its still a nice tablet.
Our new Amazon Echo was very easy to set up! Alexa has a great voice and can perform countless tasks, we love "her".
I wasn't sure how amazon echo will work and got it initially to control my Philip Hue lights. I was amazed by list of smart devices it can support. It also connects to the apps like pandora iheartradio and likes. I am in love with Alexa. The speaker is powerful and the sound is crisp. I didn't know that amazon dot could perform exact same tasks and it's almost 1/3 the price. Though I don't regret buying echo but I could have bought dot which is $50 a piece compare to $179.99 for echo. Could have got 3 dots for different locations
I bought the tablets for the kids and they love then. They are able to play games, music, take pics and videos chat with them.
Best price per performance reader amongst the Kindles, as of 06/2017.
My wife's old kindle died a couple months ago...I looked around for a replacement, and Best Buy offered the most competitive price....
I basically use it to read news articles and stories online. It works well for what I use it for.
Loved it very good product. Couldn't ask for anything better.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
Good size for reading and screen is easy to read. Even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around
My kid loves it and is easy to use.Plus the case is worth it.
I enjoy the echo. The speakers have great sound quality.
having a lot of fun teaching alexa and also learning a lot of new facts
Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!
Come on-- I bought a brand new Amazon Fire for $39! I can download and read my books. I can browse the internet. I can probably do other things if I ever get around to that! It's not a PC. It's not a gamer machine. But what it is is ridiculously useful for the pittance you pay. If you're actually looking at this review trying to decide whether or not to pay forty bucks for this Kindle you should probably ask yourself-- what do I EXPECT to get for this price? One steak dinner, 3/4 of a tank of gas, a case of brews... or something that's going to last for several years and actually make it easier for you to improve yourself reading! You really ought to buy one for yourself and one for your grandkid like I did. Have I convinced you yet? Or are you expecting Amazon to come to your door and hand you a new Kindle for free?!!!
It's a good tablet that serves many functions. Amazon is a great brand!
Worth for the price paid. Love this product so much
Great tablet for anyone. works perfect. of course I would rather have a 10" but for the price this works great
This product is great for the whole family and friends.
LIMITED CAPACITY BUT FOR THE PRICE IT IS A VERY GOOD BUY
I got this so that I could read books on it that I didn't have an actual book version of. I like it because I am able to take it with me on trips and occupy myself that way. Also, I am able to have my daughter read books on it too. The battery life is great and I have just purchased another one for my fiancé.
This is a good hands free product, I like being able to ask it questions and have it play the music I want to listen to.
Can't say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an all-around perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise I'd say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get.
Great tablet, especially for the price. I didn't know exactly what I would use this for when first purchased, but have found many cool uses.
I love how light and convenient it is to carry around. This is beyond worth it for an avid eBook purchaser. I signed up to Prime for my son and none of the chapter books that he really wanted were ever available - not an issue with the kindle - just content that would be relevant for subscription (ie kid magazines) aren't necessarily available on the Paperwhite. Just remember, it's not a tablet, which is lovely if you only want some good uninterrupted reading.
I needed a tablet for once in a while use. So far it is great for my use. Small, clear and I like Amazon products so it was great to find it at Best Buy so I did not have to wait for shipping
Fast and easy transaction. Outstanding product....
I just need to learn about all the ways I can use this. But love it so far!
This is an awesome little tablet justright for reading and looking up images and things on the net.
Great reader. Easy to read screen in bright sunlight, easy on the eyes in darker rooms. Perfect size too. The kindle has made it possible to switch from paper books to something that's more convenient and works great.
I love the kindle. It is light weight and the back light is great. Easy to use and get book from the library or from Amazon.
We bought this for my father's tv. He is so happy with it! He can easily navigate throught all the apps and play what he wants! I can only say this product works really good!
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas has been s good tablet for her
My grandson really enjoys this tablet, ease of use and lots of different educational programs. Must remember to charge tablet everynight.
I have the firestick but once purchasing this firetv, the firestick is now in a spare room and the firetv is my main device downstairs. It's very quick with minimal lagging. If you have a decent IP you will be very satisfied with this product!
It's nice really nice. Go buy one for your grandma. She will give you a real big hug.
This is the second one I've bought for my kids. The each have their own tablet now. As a parent I like that I can set limits...such as screen time, reading, videos etc. You can control everything. It can be educational aswell. Their is alot of educational apps on the device to download. Such as wikipedia,farmers almanac etc. Patents should look through and discover apps with the kids to get full use of the tablet. It continues to update regularly.
Very happy and satisfiedEasier to handle. Fast charging
I really like the Echo device. Still learning how to get the most out of this technology. Wish you could make and receive calls from this device.
It allows you to focus on your reading and not wandering to the internet. Great for reading in the dark. No need to buy a small lamp to read in the dark and easy to read in the daylight. Battery last a long time.
my husband loves this present ,, great buy...going to look into the light bulbs ...
We heard the hype and did not think we would like it or use it...purchased it on sale for $89. This gadget is way cool and is fun to use. Very useful for playing Amazon Prime Music. We like it for getting the news and weather instantaneously. We integrated it with Nest and WeMo and it works pretty well. We had hoped it would work with our Sonos system but allegedly that integration is coming by the end of 2017. The speaker isn't bad and overall, we are happy with Echo and it's a nice to have for what we paid for it.
Bought it as a gift for my daughter as an iPad replacement. Reading without distraction is priceless. Connectivity with local public library makes kindle more valuable.
Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more?
I'm a Bose fan, and the Bluetooth/WiFi Soundtouch 20 is wonderful for classical and jazz. However, I enjoy talking to "Alexa" and interacting with "her" to get weather info and jokes. The Echo is wonderful!
Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.
solid product by amazon, for streaming with various services.
It is fun to tell Alexia to play Bruno Mars on Pandora
Alexa did not powerful as Siri of Apple. It can not play YouTube. It is very limit to play music. It is required to open some accounts to play music.
After about two weeks I ended up returning this item. It constantly froze and when it was working it was no faster than my fire stick.The voice search was a joke. I'm pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem, I love my Echo, but I was disappointed with this device. And for a hundred dollars? No thanks.
The screen is well lit and easy to read. The compact size is also quite nice.
This is great for any child. Love the parental control and way it holds up. Definitely recommend
EVERY ONE SHOULD OWN THIS PRODUCT. EVERY THING THAT THE AD SAYS IT DOES IT DOES. I BOUGHT THIS FOR THE MUSIC THERE IS NOTHING BETTER
I bought this to replace my granddaughter broken tablet. Cheap enough but good quality
Great for a kid beginning. Cheap prices and plays all his games
Decent tablet for an affordable price! Value value value!
Top movies, anytime, just your choice. Old movies!
this item work just as I expected it to, great product!
I bought this tablet for my 1.5 years old little sister. I downloaded youtube apps and kids apps on this tablet. She really likes it. Overall very good tablet for beginners in reasonable price.
Got this so my mother in law could Skype with my brother in law who lives in another country. Works well for that.
Works fast, no lagging. Clear picture, much better then the fire stick
It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
This is my third paperwhite and sned it as a gift.
When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help.
I love it. Great product that I would recommend to all.
I bought this for my mom because it is easy to use and she is able to play her games and and keep in contact with her friends and family with social media
The Tap is portable, has excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money.
Just a great product and the price is very competable
Good purchase, suits our needs at a reasonable price.
Got this on black Friday for 35 bucks for my 2 year old for youtube viewing, for my 2 year old it's amazing does the job decent battery.It's not that fast or the screen ain't that great but for 35 bucks you get what you pay forI think it's great for kids if you need to do serious stuff on tablet and thinking you can get away with it with this tablet definitely do not buy it
This is good tablet for price of $49.99. The camera is not really bad. One reason why i dont't like Amazon tablet and cellpone is you can't download some apps like magic jack and chikka apps. I like this 2 apps because im using it international.
Great ereader! Easy on the eyes and the battery life last whole week. Enough said
I really enjoy amazon fire tv I get to watch Netflix, amazon prime movies and games. It has a very affordable price for a small box.
This is my first e-reader and i am very happy. It is easy to read and loading books is a breeze. Highly recommended.
If you are going to be using this allot I recommend the Fire TV over the Stick, it is much more responsive. The fire stick tends to be a bit laggy when navigating and launching apps.
I go to hotels frequently and do not like satellite tv or their limited channel selection. This small device connects easily to the wifi and all flat-screen TVs I have found. Life saver on a 2 week training event.
Very great purchase. She gives the weather and sports
This box puts Roku and any other app box to shame!
Have a Smarthings hub which with Amazon Echo has become the best of two worlds.
Need more operational info. Would appreciate your help
This is a good product for the price easy for kids to use
This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
Paperwite is easy to hold, as I have weak wrists. Light weight and so easy to turn pages. Books download in seconds. With the light it is great to be able to read anywhere. Very small so it fits in my purse or a large pocket. I thought it would be hard to read because of it`s size but you can enlarge the letters to suit yourself. Enjoy the compatibility of this little jewel. It`s Great, don't hasatate to buy yours as you will be very pleased.
I like the fire tablet. It is great for checking emails, playing games, etc. Without the expensive cost.
This tablet works perfectly for my eight old. She loves it.
outclasses other tablets at this price point, only downside is the need to use the Amazon App Store instead of the normal Google Play Store. Great tablet for the kids though.
Easy to use and get started with. Have had no issues at all and would recommend.
Love being able to walk in from work and ask Alexa to play whatever music I'm in the mood for. Get up in the morning and have the news read to me as I get ready for the day.
The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors.
Works as any other kindle fire. Does have advertisements, but for $49, can't beat the price.
This reader is purely for the person that simply wants an e-book reader, and very little else.
This is honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made
I like how the software blocks sites from opening if they are malicious sites.
This is a good alternative for those who don't like the chromecast. Not great for plex but regular streaming and navigation are very good.
Was on the fence since I didn't have any other smart products, but glad I took the plunge. Not having an amazon music account only limits what you can have Alexa play, but between the apps and directly connecting to phones, you really don't need it.
I love my Amazon fire tv!! Use it with Playstation Vue, perfect device to cut the cord!!
I love my Fire and the fact that I now have a place for my "library" that's not taking up space on my phone.
Large display makes it easy to use. Very easy to use.
This device is great for any streaming needs, with a quad core mobile processor and 2 gb of ram this device has no problems handling any of your digital needs. Not to mention the AC wireless receiver and option to plug in usb devices and sd cards. I would highly recommend this device for anyone
Happy to have purchased this one for my birthday and this is the best
fast- jitter free, buffering a minimal amount of time with a 100/100 network
I love how easy it is to use and setup the Echo you just plug it in and you are ready to go.
I used a friend's older Kindle and liked it. Wish this one had the side buttons for changing pages. Got this version because it has the light. I read at night when I can't sleep and the light is bright enough so that I don't have to turn on the bright overhead light.Battery life is nice. Was a pleasure taking it on a trip cross country with out having the weight of the books to shelp.
Great product for great price. As described.pleased with purchase
I really like the echo alexa. I started the digital age in my home. Little by little but it all started with alexa. I still have a long way to go. But it has been a fun journey to take. Now i can control my lights,tv,doors, music around my home. My 2 year old daughter would speak with alexa and say. "Alexa, let it go" the frozen song will come up.
This is a great tablet! It has lots of features. The cost is really low for such a great tablet.
I love our Echo! It keeps getting better every day because Amazon keeps making it better, without fees.
Good product to kids for playing games.sssssssssss
The Echo was easy to set up and works wonderfully in the bedroom. So far I've only used it to play music and check the weather. I'm looking forward to exploring all of Alexa's capabilities.
Had the Roku before this and had a big problem with it buffering all the time. This one works much better.
Easy to carry; easy to read. Easy to get books and download. Nice to have a dictionary within your book. Able to download books, newspapers or magazines.
This thing is great, turns my lights on and off, tells me stock market details and even tells me jokes. Couldn't live without it.
Bought as a gift ... Great high quality tablet for the money.
My wife saw the Echo at a friend's house and could not stop talking about it. It's a neat device especially if you are an Amazon Prime member and can link your music files. The kids have fun asking questions or finding out the weather each morning but it's use seems pretty limited to me other than being a fun product.
MY KIDS HAD MONEY AND BOUGHT THEM FOR $33 ON SALE BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND THEY LOVE THEM. THEY ARE GREAT AND FAST TABLETS
Love this device. No glare, lightweight, and portable. Make sure to get a case, the outside bezel tends to scratch rather easily.
Love Alexa! She is very informative and works my lights and plays my favorite music!! I highly recommend this to everyone!
The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone
Love my new Kindle! Only had to login, and all my books were there from older Kindle...Excellant Purchase!!
Quick starting and easy to use. This tablet is great for travel and games at night. E-mail checks are a snap. Low cost makes it something you do not need to worry about. Even supports e print to my HP printer. Buy 2 and enjoy it. No downside found yet.
My wife left her Kindle on the plane. We made a quick stop to Best Buy to purchase her another Kindle. She can't live without it!
My Mom has short term memory loss and I thought this may assist her. The most important ability that we need from the Echo is to easily put things into calendars,reminders, or timers and then easily retrieve them.I think there was an update for that ability. I haven't had much time to set it up yet. With what we have done with it,-Sounds good, plays music,gives directions, good dictionary.Will do more and update this review. I really hope that it can help my Mom! Thanks,Sidney Michelle
I am enjoying using the new and growing features of Alexa. I wish that it wouldn't suddenly turn on for no reason (even in a quiet room). It seems like it's monitoring me. Uncomfortable.
Alexa has become a member of the family. She wakes us up in the morning, helps with math homework, plays music, and keeps track of our shopping lists! I can't imagine not having this device and the Dots in every room!
I like to read and the kindle is great. It's easy to carry with you. You can buy affordable books. I also like the fact you can access the internet.
Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.
Bought two for grandkids so they might read more and it has worked. They enjoy carrying them when traveling also, takings books wherever they go
We have only had our fire stick for a few weeks but we love it so far! There's so many options and the quality is wonderful.
great product to use , easy to setup and use.. with all amazon options
I love the fact that I can play my favorite music and ask anything from silly questions to definitions of things
Easy to use. Great user interface and easy to set up
Very pleasing to eyes to read. Owned the previous paper white and this one has a better DPI (resolution). Got a great deal.
This is a great tablet. It's user friendly and has some great features. Great buy.
Great add on to any home. Alexia is nice to answer questions, play your music, or about anything you can think of.
I absolutely love the versatility of the Echo. Make calls, play music, traffic reports, the skills are great. We have a couple Dots in other rooms so we don't have to yell throughout the house to tell the kids it's time for dinner, just use the "drop in" feature.
Did not have a USB at home that worked with this kindle. This was a must have.
its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader.
We have dropped it a few times and the case is great. There is a ton of memory, great price. And how did I never know about Amazon underground. It's a great product and great price. I definitely recommend
I just want a small tablet to check news, weather etc from time to time, and this product works well for that purpose. It is not as fast on my iPad2 but it is a good choice considering the price.
I bought this onblack friday for $35 AND ABSOLUTELY love it. Thanks Best Buy
This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
She loves her kindle and reads it every night. I am Looking forward to seeing her face when she opens this in a couple weeks - better screen and WiFi that works. The old one lost WiFi connection in an update or something but works with USB, its about 4 years old. Even with those issues she loves the old one. So this one is going to be spectacularly awesome and the new screen and features are gonna be so appreciated....
It is a kindle, and should be used as one - for reading. Other functions are a plus.
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
Great product great price great service. Can't asked for anything better.
Great e reader. Preffered the brighter display of the voyage over the paperwhite. Happy with 3G connection for all time access.
The amazon tablet is priced amazingly. However, the tablet needs to be restarted constantly to find a WiFi connection.
Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it.
Great if you like reading at night. Backlight works great.
This product is totally worth buying. It's perfect for someone who likes to play games or read.
I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.
Great tablet great screen built well responds well
I really like the Paperwhite, it made me want to read books on my Kindle again. Try it if you hate it, return it, but get your hands on this for a while, and I'm convinced you will keep it.
Purchased as a gift for daughter and she hasn't put it down yet.This is now her go to device over her laptop,MP3 player or phone. To me that speaks volumes!
I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my wife. I have always loved the Kindle products. This is her first Paperwhite and we are incredibly pleased with it. Very lightweight, the touchscreen aspect doesn't get in the way of things, and the backlight doesn't compromise the e-ink quality of feeling like reading on paper.
First off I would say Best Buy is where I get all my electronics. Nothing like touching and testing something before you buy. This is a great little device. If you catch it on sale and you can afford. Get one. You won't regret it.
I bought one of these tablets for my 5 year old son and he loves it. Very user friendly and many options of games and apps for free at Amazon.
This is great for when you link your accounts and ask Alex to play them for you, however her AI and speech recognition still need some improvement. Pairing your mobile devices to the echo is great as well for all those services not yet supported by Amazon.
I bought this for my parents. It is easy to operate.
If your not sure of what your needs are..The Fire is a good place to start..
Our technology and innovation are great and this device is a great tool to make life easier.
I bought this tablet to read Free Epub books that I have, but it didn't allow me to even look for the books, so I have it returned and exchanged for a cheaper one that still does a better job for those who wants to read free Epub books
This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.
purchased this item for my 7 year grandson he loves it
Perfect device for my kids. Easy to use with lots of features.
Purchased this as a Christmas present for my wife and she loves it! Mostly plays music on it now, but I'm sure its usage will expand as time goes by.
I bought this for travel so I can read as much as I can without bartering and carrying books. It's easy to read but the size doesn't work for me. I have to hold it with two hands. I was hoping I could hold it in one. In retrospect I would get the Amazon Fire instead.
The Voyage is worth the extra money. It's a wonderful device. Very responsive and easy to use. I would highly recommend!
Got this for half-price as a Deal of the Day! Love it!
Does everything I expected. Plus things I didn't know it could do.
Good reader and great for streaming apps. Kid friendly too
In trying to get my son to read more and thought a kindle would help. First I got a good deal on an old kindle model that had been refurbished and it quickly broke. I had a gift card to Best Buy and this one was on sale, so I got it for him. I also bought him a silicone case and bought a Best Buy warranty. It is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and I like that you can use FreeTime app on this device but you only just get the books. I also use overdrive to get him books from the library. So far it is working great for us. I bought this at Best Buy instead of getting it online from Amazon because I like the Best Buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than Amazon.
I like to play games and check e-mail and the cost was great
I absolutely love my firestick. The possibilities are limitless.
This is really the best streaming device it has all the services like netflix, hulu, and it also plays games. I love this fire tv. Its also 4k.
Bought for my nieces, great for them and easy to learn to use
We use them for classes, they work great and are easy to use for our older individuals
Hours of battery life and easy to work. Great gift
We use this speaker all the time. It's perfect. I would buy this time and time again.
The free Geek Squad virus protection does not work and the apps you can download are limited.
Great notepad! Huge screen and easily downloaded apps to use. Love it!
We have a smoke glass case so this works excellent for us.
We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time!
Amazon is always producing great products for a affordable price.
New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market), battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. Recommend it for all.
I use this as a large mp3 player. you can buy a memory card to expand this unit. i put in 128gb card and have put 1000's of songs and still have not use up all the memory unlike my Ipad that fills up fast and has no way of expanding the memory.
Bought Alexa for my father in law for Christmas in which he loved!
Very simple design which makes it very easy for me to navigate through any screen.
My eyes are unaffected by the paperwhite and it truly feels like reading a real book. Love ability to download a new one on the fly and to highlight and get it all sent to my email after! Very impressed
Great for price. Wish the Amazon App store had more apps. Overall good especially for prices.
I love it it is just awesome all the things you can do
Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
I love the kindle. we purchased 3 of them. they are great for the little things that you don't want to pull your laptop out for and good for the bigger things that you need to view on something bigger than your phone. The apps are good and games are fun.
Amazon Fire Tablet: Catch up on your reading or browse the Web with this tablet, which offers access to Amazon Underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. Front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments or chat with friends.
This is a wonderful product that can be used by everyone
Great for my 6 year old son he loves it was an easy set up. and for my son being 6 he knows how to work it very well. great from kids.
I was looking for something within reasoning and saw the ad for these. I purchased them for my two oldest grand-babies and they loved them. I not only enjoy the price that I paid for them, but I can honestly say that my grand-babies are to this day still enjoying them.
I brought Fire HD8 for my Daughter, She have been used it since Christmas.
Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase.
I went back and forth for quite some time about purchasing the Echo. I watched many YouTube videos and reviews as well as reading a lot about the product itself. I finally caught it on sale and used to gift cards to buy it despite protests from my wife. I have to say Alexa is pretty intuitive and has no issues recognizing my voice. There are times when you have to word a sentence specifically but that is just a minor annoyance. Amazon has done a great job updating the Echo weekly and adding relevant skills such as package tracking and even flight status. I use it mostly for news, weather, shopping lists, reminders, movie times, timers, and occasionally some music. If you have any smart appliances then controlling them with Alexa is really cool. I only have a smart plug right now but it is great to walk in to a dark room and just ask Alexa to turn the light on or when you are about to go to bed and do not want to walk in the dark, just ask Alexa to turn the light off once u are there. As long as it is a reasonable distance of course. I admit it is a bit pricey so one should really look at their possible uses because I could see the novelty wearing off for some but for me it is a keeper.
This e reader is easy on the eyes, light weight, has an adjustable back light, and has a decent storage size. It only does black and white so be aware of that if you have books with pictures or images.
I brought this for my 3YR OLD and she loves it. It'd very easy for her to use.
It started cutting off and on by itself!!! Its like it had a mind of its own!!!
Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.
Love my new device! Great value for the money. Worth it.
I ended up returning it, but it's nothing really wrong with the device itself. Despite the low specs, it was mostly responsive and pretty snappy, though I've owned better. I'm just not super invested in the Amazon ecosystem, so I was missing things that other tablets have access to, like Nook/Kobo stores, Microsoft Office, and the like. Good choice for a kid's tablet just because it's small and you won't cry much if you lose or break it.
My Kindle is great for reading books. It's less useful for use on reference material where I'm frequently moving from one part of the work to another.
I purchased one of these for myself back in January, and when my mother remarked on it, I knew she wanted one as well. It works great for both myself and her, despite the differences in our reading habits and hand sizes.
Works great. I bought this for my 7 year old after she broke her other kindle. It works just as good as her Kindle fire HD but it was way cheaper. There's not a lot of storage but for $50 I won't complain.
Easy to set up. Durable for toddlers. Highly recommend.
Great addition to the family room. Easy to set up and use.
I have both Fire tv and the Fire Stick. The Fire TV can connect via cable to internet andcis definitely faster than the Stick. Also had more storage. If you don't need to connect wirelessly and don't mind the extra $$ get the Fire TV
Replaced an older model that was having charger issues.
I Love it! It is easy for anyone to use. Easy to transport, too.
My first tablet! I was surprised it's just like my Samsung phone, and actually can sync programs and data with it. The wireless is great; I have no need for cell capabilities. It would be more power usage to search for cell, and most places I can use wi-fi. I use it as an alternative Kindle reader with the Kindle app. I also was amazed to find a free Microsoft Office Word, Powerpoint, and Excel, etc, although I haven't used them. This Tab A is sometimes kind of slow, but it was about $100 on sale, and great for the price. Very versatile. I'm very happy with it. I haven't needed extra memory yet, but good to know I can expand it with a microSD card.
Very power full box, great for streaming 4K look beautiful.
This is a good all around tablet for a nice price. I have one for me and one for my seven year old and haven't regretted it. I suggest it if you have Prime and love tech.Only con is the cameras which are a bit grainy but I use a phone for pics
Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started
easy setup and works flawlessly but always wants you to purchase Amazon products
I'm thinking this must of been a fluke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund
A nice tablet for the price. No a-lot of meaningful competition at this price range, which makes the Fire tablet an easy selection for the price conscious buyer.
Kids love playing games on the tablet - fast for an inexpensive tablet.
Love the sound quality and ease of use and setup. It's very informative and helpful
The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine.
it works great and this is my second one since I lost the old one anyway
Great for my dad, who has trouble with smaller print. He has had no problems setting it up and getting started.
This makes automation and. W built on speaker easier !!! Very good for hooking up to the HUE light system to help automate things. tech has come a loooong way !
purchased for Kodi and 1st time setup was little bit time taking process. after that everything good.. getting 4k resolution and flexible to carry anywhere.. buffering is good when you connected through internet cable instead of wifi
This tablet had been great. So much better than the old tablet we had.
I was hesitant in buying one of these but I took the risk and the risk paid off. It's an amazing piece of hardware in a little box, not to mention a stylish box. If your looking for a streaming box? Look no further!
was able to replace with new, with my warranty. This is is little better than the first one
This is the best kindle yet. Love the features and soft back-lighting.
This product is well worth the price... don't waste money on a screen protector or case... when it gets beat up get a new for another $50.Great for kids who want to play games on theIr parents wireless telephone...nice to get my telephone back. Also slips nicely in the seat pocket of cars for the car rides.
I'm mostly happy, but like so many electronics, this one has a huge of built in advertising that you just can't get away from. There is no way to identify the aps you want to see first, and it always defaults the first click to an advertised movie for sell. It takes many clicks to get where I want, and the voice only works for purchases from Amazon, everywhere else you have to use the keyboard using clicks.
Bought for friend so could have face time with grandbaby.
I'm glad I chose the kindle with lighting. I use it often in bed. No regrets here.
So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
My kids love their kindle. Its the perfect tablet for adults and kids to share.
Ebooks, audible and email, what else do you need? Great tablet!
a good plug
He was amazed that he can serf the web, go onto face book, place amazon orders. Read books so quickly.Play games and likes the front and back cameras.
Third Kinlde and my favorite as I can easily read in sunny conditions. Light weight, more compacy and battery life seems excellent.
It's good for lil kids n small stuff . Doesn't look very fast
The paperwhite is very similar to a real book. The light setting is helpful and eyes friendly. One battery charge can last long.
I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren. They are young and do not need anything fancy. So, knowing these tablets are simple and easy to use for young children was the right one to purchase. They are very happy with the tablets and it is easy for them to understand and use. Excellent purchase.
Still learning, but seems like a good tablet; less $ than an iPad. We will see about the apps.
This tablet works really well, but the pictures, etc. appear a little small but overall this is a good table. It does what I need and I got it at a great price!
Works Great! Love the screen sharpness. Very easy to use.
Bought for Grandchildren, they loved it. We downloaded videos from vacation for them.
Nothing bad to say about the Kindle. I knew what I was getting when I got it, and it hasn't disappointed.
Light weight, charge lasts for upto a week and can read pretty much anytime of the day indoor or outdoor ... very happy to have this e-reader
Kids love it and well integrated with Harmony remote
I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!
I bought 2 of these for my 5-year-old nieces for Christmas. They both travel frequently and the Fire provides hours of entertainment. There is a ton of child-appropriate content available to download. The Fire is a great alternative to a pricier tablet.
Super easy to read in any light! So easy to download books!
Great Christmas presents. Bought 8. Made my nieces, nephews and grandkids- ages two to twenty-very happy. Nice size and convenient.
The new version has 300ppi, which is the same as the voyage. There is no reason to pay for extra $80 just for the page press.
excellent new piece of technology. if done again, i would have just bought the DOT(without the speaker). then bought a decent speaker and aux jacked it. speaker not worth $125 more. but its pretty awesome.
Tablet has good response time and multi tasking is seamless as well! Good vivid colors!
Bought this for my wife for Christmas after reading the reviews. Hands down the best e-reader for the price.
Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick.
Wow factor only limited by your inquisitive mind love it
My previous kindle's home page was more intuitive than the Paperwhite I just bought
Again after some time I just use it for music like the google one I started out with but was unhappy. I wish it looked better since it's pretty ugly. Also the lights are on the top so unless your standing next to it your not sure it's actually hearing you speak which can be frustrating from across the room needing to repeat your self over and over. It it's better at answering random questions then google.
Great tablet for kids I would buy more if I needed to
Great device. Works well. Very handy. Got it as a gift for my father. Own one as well.
The Fire 7 has a great price! You get your money's worth. However, you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one. The one I bought had a busted pixel in the screen. There was no damage to the case or glass screen, but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screen's image. I've owned multiple, but I have never had this problem before with an ePad tablet when I just bought it. I will now have to visit Best Buy again tomorrow for an exchange. I'm hoping they're still in stock. It's not Best Buy's fault. The fault lies with Amazon. They're clearly not that durable.
Bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it
Everything was great. The actual item is holding up to our little ones expectations as well as mine ! This is definitely something that we would encourage everyone else to purchase as well. It's pretty fast and simple!
This is my second one. The first one I bought for my daughter for her birthday. Once I saw how it worked I needed one for myself. Still trying to get used to it but I really like it.
The best product to come out of Amazon. Just love my Echo, works well as smart hub
Great price for a tablet. Like the size and looks.
amazon kindle fire 7 inch is a super buy . works great .
The only bad thing I can say about this tablet is that after using certain apps you have to turn the tablet completely off in order to get to the main screen.
This is an awesome tablet, great price, lots of memory, fast processor
I think this is a good tablet. I will order more. It loads the games quickly.
This is the first tab my niece is using and she is just loving it
I'm pleased with the Amazon Fire. It puts web browsing and a reader in a device that will fit in my purse. As a Black Friday special the price was almost 'too good to be true'.
My kids love these. They are easy to use and no glitches!!
User friendly with so many more features than my older kindle. Love all the color choices and now I can read in the dark next to my sleeping husband!
This was the perfect gift for grandkids. I bought one in pink and one in green so each grandchild would have their own color. Lots of games come with the tablet and additional games and videos can be added.
Price for the device was a great deal and the assistance provided by employees was great.
This is a must buy!!!! Great picture you will enjoy this product
After reading scores of reviews on multiple types of units, this Amazon Fire TV was the choice for me. VERY happy with my purchase!
Didn't compare to the fire stick, unknown if better product, but love amazons creation
Bought it on sale, great for reading Kindle books, but is rather slow. Still a good buy for a really cheap tablet.
I had wanted a Fire for about 3 Years but didn't pick one up but this time I did. Wasn't what I thought it would be like.
it works better than the other product that I have
Great tablet for kids and adult, it had parental control as well as amazon apps
I bought this for my 2 yr old. (For his first experience with plane rides and airport waiting) it was very helpful in keeping him quiet and occupied. It can be a bit slow depending on your wifi connection but not problem enough for me to dislike it.
Bought this for my daughter after she broke my Gen1 Nexus 7. Great little table for doing simple things, perfect for kids.
good and helpfull i like it get it its good my kids love it
Love the amazon fire. I definitely recommend this product
Even after reading the reviews about it being slow I decided to go head any purchase it. Didn't thick it was going to be this slow
Great price for tablet. My college son purchased these with his money to donate to city after school program for low income kids. Kids love them and are learning to read more! Tons of educational and fun stuff on Amazon Fire!
We enjoy using the fire tv. Since we are prime members we also get free movies
She was happy about it and can't get enough of this tablet
We've had so much fun with this thing, we just love it!
Bought it for my 4 year old and he loves it! The child case is awesome too in case of any drops.
This is great for a connected home. People who use this should buy it if they plan on making everything in their home wi-if enabled. Otherwise it's an expensive SIRI.
Scratches easily but otherwise good. Cases can also be hard to find.
excellent device, very fast especially when connected to ethernet
The Amazon fire TV has been a nice addition at home. Has everything you need on one device and more. Highly recommend to anyone who streams videos.
This is the best and probably only e-reader that you need. Screen is beautiful and perfect with built-in light. However, I would like one with bigger screen size and hope amazon could improve reading performance on Pdf files.
I bought this tablet for my grandson and he absolutely loves it!!!!!
Very fast and reliable fits easy behind tv upload apps and view video in 4000k
Like to ask questions to Alexa without have to move from my chair. Really like the skills that relate to what I like and what I need.
Very easy to setup and I love the colored screen. Great for reading books or just surfing the web. You will not be disappointed.
Easy setup, fast.Had everything ROKU has plus games.
The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet.
Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money
My husband got this for Father's Day. He loves the ease of downloading his favorite music and books.
Really enjoyed purchasing thus product for little ones
Easy to use and understand. It's a great purchase.
This thing is pretty cool. My nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. Nice job on the heavy duty case. It is a little slow though.
Love the Echo. Alexa is my new favorite gadget. Can't wait to update the house
My son enjoys being on his tablet and getting on all the apps he has. It keeps him entertained. He loves it!
It's a good tablet for the price considering it was only $50. Not the best quality but suitable for my kids to enjoy
Great device for the family. Can play music from various sources. The voice recognition system is great.. You can control smart devices on your network with the echo..
Got this tablet for my daughter and it has been good for her. Size and weight is just right for her small hands. Only draw back is you can only get apps that amazon has developed. Not able to get android apps on it.
I bought this for as a gift for my daughter. she love it!
We really love our new Amazon Tap. My Son enjoys playing with it.
I absolutely love this product. I actually bought two. One for work and one for home!
I love my echo. Just getting use to the many applications it can be use for.
I like how the Amazon Fire TV works consistently. With it being able to be hardwired into my existing network, it fires up and works seamlessly.
This is an amazing product doesn't matter if u buy for a kid or an adult either one will absolutely love it I have 2 !!! Totally recommend it
It's a must buy for the money you can't beat it at all.
I love the Amazon fire tv. I have so much access to television series and movies.
For the price you pay and to do basic functions this table is well worth the money.
Fun to use and also easy for kids to use as well! Good tablet for books and games for all the family!
Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it
I bought this tablet for my step daughter, who asked for a tablet. She threw a fit because she wanted a more expensive tablet. I only returned it because I already have a tablet and didn't need another. I would not have a problem recommending the Amazon Fire Tablet to those looking for an economical tablet for a child
Don't let the summary fool you; the reason this is the third one is because of the quality! I've bought one for myself, one for my son-in-law, and I bought this as a replacement for my mother, who uses it to read books in her tiny apartment. The Kindle Fire is extremely user-friendly, and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an inexpensive but reliable tablet.
Alexa tell me a joke, Alexa play some Christian music
Bought this for my husband. He's been asking for for almost a year. Well it's a great device informative and fun and the music channels are phenomenal. I would highly recommend it.
I USE THE ECHO FOR MUSIC, GAMES, TRIVIA, AND FOR SMART LIGHTING. IT'S AWESOME .
Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!
Product is awesome. I love it it's easy to use and is fast.
This tab is awesome. Easy to handle and carry anywhere because of its size. The price also very reasonable.
Works as advertised.
Easy setup and the Echo voice activated searches is a nice touch. Good set of applications as well.
Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person.
Able to read more and longer than I thought. Light is bright enough, but too bright to bother someone nearby.
The fire does a ton and costs very little. I really like it
Allows my teens to access apps and Internet while still reading on down time between games
This might be the best product that I have ever purchased.
Bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it!
The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
This piece of tech. is amazing and functional. I liked it so much specially in the morning to check weather, news and listen to some music. High qulaity and solid.
I own the Echo, and love the product! So I purchased the Tap as a gift.
the amazon fire sucks the pictures and camera sucks and blurry as can be
Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
This product is very user friendly, easy to use. The remote is clean and simple in design.
The fire tv is a great, reliable product. I have several including the fire stick. I can't say enough good things about them
This is a great product and it runs Android so you can install Kodi.
Was given to my husband as a gift. He loves it. Said it was a great gift. Purchase it at a great price.
My wife loves it she uses it every night to read her romance novels so if my wife's happy I'm happy!!!
This tablet is great not just for adults but also kids. After having this tablet I'll never go back to a different brand.
When back light is off it's just like a paper. Very convenient for reading. For night, back light is so well done that still look natural.
Having so much fun asking Alexa all kinds of questions. She is so smart!
This speaker has great sound and is very easy to use.
Was not sure I would like or use Echo that much, but now that I have installed and using, it is great for questions, notifications and keeping me up to date.
Purchased this for my girlfriend who loves it. Great upgrade, even from the Kindle fire HD
Very good quality and easy to use, you can read anytime!
The fire is a decent pad for basic uses. The only downside is the way the fire automatically links with your Amazon account. Also the ads are annoying and clearly designed to increase your Amazon purchases more than anything else.
The Amazon Echo has become a critical appliance in our kitchen. Admittedly we bought the Echo to serve as yet another cool toy to have around...but we're finding that it's a great addition to our lives.The top used function for our family is probably the simple to use timer function, but a close second is the ability to call on any artist we want to hear with Amazon Prime Music. It's well worth a few bucks a month to get the music service and the sound quality of the device (although not audiophile worthy) is quite good.Our family is still exploring the many great tools available with Alexa...but I can say without reservation that it's a great device to have for any household.
This is a cheap tablet. I bought this so that my kids wouldn't ruin another IPad by crushing it. This tablet can stop working out of nowhere shut off and never turn on again. If it doesn't have a case and you drop it kiss this good bye because even a light drop can destroy it.
I wish ir had all the free aps on Google play store. I am finding I have to pay for alot of the free ones I am use to.
This is a pretty good streaming player, much better than the Roku we have. Only thing I wish this had is the Google Play Store. Other than that it's really good.
It gets time to get used to it and sometimes it misunderstands the commands, but overall it is really awesome and a great experience!!
The Echo does everything it is advertised to do. Mine does things without a hitch that others have a problem with. Mine does lighting through my alarm system in a few simple steps. Works great!
Very satisfied with product as do my family /kids.
This Amazon Fire TV is my second unit in my home. I haven't paid for cable since I bought my first unit a couple years ago. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you should seriously already own one.
Bought for my grandson who is four and he can operate it like a champ
I love what it can do, and how helpful it can be. It is very easy to setup and then it just works. On top of that you can teach it more with skills. All in all this is a great little device!
I'm really enjoying this device. It lets you cut the cable cord.
Very nice product...Had everything we were looking for...
I am very happy with the echo. We use it and listen to it daily
This speaker is a must have! The Amazon Echo has Wonderful sound and can control a lot of electronics! It can tell you jokes and even start your car
I gave this tablet to my 6yr old for Christmas, she is enjoying it very much. I was surprised how good the quality was for the price I would definitely recommend it.
It's a fun little toy but lacks practicality. In order to make it user friendly, I recommend a battery for it. You will also need Amazon prime in order for the music to play worth a darn. Otherwise you will be stuck searching through your phone for your song.
My wife uses this to read various newspapers. There's a problem occasionally with downloading the current issue. It's not a problem every day, just ever once in a while. Pleased with the device.
This is just what I needed - great price - great tablet. I am a Math Teacher and I use this tablet in my classroom to award Class Dojo points and check on progress in Moby Max Math. This was perfect for me.
I love the amazon echo! It has always worked flawlessly for us.
Worked as expected and can use my old docking station
Bought five of these for my teachers to take photos/videos and upload to our site and email parents. Does everything just fine, except the cameras aren't the greatest. Pretty slow to capture the pic and they all come out blurry with he slightest amount of motion (from the subject or photograher). Ok product if your not focused on taking pictures.
Lots of options. If you are a prime member, you have a great selection of movies.
I purchased three tablets and the grand children have been using them every day and they are working great and just the one that they needed. They are easy for them to use and even this grandmother can work them and that is a plus for us.
Love my kindle paperwhite! Take it everywhere! Light enough to hold or carry, fits in most purses. Can read outside in bright sunlight, has built in adjustable backlight for reading in bed & not disturbing yourbedmate. Lots of storage & battery life is excellent. Highly recommend for purchase if you are looking for a black & white reader only!
After long review decided to buy the Fire Tablet as a gift for a great frienday. She loves it! It's the perfect size and has all the features she was looking for in a tablet. Happy Birthday!
This paperwhite is great for reading anywhere ! Outside, at night ! It small lightweight and i just love it !
While Alexa doesn't know all the answers to our questions she is surprisingly smart and is getting smarter. We haven't tapped into all her features yet choosing to savor each new discovery. We are very pleased and having a great time with our new family member.
The fire tv is worth every penny. I have not had any issues with my device
This is a smooth product. works very well; still have the iPad over it but for the price you can't beat it .
My dear wife is a voracious reader and Paperwhite by Kindle is her reader of choice. She absolutely loves everything about it.We also recently became Prime members, and she is hoping there will be some great books to read at no additional charge!
Good gift for basic Internet use browsing emails .
Love the size for reading and also for playing games online. Tablet is fast to respond.
tried fire stick first ,to slow for me so i exchanged it for this fire tv .. i like it much better
I love this product! My home automation is wonderful to be controlled by voice.
Changed the print size to huge - which it is not!!!. Would appreciate the larger print size for reading books
It works great. If you have a chance to get one I would recommend it.
Easy to use as it is intuitive. Love the Alexa remote. You can just say "Alexa Tom Hanks"and it will pull up all the Tim Hanks movies available.
I have two fire tv boxes and they work great. I pluged my direct into the router with a patch cable for very fast speed. The wifi is also very strong and works great. Love the optional storage slot for a flash card.
I have to repeat myself when alexa is at volume 8-10 at a short distance.
The Amazon Fire TV Box with 4K streaming works very well.
Got this for my mother in law for Christmas as one of her presents and she loves it!
I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say "watch CNN on PlayStation Vue". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets. Awesome if you want to listen you a show in bed without disturbing others.
Love the tablet, my 4 year old uses the tablet on a daily basis! Perfect tablet for kids!
Best streaming device on the market today. Amazon is a good company.
This is the 3rd tablet that we have purchased and at $50 you can't go wrong. Great for the kids to watch Netflix in the car. The only issue or flaw is the charging input always is the first to go.
This was the perfect gift for my Neice and nephew I bought two
Love it! It allows me to charge it without having to plug it to a computer.
This is so much better than the Kindle that I purchased 3 years ago. It is much faster, and I really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged.
I'll admit that I sometimes think of this as the computer on "Star Trek" but I appreciate the wit of some of the responses. Like when I asked, "Alexa, did you miss me?"
Love being able to listen to radio stations or music
This is a great device to have and use. I have two
I bought this for my Mom. She is 83 yrs old. She wanted it to put the Bible on it. She loves it's!
I am glad that I bought the kindle paperwhite for my daughter. It is easy to use and is perfect for reading anywhere!!!
Better then a E-book, more options and versatility
Great little tablet for my young family member and the price is right.
I sometimes find the store a little intimidating, and certainly overwhelming. I don't always know what I want beforehand. My existing Surface failed in far to short a time frame, and since I really only used it to read I was able to replace its functions with a kindle fire, and I am actually much happier with it.
Works faster than the Blu ray Dvd/streaming combo like Sony or Samsung those were very slow streaming devices. I'm only on 3MBPS & the amazon Fire is a solid steaming device. I use Amazon video, Netflix, Pureflix,YouTube I've also seen a live event that streamed really good. Very impressed compared to the blu ray combo but it has its place but not for streaming anymore. Well done amazon and thanks to Best Buy .
I appreciate the small size, clarity of text, and long battery life if the WiFi is turned off.
This tablet is not even and introduction to tablets, it is a full tablet. It does not have mobile access but you can do everything through wifi. Once you download items they become available to you offline. You can even add a 128 Gb memory card so you never run out of offline things to enjoy.The family sharing feature is excellent, particularly the one that allows you to created children profile. Your kids are protected and learn and play based on your criteria.
Alexa makes this worth it. AI is intelligent and does get smarter as you talk to it. She has some jokes too. This works even better with a Prime membership. I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't fond of the tube. I can see myself knocking it down. The sound wasn't full or rich enough for me compared to Bose.
I wasn't offer the warranty, but I enjoy it a lot.
Bought for grandkids learning to read. Have found lots of kids books. They love them
Currently enjoying the learning experience. We have not dived whole-heartedly into the many channel options
Got as a gift for my wife and she loves it. Easy to read in dim lit room plus the battery life on it is amazing
If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!
I really get the most of my Amazon Prime Video now. I find it is easy and responsive to use. The main pain is having to change the Input so you have to use three controllers, the media controller, the cable controller and the original TV controller. Fortunately I'm used to that with my Apple TV. It is less fussy than the Apple TV especially when you view Amazon content. Well it naturally would be because the content is automatically there.
Bought 3 of these tablets for our household. Everyone really likes the size of this tablet.
Pick the fire tv over the Apple and we are glad we did. We didn't even realize how many free apps and shows you can watch without being a prime member. Great buy, I wish we had bought one a lot sooner and dropped cable.
Bought this as a present for our son, turns out to be a great present for the family. Very easy to use and as advertised.
had a problem with my purchase, but Best Buy made it good, they are very good!
This tablet was purchased for a present. It is the second one that I have purchased.
I have always been a Nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. So, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. The biggest influence behind price. While the new Samsung model of the Nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. Overall, we are very happy with this purchase. It is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. Kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader.
Takes to many requests for Alexa to understand what you want. Have to ask several different ways to get most radio stations. When you ask for Rush Limbaugh, you get country music stations. Alexa must be sending me a message.
I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
The Fire TV is an impressive device. There are tons of apps available and enough content for everyone. I recently cut the cord with Comcast and mostly view Prime content, which loads and plays quickly. The remote is super easy to use too. Great product and great value.
Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken.
Amazing Sound! All around great product! Nothing negative so far.
I love this product! The price is great for such a deal.
Easy to setup and connect. Works well with various apps
Good device4k video is niceGreat supportNegative point is doesn't have Browser and cach issue low space.
Great sound, almost perfect interactions and portable. I have the dot and now the tap. The new update allowing voice activation is awesome. Great toy!
great device...a lot of learning to do. we hsve a lot more of exploring to do with Alexa
Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!
Speaker is much better than the smaller one but can be connected to other speakers as well. Easy to do literally everything via voice.
Fire TV was just about equal to the nexus player. and it it more expensive
I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
Would be 5 star if it had the capability of being a wireless speaker as well
I have been missing out on reading books. This kindle is perfect. My wonderful husband gave this to me for my birthday. What a wonderful surprise.
Bought this for my wife for Xmas. Also bought 3 more for each of my kids. Great interface, easy to use. Suggest buying a memory card as well for storage of all the apps.
I like this tablet a lot. I now own 3 of them and feel good that I can have one close to the tv. If I step on it and crush it I am only out a few bucks. It is clearly not as nice as my ipad, but I can get 10 of these for what one I device costs. I use it to watch tv, read, and surf the web. As a sports fan, sometimes I line all three up so I can watch three games at once.
Device is very responsive upon command. Easy to setup and is a companion when no one is in the room
Great products. Haven't used the shoulder bag much. I don't travel much. Nice to have just in case.
I've been a Kindle user since the very first one came out to the market and I always wanted to be able to use touch to communicate with the device. This Kindle allows me to do just that.
I own several iPads but wanted to try one of these as I am an Amazon Prime member. These are a STEAL and what a value. The fact that you can insert a micro SD card to expand storage is a huge plus and I have been very pleased with the availability of APPs. I will be taking my this to Europe and have been able to download a bunch of movies for the trip from my Amazon Prime membership. I purchased at Best Buy with a gift card and now use it more than my iPad.
Got this product for a relative for christmas who had a kindle fire and was looking for an upgrade. With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire. This product was not only lighter on her thumbs but also worked great in any light.
It has a bunch of cool features that other similar wireless speakers do not have.
It work very well my nephew love it this is the second one is brought
Got this tablet for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it, it is hard to beat for the price.
I purchased as a gift for a five year old, and he loves it. He has downloaded several educational games, and he loves it. Very easy to use, and has a great battery life. The price is great, and the tablet is great for the amount you pay.
the tablet was a great gift and my kids loved it best buy online is great
My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .
the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.
I would recommend the Kindle Paper White to anyone.
Having a charger for my Kindle Paperwhite makes certain that I am charging the Kindle with the proper charging power.
I bought a fire stick for a friend and then followed it up with the bigger one for myself. Extremely happy
Really good tablet for the priceI can't complain ...
Slim fit in my purse, love the page turn "buttons". Auto light adjusting is good!
The Kindle Paperwhite is user friendly, light and easy to hold. I would highly recommend this electronic reader to anyone.
The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet.
Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
This works great for voice control of my Samsung Smartthings for home automation.
Love the no glare feature. Perfect for outdoors. This is light weight and will be great for travel.
good tablet for day to day use. Not for those who want HD everything but shows decent video in SD.
Very good product and easy to set up. I've used it everyday and enjoy it!
I love how easy it is to use and the variety you get.
Got this for my 7 year old because of the parental controls I heard about. So far it's been a decent tablet and has some nice controls, but it would be better if the controls could be customized by day and specific apps instead of all apps and by weekday/weekend.
Up until now I had been using different android boxes to stream movies.I had read that the Fire Tv is very quick and capable of 4k, which is better than the expensive apple tv. Super easy to set up and boots lightening fast. Easy to sideload apps such as Kodi. I bought one for myself and another for my daughter. We all love it. The remote control is very responsive and voice search is awesome.
I paired this with the logitech elite universal remote and my amazon prime account and it make entertaining guest slot easier.
I bought this for my dad and he absolutely loves it!!
This product is wonderful! We use it for shopping lists, music, and general info! We sit around the dinner table wondering about something and we just ask her! Its also great for timers and measuring! LOVE IT!
Great tablet, perfect size, has night mode on display so you would be able to fall asleep if using at night - won't keep you awake because blue light is filtered out. Response is great, colors IPS panel great, no blue tooth
I'm a computer geek so I excited when my Wife go me a tablet for Christmas. I enjoy playing games, reading books/magazines, and like the small compact size with power.
Great very easy to use clear picture my 4 yr old grandson is happy
I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.
Very nice tablet and great for kids and being able to set timeverything limits for children's profiles. My only this is a little different to locate and find apps for downloading without amazon.
So far, I am loving this tablet. Of coarse, it will take some time to fully learn all the good and bad aspects of this tablet. The screen is a little smaller than I thought. It has great apps. It's quick and smooth. Even sent me an email when I downloaded a free app. It offers a lot more options than the ipad that I've had for awhile. Looks like the ipad is on the way out.
This is my 2nd unit. I liked the first one that my son gifted me so much, I got this second unit for the downstairs. The fact that it was 50% off form BestBuy didn't hurt either.
Good sound quality and a nice selection of skills that it can learn including radio shows
The Paperwhite is a terrific e-reader. The text is clear, the backlighting easy on the highs, and if course has a huge selection of books.
I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.
Glad I was given this as a present. I can listen to music just by asking... Love this!!!
Hoping to replace cable TV in the near future. Works great.
Tablet compares to my Samsung tablet that I paid over $250 for.
We love it no need for cable! Just make sure you have really good internet!
This is a great tablet, if you keep your expectations in check. Is it going to rival the likes of the iPad or even the 2013 Nexus 7? No. But there is a lot of junk in the $50-100 tablet market. Thankfully the new Kindle Fire isn't one of these. The screen quality is adequate for reading and watching youtube, netflix, and hulu. I had multiple apps open and it didn't feel too bogged down. If you can find it when it is on sale for $39.99, it's an even bigger steal.
I am very happy with my echo. I use it to play music while I workout and clean. It's also very help when I'm trying to put my 15 month to sleep. You can do some much without touching it. Love it
This is a smart buy! Wonderful for reading and watching movies. Perfect if you have Amazon Prime!
My son received this last year for Christmas. He loves it!
I bought for my wife cause she couldnt see apps on her phone. This works great, now if i could just keep her from shopping
We are really happy we purchased our "Echo", we really enjoy simply asking Alexa questions, and the music selection is great. We simply say Alexa, play a Dean Martin song, and here it comes, if it is something we really like we simply say Alexa, a little louder. It is a lot of fun with a small investment, and Best Buy is the place to purchase.
Small, easy to read, great battery life. Lasts for days. Go buy this.
I have had an Echo for over a year and bought two for my son's. In my experience it is a joy to use. The voice recognition tech is astounding. It is really easy to use.
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.We set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. We downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. It also works great with our Amazon Fire TV and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. This is a great buy for the money and I recommend it to everyone.
Alexa is great, the Amazing Echo is amazing! Great purchase.
The product worked as expected. has a nice sleek design and does not take up much space
My grandson loves his. He uses it mainly for social media like Instagram and ovoo.
Bought for 11 yr old Grandson. The look on his face made the money more than worth it. Kindle makes good products & I've been a long time Best Buy customer. never had a complaint.
Easy to use, very durable, kid mode extra safe, password needed for purchases and parental mode. All in all a wonderful tablet to own.
Bought a couple of these for my kids. They love being able to watch videos and play games on their own tablets.
Great price for this easy to use tablet for younger kids! Easy to get it going.
The light and white page allows me to read in bed without disturbing my spouse.
This is a great value for the money. With Amazon's apps for kids it has been alot of fun and easy to use.
Right Price, Works, Great, Best Buy has a great selection
It's all the great features of the Fire but with added bonuses for the kids. The app for the kids is great and the case has held up to our two year old thus far.
My daughter has been enjoying it since her birthday
The tablet was cheap and a great deal. The kids love it. It is very nice because it has a kids mode and a separate parent mode.
Great little streamer. Little to no buffering for amazon prime. Easy to load Kodi for expanded fealtures.
Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
Upgraded from first generation kindle. Works better than expected
Got this for a friend as a birthday gift. He seen one that we had an fell in love.
We are really pleased with this tablet. The color is great.
Echo came in on time and packaged well. Size is good. Playing music is good. Doesn't always understand what is asked and some things doesn't know or have to find just right way to ask. However, I'm still learning about it and it is still learning. Responds very quickly when it understands what is asked. It is fun so far and I hope will get even better.
Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.
The fire was very easy to set up right out of the box.
Navigating around the tablet can be somewhat confusing at times, but for the price you cannot get a better tablet.
Fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos
After a lot of research, decided to get the Fire for 80 year old mother-in-law. She is gradually learning it and is enjoying using it as a reader. Fairly quick learning curve for someone definitely not technologically inclined.
easy to use and navigate. controller is not complicated.
This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.
when you turn on fire box it opens/runs movies fast.
I love the options that you have with the fire box over other like products.
I like this tablet it's easy to use Easy for the kids
The old Fire TV's had an optical audio out S/PDIF, the new ones only have an HDMI output. Great if you have a new A/V setup that has HDMI pass-through on the receiver, not so good if you want to run video through HDMI and audio to your receiver.I should have probably considered a Roku.
I have used chromecast before; but heard a lot about its voice remote and other benefits. So, purchased this one. It is good; but i loved casting from my browser. It doesn't have default browser or in app store. probably I can install one using adb. Also, it is somehow slower than chromecast and takes a log time once it goes to sleep. I will recomend to someone only of someone knows adb and can add on apps.
I'm so happy to bought it, i will buy two more soon
this is a fun gadget that can make a lazy person even lazier. Love the features
Every morning I ask what the weather is, and she tells me. Fantastic. She also does a lot more.
Many I do not know rather than features to search the web. Nice sound for a speaker
I wanted a simple reader for east of transportability and use. Although I still occasionally use my tablet to read I wanted something more light weight. I haven't tested this in the sunlight but so far I love it's smaller size and simplicity.
No problems with it at al. Worth the money. Would buy again.
I could not find the charger anywhere else and this one worked great
This product is convenient for voice controlling the environment, lighting and relaxing with music or voice calls. I would like to see it have the ability to connect with other echoes to create a surround sound effect or have the ability to add sound to Chromecast.
It is a pretty good tablet for the price. The only thing is when I gave it to my Niece for the holidays that it had debris under the screen in which the backlight amplified their existence.
This is a very food tablet with its price. Very decent and affordable!0
Love the Echo. It is amazing. Does whatever I ask.
I'm writing a review based on the problem I had with my Kindle HD 8.9 it would not hold a charge even though Amazon try to reboot it from their location or had to technician try to reboot it but it wouldn't come on so I'm just want to say that the charger does work when I plugged it into my Samsung phone with the power cord so that's why I give it 5 stars
Bought for my daughter because I love mine so much! Easy to use. Can see in the dark to read before bed - not so bright as a phone so it doesn't keep me up.
Gave this as a gift, the recipient loves it and uses it daily.
My kid loves it. It's portable and convenient. I think I need one for myself.
8 year old granddaughter loves hers, and I do too!
These went like CRAZY in my high end redemption at the arcade I run.
This is helpful if you read for more than 30 minutes. I have personally noticed that after 6hr reading, I have no headache or strain in my eyes.Also battery life is unlimited. Charge it once for a couple of hours and your are good to go for 2 weeks of extensive reading.
My daughter love it and is amazing thanks and I will recommend it
I bought this because reading on my iPad started hurting my eyes. This is awesome. Love it!
Better and faster than Kindle 7". Great performance for the price.
My sons nook battery was going out this cost less than just replacing the battery and is highly recommended by family members
The Amazon echo is really amazing. It makes everything easy and friendly to use.
Great for kids. The bumper around the tablet has saved it several times. I might buy a larger screen tablet the next time around. The programs are easy to access and love the parental controls.
I have been enjoying my paperwhite. Like buying booKS and reading free books as an amazon prime membership benefit. I also bout a book that was in pdf format an I was able to read on paperwhite also
Love my amazon is amazing for the price I paid and what the tablet does i am glad not pay for a samsung tablet more expensive and do the same
Tablet is easy to use. Gives options for password as well as a protective case. 4 stars!
For under $50, it's cheap and so so with stocked firmware BUT you can root it then put a new custom firmware on it, After such you are no longer have many annoying pop up and adware from Amazon and I feel like my Fire Table is now worth at leat 2 times more than what I have paid for it.
Works great, easy to use for my 4 year old. I can adjust settings easily. Easy set up
it's nice but I need to learn more about it because it doesn't do everything I ask of it. I"d still buy it again though.
I bought it for my nephew and he loves it, he thinks me for every weekend he comes over with it !
Love the Item. Im completely satisfied with my buy.
I really like this product. Works just as advertised.
This tablet has a great price but don't let that fool you. The tablet performs much lower that other tablets I've used.
Great for reading!I only wish it could be larger and more compatible with pdf files
Its little improved than previous version. Good deal at this price.
So easy to use and so nice to have in kitchen. Looks great in white
Bought this for my aunt who could no longer enjoy reading books due to her very poor vision and she loves it. The only problem she has is when unwanted windows pop up; she's not very tech-savvy and doesn't know how to get rid of them.
Had a Google Nexus which I really liked but started having issues with the power connection. After replacing the USB connector I still had issues with it so I decided to replace it. Did my research and purchased a Kindle Fire and loved it so much I bought two more to give to my parents.
My wife love to listen the music on It warm great sound
the product is working perfectly and the service was greatThank you
Wanted to buy the Amazon echo for a long time, was glad that I saw the offer best buy had, got it around 2 weeks ago and I love it so far, for me listening to music is a big part of my day and the sound on the echo is fantastic, I really like the design, Alexa is pretty helpful even though I haven't had the chance yet to fully use her capabilities but asking for a song or ordering things from Amazon is pretty easy and convenient, I have an accent and Alexa doesnt have any problems understanding me!, would definitely recommend it.
It is a good tablet for the price and for young children.
This was a replacement for a kindle It is a good device.
Love having the Echo in the kitchen/living area! Sure wish you could link it to Apple Music.
Bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves to check temperatures outside and loves listen to the music of his choice. He would recommend this to others but is worried about the security or lack of. We have heard since that it is easy for others to spy on you because it is connected to Wifi.Overall, it seems to be a great electronic.
We bought it on a bunch and we're very pleased with the ease of use and the way our granddaughter was motivated to use it.
Easy to operate once you get the hang of it! Loooooove that it lights up so no reading light is needed. I love reading so I don't need the games, movies etc that the Fire has.
Spending money on the cheaper one with ads is worth it. The ad only pops up when you first turn it on and that's it. Have not had any issues with it in the few weeks we've had it.
Although I had a Roku three that did most of what I needed, Playstation Vue isn't available but it is available on the Fire TV. If you have a prime membership, this is probably for you. If you are one of the people that don't like me, this is nothing but a way for amazon to get you to buy more stuff from them. You can't set the menu's to only show the content that you own and the apps that you have downloaded can't be put first on the list.
Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants.
Great quality for the price. Great for kids as it's not a huge loss if it breaks, though I still recommend getting a protective cover for it.
I now have two. Alexa is awesome. I use it every day.
Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display
Lightweight, easy on the eyes, easy to use, many wonderful features
After reading the reviews, it's an awesome gadget added to the collection!
Easy device for my in-laws who are not tech savvy.
Works flawlessly with amazon users especially those with prime accounts.
GAVE THIS TO MY WIFE. IT SERVES IT'S PURPOSE GREAT PRICE.
This product is awesome. The echo plays songs and answer questions. I can't wait to add the thermostat and light control modules.
This is such an improvement over the original Kindle. The pages are easier to read in any light.
This was a gift for my 18 year old little sister. Well worth it for the price, she really likes it
Was a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it was okay.
I love the preloaded apps. There are 1000 to choose from for all ages. The book selection is expansive. My 3 year old plays with it everyday. Its great for trips in the car or just being around the house. Great Buy!!! I enjoy playing with Alexa....ask her anything and she has an answer.
Still discovering what it can do but it is a great item
This is a great little tablet. The price is unbeatable. I have been using mine for about a month. Never a problem. Easy to download good graphics and always plenty of free downloads to entertain!
Husband loved my KF so much I had to get one for him for X-mas. He kept "borrowing" mine! Easy to use, even most technically declined can handle.
Gets the job done
Highly recommend buying this product. We were purchasing cable through our cable co. and paying nearly $200 for a bundled plan. And we hardly have time to even watch live television! But with this device we are able to catch up on programs, series, news and our favorite movies at our leisure and pause and pick up whenever we want. And after searching other sites and stores we found that Best Buy has the best price overall. And super great customer service as well.
The Amazon fire TV device is incredibly fast very cost-effective and super reliable. Great for gaming movies television and a lot more. I love it! Buy it now.
My grandchildren love this. Its the perfit size for them and ot allows them to do all the things they want. The price was also great, much less than a large tablet.
Each of my three kids got this for Christmas ages 10,8,7. They all use for various reasons. The deal we made was you have a to read a book a week unless it is really long. The kids have used it to read but play games as well. A nice gift for forty bucks
I actually ended up returning this item because I got frustrated with the adds. If it wasn't for that I probably would have given it 5 stars.
I recommend this tablet !!! I like it a lot , perfect size and perfect price
Great way to listen to your music through all of your accounts and play lists. The voice commands make it real simple. I
I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too.
Oh my, oh my, oh my! Amazon can do no wrong! This device is my precious!
After receiving another extremely high cable bill, I decided to cut the cord! The Amazon Fire is awesome. We subscribed to Playstation Vue which has an app on the Fire that you can access.We can also access our Amazons and Netflix accounts right from the Fire. Great product, wish I would have done this sooner.
A welcome addition to online streaming. Easy menu and controls for navigation.No buffering issues noticed.
I purchased for Christmas gifts, kids are loving so far!
One of the best purchases I could have made. I don't even have cable at home now because of this
My fire stick is one of the best electric devices I have ever bought.
It was very easy to download and read the books in the tablet
Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
Purchased this for my nephew. He loved it and can't stop playing with it.
Great little streaming device. Mainly use for Netflix and Playstation Vue
Item was a replacement for an earlier version whose battery was declining / not holding charge. Replacement was more cost effective than battery replacement. An added bonus is the fact the the newer device is faster.
Alexa is fantastic, she is helpful, excellent voice recognition, it can help with many tasks. My home is smart because of Alexa. I recommended this product.
This is a great easy to use tablet! Very affordable!
The Voyage is my first eReader and I am not disappointed. It is light, clear and a joy to use
I gave the Echo to my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it.
The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.
Great product and integrates well with the Amazon suite of products. Closing in on Apple Ipad
I bought 6 of these for christmas for my nieces and nephews. Best gift for the price. they love them for the online and app games.
I love my new Kindle! I have owned them all and each one improves on the last. It's a great way to read! I have the origami book cover as well and did not expect to like it but actually, I love it!
I just love my echo, I have taught her a ton of new tricks.
Very nice improvements from earlier models. Resolutions better and greatly reduced sun glare. Certainly worth the investment.
It is an easy to use tablet and my girl love it! Great price.
So much fun news weather and music at your voice command
No question about it this is the best e ink e reader available. Much easier on the eyes for long reading sessions that any tablet, even one with a sharp screen like an iPad Air/Mini or top of the line Samsung.
Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use.
The sound is better at mid to low volumes, but at max the voices are great... I also have the Echo tap and the echo dot... They all work Great,,, This one for sure has a bigger sound...
best decision I made this month. best tablet for the best price
My child is very satisfy with his tablet. He really enjoy watching videos and play games. Is worth it.
I bought this for my aunt. She reads all the time. As she got older she hated carrying multiple books with her everyday and when she traveled. This Kindle solved all those problems. She especially likes being able to read magazines, periodicals, and check out library books electronically. She loves this thing!!
It's great. I use it every day. Love the voice commands.
Profound content provided by this TV box. Plus 3rd party apps, you can watch free tv and sports.
Very pleased with this product after downloading Kodiak and the Exodus add-ons. Since then I have added numerous add-ons just like getting apps from an app store. It's well worth the cost and I haven't even bothered to maximize the potential of this little critter yet.
I am loving this tablet. I bought it during the Black Friday special just to check it out. Ended up buying a second one for my 3 yr old. Now that I know how good they are, I would not hesitate to purchase one at full price. I use it daily for my email, games and web surfing. I have also listened to music, read a couple of books and watched videos. I will say that you do need to remember that it is a $50 tablet, so don't expect to get $200 worth of tablet! But keep your expectations realistic and you will not be disappointed.
Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it!
Purchased this table for my five year old daughter and she loves it. Placed parental controls on the tablet so she can't make purchases or search the web. Very easy to use and has great apps. May get one myself!
Works well with Amazon's services, hands free Spotify and news too. The speaker sounds great centralized in a large area, and the voice recognition is extremely accurate. Looking forward to getting into the home automation aspect soon.
Very nice basic kindle fire. Amazon has improved the fire quite a bit.
I like the large display, it is very readable for this old man's eyes. The colors are vibrant and crisp. It plays videos well. I love the Amazon Underground absolutely free apps and games. The only drawback for me is the Amazon modified Android OS. I'm slowly figuring it out. The cameras leave a lot to be desired, although they are not the reason I bought this. It is a bit heavy for me, but with a folio it is easier to hold. I also bought the tempered glass screen protector.
its great
Well, since I have to use up at least sixty characters in this review, I can say it woks.
I have Sonos. Speaker of echo is not that much better like sonos, but I can talk with Alexa all day. Must have product for single people.
It was the best Christmas Present for my grandson.
As a book snob/purist - I put off buying a kindle for ages. After doing a lot of travelling and lugging around paperbacks, I decided it was time to grow up and get over it. While it may not have the satisfaction of turning a physical page, it makes up for it by weighing practically nothing, only having to have one hand free and being able to read it outdoors. Battery life is amazing - will last over a month with moderate use. Have been trying to convince all the other book lovers in my family to get one!.
It's a lot of fun to play with. He artificial intelligence is good. It makes things easy to do.
Love this device! Processor is fast enough to stream Netflix & Hulu without buffering but also has enough memory for the kids to download games and pandora and their apps that the love. Pay the extra $$$ and get a quality streaming device.
Bought for the rugrat for the summer. So far she loves it!
As I stated before, excellent gift for the grandkids.
if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better, better screen and more space
I purchased two of these during Black Friday for $39. My kids love using these!!!
I have an original Kindle Fire and am really enjoying my new updated version. Larger screen and very easy to navigate.
As usual Amazon does it again. Fabulous ereader. Love the auto adjustment of the on board light!
Best tablet you can get in the price range. Very dependable and hasn't had any issues. Got it for my mom for reading books and doing some internet browsing. Was very easy for her to learn and my kids use it when they are at her house too. Would recommend.
Love it more then a fire stick. Not as much lag and runs so much faster
I am really enjoying this reader. The light is adjustable for all types of lighting! It is small enough to put in my purse to carry anywhere!
Love this thing. It's very useful and a lot of fun to have!
I bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son. It's fast and easy to use.
Love using my Kindle Paperwhite. The best feature is the ability to adjust the backlight when reading in different locations.
I bought this tablet for my senior citizen mother and it is easy for her to use.
Bought this so my brother could watch his videos on something other than my phone.
So much fun asking questions and getting weather. Useful timer and calendar. Love playing my Pandora.
Love my Amazon Echo, very responsive, mainly use it for weather and music. Answers any questions I have. Soon I will connect it to some lights, for a start
My kids and I decided to get this for my wife for mother's day. She absolutely loves it.
Bought for my 5 & 7 year olds. They love them. Easy to use. Highly recommend.
I purchased three of these tablets as Christmas gifts for my kids. It was a great deal since Best Buy had them on sale for $33/ea. They were very excited to get their own tablet. The 7 inch is a bit small for my taste, however, great for kids. The Amazon service that provides ample apps for kids is a great deal since you can add up to four kids on one account.
I hesitated initially when purchasing this tablet, mostly because I have never had a tablet or e-reader and wasn't sure I could figure out how to use it. Even though this table comes with virtually no instructions, there is a lot of information online and it is very intuitive, even for a total novice. Now, just about a month since my purchase, I am loving this tablet so much and am so happy I purchased it. The price break made it an even sweeter purchase.
When you can get this thing on sale it's an amazing deal. Have all of your Amazon features right in your face. Books, Manga, Gaming, Amazon. It's easy to hold, has amazing battery life and has a pretty decent screen. Sure the Galaxy tablets have better specs, but it's the price and features you get from Amazon that make this device amazing!
She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games
it is white, and it is much better than kindle 6, so paperwhite is a very good product.
I love the picture quality. Sometimes losing internet connection. I wish it has Time Warner App.
works great for kids bought three for Christmas no complaints
Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast.
tablet is so user friendly and a price you can not beat
Echo is awesome. I now have two echos and one dot. Works great with my home automation. Actually has pretty good sound.
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grand babies.
I have looked at getting a Kindle for over a year and have looked at the specs and also other tablets. I enjoy reading and when traveling have to pack 4-6 books when I cruise. I decided to get the Kindle Fire - great price and get it a try. I love it and will someday upgrade to a larger model. Have read 5 books all ready and have 30 more waiting to be read. Great one to start using an ereader.
Works great. Is a good upgrade for those who have a regular kindle. Terrific for low light reading.
Nothing will replace the joy of flipping through the pages of a book, but living in a studio apartment with my girlfriend, I simply don't have the space for all the books I'd like to own on top of the ones I have now.I got this for my girlfriend because she has difficulty reading on my iPad Air. She has no difficulty using her Kindle Voyage, and she thoroughly enjoys it.I'm actually thinking of getting one for myself farther down the line.
I love this little device. It's perfect for reading anywhere and anytime, especially great to use in the dark after my hubby is asleep. Most back lit devices hurt my eyes by this one doesn't bother them at all.
Lots of apps for kids. My 5yr old loves it. Great buy.
Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
Have not used for standard fire tv features. Bought to run kodi, which it works fine for. Freezes occasionally needing hard reboot. Worth the extra $ over doing kodi on streaming stick which lacks memory / cpu.
It takes a little getting used to if you are used to Android
Makes charging time quicker.
I purchased this for a 5 year old so they'd leave my iPad alone. So happy I did. Easy to use and live that you cad increase memory to
Easy to use and lots of features. Would recommend this item.
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! She has the iPad but this Kindle Fire 8hd is so much easier to use for books and the occasional solitaire game. I am glad I bought the 32mb as I would rather have too much storage space than not enough. Great product and very easy to read books on.
Very Nice upgrade! Love the speed to watch movies and to play games!
Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too.
Good for reading and watching netflix.Small and easy to carry.
This device works well and however there is no clear way to tell what programming is free with subscription or what requires a fee.
I love the Amazon HD8! It is a great tablet for reading and surfing the web! It has a fast processor and amazing resolution. I would definitely purchase this product again.
Have this set up in the living room. Make sure to mute it when you're watching Youtube videos or stuff will start happening...and you'll run out screaming...which I've found can be very embarrassing.
I bought it for my 8 years old sister and it's perfect. Screen is clear and the price was great
extra tablet for the price well worth it using it for everyday extras ..eg weather app , face book, kindle,
This product is very easy to use and we are very happy to have it.
I love the parental controls. The tablet has been great.
My family love the Echo/Alexa specially my kids you can ask almost anything to Alexa
My wife loves reading on the tablet. It's also great for surfing the web.
This was my 3rd Kindle and 2nd Fire Kindle!!! I use it for EVERYTHING!!! Hardly use the laptop at ALL anymore. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!
Was about to purchase another tablet for more money else where when another shopper informed me of the Kindle Fire being available at Best Buys for $49. Was able to purchase a name brand tablet for less. I was all in. Going to Best Buys to make the purchase was well worth the trip and the price. The Kindle Fire has not let me down to date. I can read books, google, read my email and most things I can do on my computer.
I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I 've had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon.
This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage
My son has always like the idea of a smart home. While that isn't in our future, having Alexa in his room makes him feel like he can walk into his room and request music or have a question answered like he is sone sort of Tony Stark lol. Great buy!
Great tablet. Drop it many times and its still working.
Already had one but bought a couple more when they went on sale.
Love being able to tell what I need on my shopping list
I love the light weight for the size! Fun tablet!!!
Surprisingly good picture quality and easy to use.
This is a good product, value for money. It has everything one can expect in low price tablet.
Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
When used with AMAZON Prime and the "FreeTime" app for kids this is a great tablet. Installed a 64 gb micro SD and install as many apps to the card as possible to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 5 year old granddaughter.
Love how it is easy , kid friendly, and my son loved it.
I was somewhat skeptical about getting this tablet, and especially for that low of a price. But no later than 1 week I went back and purchased another one for my wife. This Amazon Kindle Fire is awesome.
It was easy to set up the echo. Works great, still learning what Alexa can do, My wife love it.
So fun to be able to ask Alexa how to spell a word or what is the weather. Also let her pick out music while I am busy doing housecleaning. I am continually amazed at the things she will do. Even set up an exercise program!
Small, light easy to read in any lighting. If you are looking for a device that serves one purpose, to read books anywhere, this is for you.
Great for outdoors while seating in the sun reading
I bought this tablet for my husband for him to use a home. He likes that he can sit anywhere and use it. He has a big laptop and does not transport well. He said he did not want a tablet, but he uses everyday. The only downfall on this tablet is that when you turn it on it advertises some online game and you have to wait for it to go away before you can use it.
This works as advertised...I use it every day.Sounds great...quality made.It's like having another family member.So glad we got it!
I love this! I use it daily! And I love the fact that I can add a ad card for more memory!
Love this device, enjoying everyday its in my home. I actually purchased another one.
when I bought the tablet I was not sure if she could advance on but she has done very well thanks
Great product for watching movies or using with kodi doesn't heat up as quickly as the smaller firestick
Alexa can do everything from playing music, turning on lights to regulating your thermostat
Love the kindle tablet for my kids and grandkids. Very easy to use even for a 2 year old. I would highly recommend buying the screen protector and durable case.
Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho
The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games.
Alexa is nice but it lacks a lot of informayion when asking questions. It's not like your smart phone that you can ask anything and will give you the answer. Only to certain thing and you have to email el certain apps in the Alexa app itself to work. Still working on Alexa so maybe that could be the reason but I though it would be like Siri that you can ask anything.
We already had one Amazon fire tablet and liked it so much that we decided to purchase another for the grandkids to use when they come over.
Great for Kindle.
Faster processor and instant response time. Works as advertised. Way ahead then Roku on features and offering.
I purchase two of this tablets and I have to say I haven't had any issues with them. Perfect for kids.
I liked it so much I will e getting all my grandkids one for birthdays from now on.
You cant go wrong with this tablet. I use this for media consumption but mainly for my 8month old baby to bring around and play nursery rhymes. Had a 4gb micro sd laying around, filled it with videos and downloaded a video player app. No more worrying about losing an ipad or my phone tied up with playing his videos. Get the 16$ 2 yr warranty from amazon too. Theyll replace tablet 3 times within 2 yrs no questions ask.
Amazon has this one perfect. The backlight makes it easy to read.
I bought them for my kids for Christmas. They LOVE them!
Any one who doesn't want to spend too much money and get a tablet for kids it is perfect for them.
My first Kindle and I love it. No backlight and perfect view in the sun are awesome.
If you aren't tech savvy, know someone who is to be able to get Alexa to respond. Amazon was kind enough to email me to offer support; I'm afraid the first question will be, "Is it plugged in?" I'm not tech savvy, but I also have some sense.
Having owned each of the previous Kindle readers, this one is without a doubt the best of the bunch. I highly recommend that the serious reader consider this device. Do note that this is a Reader, not a tablet. Grab an iPad or Kindle Fire for your tablet needs but get this to read books. The high dot-per-inch count makes it easy on the eyes, as does the evenly-distributed light. Superb device!
Overall - good quality for the cost. Ease of use; functionality is beneficial and allows for great entertainment.
Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it.
Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
Good product with good features. Like the suggestion books in email.
The echo has be a nice addition to the home. Helps connect other devices and Amazon features. Great speaker quality. Fun to use
It is nice to get information on the spot when needed.
This was a inexpensive replacement for a device that was damaged by my kids. Would continue to purchase if needed. Great for kids 5-6 years old.
This Table is good for children because won't break if dropped. However, the only problem I have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same Table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use.
This is so easy to operate and fun too! I love it!!
Download is slow but after its on the tablet. It works great good buy
i actually purchased for a friends daughter and she is very happy
I love this, it has so much . Music, Weather. It is worth every penny.
By far the best streaming device in the market. I have one for every room in my house.
I just bought it like a couple of weeks ago and I'm already telling my fMily to get it. Love it. It works perfectly
For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
This was a gift but I also own an Echo of my own that I have had for over a year. I use it daily and would not be with out it. They are always adding more thing that it can do and it has almost become a member of the family.
Fast, easy, and mobile! Connects through WiFi and directly. Easy to move from one room to another.
i no longer us tv this is my new go to for my tv show needs
Met all my expectations! Lightweight and compact. I enjoy using the product.
Gave this as a gift for Christmas to my daughter's family. They loved it!
Everyone one in my house loves the Amazon Echo. Can't wait to see what new skills will be added in the days and years ahead. Alexa is a whole lotta fun!
It was the the perfect gift for my 7 year old grand daughter. She read 3 books the first evening.
A bit difficult to get working with other smart home devices. After Some trial and error with my smart things hub, and IFTT commands it works great. Would increase to five star review if it was a bit easier to get up and running.
It's perfect, my granddaughter loves it!! She's catching on so fast and learning so much!! Easy for travel and on the go
The sound is amazing -- we mostly play music but also use it to answer questions for fun. I just wish it was wireless. I bought a 2nd one since I loved it so much!
I like this tablet very much. Good for kids to use and cost is low. Quality of touch screen is excellent. My kid can watch youtube cartoons, play games perfectly.
To start with, this is not a high end tablet. This serves the fundamental purpose of browsing and reading with so much ease. Believe me, a lot better than an a low end ASUS tablet. I own multiple tablets of varying brands. This tablet works like a charm. For the price offered, its worth the purchase.
Has everything you need to live stream. I have 4 Apple TV and wish I would have know about the Fire TV first
Great e-book reader, soft on the eyes with no glare. will not buy any more paperbacks.
Bought this for my husband for Valentine's Day. We have the philips hue bulbs which this syncs with which is really nice. Love that you can ask it questions, how's the traffic to work etc.
I have two boys, 5 and 7, they empty the tablet's battery everyday playing, still working perfect.And parental control is very good.
Got my granddaughter one & i surprisely received one for Christmas! Now i can do more while laying in bed! And my grandbaby get to watch Nick jr. On jer own leisure!
It does what was expected and glad I got thisbinsteadbof the next level up because of the difference in features is not worth the difference in price.
Fast interface, great for people with prime membership. voice search working well. It would have been nicer if the menu is flexible we can see third party apps along with the apps installed from amazon store.
I have 3 amazon fire sticks already. The box runs a little faster and I haven't experienced any lag times with the menus. The voice control works surprisingly well.
I purchased it because my friends utilize a program that allows me to stream everything for free on the Firestick. I wanted to see if the connection would be better and so far it has been awesome. I also had him install a lot of old games like Mario Kart, Donkey Kong, Centierpede & overall I'm just happy with my purchase.
Easy to use, light, sturdy. Purchased case on ebay. Great price. Wish it would work with chromecast. Sketchy Fios updates but resolved.
We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them.
love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table
Good for kids and adults sometimes it takes a little time to pull up old movies but shows great.
Having so much fun with Echo I bought 4 of them. One for each floor in my home. I have them connected to smart home and can control my home. I intercom between rooms and get calls from my kids on the echo. Getting better all the time.
It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.
One of those things that you never realize you needed until you actually get it. I can't imagine not having this thing now! Definitely recommended
Nice tablet, gives different choices for readers. Easy to use.
Not for the average computer person. Very confusing instructions. I spent several hours trying to install the "overdrive" so I could get e-books from the library. Ran the battery down several times with no luck. I got so disgusted I had to just put it down. (I'm still trying because I refuse to give up) Thinking about just returning it and the nice leather case too!)
I'm not going to say this is the best tablet out there,but,for my wifes needs,it is perfect. It does everything she wants to do and more.
One of our best home purchases. The echo has been very helpful to us daily.
It gets the job done and I like it. It's really good for little kids as well
Updated features are great and easy to use. Upgraded on the advice of Geek Squad when they came out to install a new TV. I highly recommend for those looking to cut the cord!
Enjoying the kindle fire!!! Great for kids to use!!
This was an upgrade from the fire stick. Works so much faster. Stick is still great and portable but this device is good for bigger places. Works well with weak wifi.
I upgraded to the Paperwhite from an older Kindle. It's definitely an improvement over my last one and it brings some modern technology to a familiar user interface. You can't really beat what you get for the price.
Super inexpensive and easy to use. Great for my kids.
Love the size and quality. Easy to carry around and good screen quality
This is a good size tablet! It is fast and responsive.
There are cheaper Kindles and (considerably) more expensive ones, but this model hits the sweet spot. It has sufficiently high resolution to make reading comfortable, a good backlight, and is comfortable in the hand.
bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price.
Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet
The price was right, and my grandkids love them! I now own 4 of them, they are simple enough for Grandma to work.
My wife had a Nook that she loved, but it broke. The least expensive ones are more than I wanted to spend and I came across the Fire. Excellent price for a Android based tablet (with the Fire OS) and reader. With a simple 'hack' you can install the Nook app so you can keep any previous Nook books as well as using the Amazon book store. She loves it! Being Prime members, she also uses it for video.
It works great for Netflix and amazon streaming I love these boxes
My grandkids love it. They use it at home and when we travel.
Not sure what will happen if it gets dropped, Doesn't appear to adequately cover the screen, Looks really good!
I have been using the Amazon fire tv stick. Getting the box is so much smoother.
My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids.
Just what I was looking for! Family love it! Will buy it again!
Love device. Functional and easy set up. Enjoyed ability to just set up and use right away. My child liked available apps on Google play store.
I got this to upgrade my wife's original kindle fire. While it is better, the original fire was still getting it done. Actually gave it to my parents who just wanted a basic tablet.Only draw back is the ads, but you can live with it
Easy to use. No more fumbling for lite switches in the dark
Ever since I bought this kindle for my 6 year old, he has not been able to get over it. He loves it and I do too, because I "borrow" it from time to time.
Bought the echo for my husband. He love's it. Its an amazing piece of technology.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my toddler and she loves it.
My mom love this tablet. The graphics is cool and neat and my mom can see everything.
Still learning how to use this tablet, would have liked a little more direction on how to use it didn't seem to have any paper directions included..Like using this tablet especially to read books, email and facebook.
I like and use the integration for lights and thermostat but asking Alexa for answers to questions needs a lot of help. Sirius much better in providing accurate info.
Love the movies and songs it is a great product. Tx
Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family
Easy to use. Great for someone who wants to play some games and use simple apps.
My old Kindle finally wouldn't charge any more so I went to Best Buy to see if it could be fixed. Too bad! It couldn't! SOOOO, I got a new one that is amazing! And it is so user-friendly I figured out how to borrow books from the library all by myself! Couldn't be any more pleased.
The sound is good, worth a try. The minus thing is they need to improve the voice recognize
Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
The sound is good and voice volume control is real nice. There are skills you need to find to do really so much. Learning what to say is getting better for me. I plan on buying a dot next.
Apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing. I'm telling you, generic tablets are faster... I thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast. I first noticed this after I started using it but I thought I would give it a shot. I've decided to return this and exchange for another $50 tablet tomorrow. This is because I couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.Here's what I did like. It's name brand. The games are nice and mostly ad free. It uses Android 5.0 but uses their own app store. Reading books is great. Library app is kinda slow but still works.Perfect cheap tablet for kids age 6 to 13 maybe...
Size is perfect for little hands, Great features and excellent reviews. Great amount of space needed for use.
I had to buy myself another of these 9W chargers because so many other USB chargers are relatively useless. I have chargers that won't even put out enough power to use the device while it is charging, and in fact, some devices discharge completely if you leave them on while they are charging.The 9W charger does a great job, and eventually, I might have a 9W charger both at my desk and near my bed.I highly recommend this product.
My kids loved it. They use it daily. I would recommend to any parent.
Awesome tablet my wife loves it, got it for a present, read books surf the net watch Hulu and Netflix real cheap
The tablet is good for a child between the ages of 5-18. Great purchase!
Purchased on Black Friday Deal. 71 yr. old mom loves it and uses daily for reading.
For 35$ to get a reputed tablet is a no brainer. I am enjoying it!
Fast on internet, easy connection. Easy to use. Clear display. Was looking at iPad mini. After reading reviews of both Kindle fire and iPad I bought the Kindle for so much less $$$ And I don't have to put up the Apple's native apps etc.
Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.
The Amazon Echo can be used for so many different reasons such as to do list, shopping list, and creating a smart home. I LOVE IT!!!!
Great learning tool and tough exterior makes it the PERFECT gift for a three year old.
My daughter loves it! This device provided all the services she wanted.
Good product. Good speed. But freeze many time. Recommend a power on button on remort controll
I only use this for simple stuff, and so far I have no complaints. I bought it for thirty something bucks and all I can say is what a deal.
Picked this up for a 7 year old. I'm used to using iPads, but not a bad little tablet for a kid and Im not worried if if something happens to it.
Was a great deal for my daughter for Christmas, her last one broke.
Simply put its exactly what I expected. I've had zero problems with it
This device works great and is capable of so much!
I like the Amazon Tap. I use it as a speaker in my garage for working out. It is tied to my Amazon Echo. I am able to use Alexa and Amazon Prime material. Would highly recommend.
This was the fourth ECHO we have purchased. The first one was for home, an award from RealtyUSA.com. The last three were Christmas presents for all the Grandchildren. they just love it. When we are out our dogs listen to classical music on the ECHO!
My son who is eight loves this tablet. Great for road trips and really works for the price. Hey let's be honest kids need something to keep them busy, this works fast, easy to start up.
If everything continues to hold up then I will be a repeat buyer!
I bought for my son, and he loves it. In his home they use it daily. Great gift for him and his family.
This little black box is awesome. So easy to setup and use. The choices of entertainment are outstanding
This was a great addition to our home. Ask Alexa anything from what the weather is to jokes or play our favorite music. Highly recommend it for any home.
I got this to specifically put in my kitchen to help me keep timers and convert measurements. The shopping list is an awesome addition as well whenever I finish something that I regularly use in my kitchen. Would definitely recommend for any cook and it's only going to get better with firmware updates!
So far I like it, but wish the App Store had the game I play. I haven't done anything else but read so can't comment on other things.
Works like a charm and am Bert pleased with my purchase
I really like this kindle. It's small enough to throw in my purse and the battery lasts forever. I really like it!
I love playing classic rock and that plays it great.
This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive.
It's a great tablet the price was excellent best buy in boardman ohio
Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward.
These days, Amazon doesn't supply a charger when you purchase a new Kindle. That makes sense because most Kindle purchasers probably have older Kindle models already, or other USB powered devices or phones or tablets, many of which will have included chargers. As a result most people will already have a sufficient supply of chargers sitting around.But for someone who wants or needs a new charger when they order a new Kindle, Amazon presents you with the option to buy one at the time of your Kindle purchase.So I was surprised when I noticed this new charger model now being offered as an option for new Kindles. My first thought was that Amazon had updated their previous charger models to bring them up-to-date and make them competitive with the great variety of third party chargers now available (see links below for these earlier models).As soon as I looked at the specs for this charger though, I was disappointed. Unfortunately, even though this is Amazon's latest basic charger offering, it is not in my opinion the best choice for someone who needs a USB charger, for a Kindle or for anything else for that matter. And that's something I wouldn't usually find myself saying, because usually Amazon's accessories are reasonably priced and competitive.This is certainly a capable and functional charger, and it will work perfectly fine with any Kindle device and charge it acceptably well. But here are the reasons why I feel this is not the best choice:- It will supply only 1 A output, maximum. That's sufficient for a Kindle e-reader but not sufficient for many other devices. Any of the Fire devices, for example, will benefit from a higher output charger in order to reduce charging time.Read more
You never feel alone when Alexa is around. She is like another member of the family.
I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.
Bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids. Battery lasts longer than most tablets, the reason why I gave this such a mediocre rating is because you can't put a wallpaper for the lock screen. You always have an ad for something Amazon related, which can be annoying. But if it's just something small for the kiddos to use, good choice. I wouldn't recommend for adults.
Old charger was taking forever to charge the device so I went in to Best Buy and found this comparable charger and it works great!
We now have 2 of these in our home because we love this model kindle
I used to have the Amazon stick which I thought was good until I got my hands on the Amazon TV,Faster processor = less bufferingGreat picture qualityEndless choices for programmingIf you don't have one go get one you won't regret.Best Buy customer service in Signal Hill Ca 5 stars
I love using to check my e-mails, go facebook, trying to figure how to use the camera. Once I do I'll start using it.
I really like them because I can get on my computer
The Fire tablet is a a great size and works well as an e-reader. There are also some nice apps available, but I was disappointed that although it is billed as an android tablet, I was unable to use some apps available from the Android store.
Has endless possibilities with other smart home integrations. Lots of apps make it even more useful.
has all the features you will need in a tablet. look no further
it works great. the resolution is excellent. the streaming is great. loving it so far. just a bit pricy
Does exactly what you wanted to, very nice looking seems to be a solid product
Good tablet for reading books you love... still need to get used to it since all I have used in the past are apple products .
fast and responsive, love the interface, lots of content to watch
Great price. My kids (5 years old) love it, they can download games and browse the web without a problem.
Love my echo.. after work relaxing listening to music having a glass.. its a keeper
It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it's pretty good
I enjoy this product. So easy to attach and use by all
Very fast, no buffering and better than fire stick when you use hardwired Ethernet.
I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long.
Basically has almost the same content as a Roku 3 would provide, but in a much more clunkier menu. I can get a better Amazon menu layout via the Amazon app on the Roku 3. Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me.
I love my Kindle Fire! I like the bigger screen of the HD8 versus the 7.
I bought this for my two-year-old son to play games on so I wouldn't panic if he dropped it. It is also a great tool for you fire apps and Amazon Apps.
Sound is great can talk to echo from any room on same floor
Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
My mom's not to tech savvy but this opened her world and made every day things she does on her computer at her finger tips while comfortably sitting in her living room or on road trips! About road trips she can book a room just sitting in her car that might of unavailable once she got Inside. I have seen this happen. Smart phones are great but when you get older to have a full screen makes it much easier! She loves also loves to read and there are so many books on Amazon she no longer has to run out the door to the book store or library Very helpful and fun when she can sit down and enjoy a card game with multiple players all over the world when no one is home!
if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside .
Its a good tablet with very nice screen and functions. As with amazon fire tablets , you are stuck with apps on amazon and you may not get too many variety and good quality apps. If you are ok with Amazon apps, this is a fine nice tablet.. If you need good and verities of apps, go for android tablet.
I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.
We were looking for a good tablet at an affordable price. This one has definitely met our expectations and we hope to use it for a long time!!!
This is the second Amazon Fire 7 tablet I have purchased, this time in a color other than black. This, like the first, has met all my expectations.
The Amazon Echo is great! My whole family is enjoying it. I got it for Father's day, and have used daily since then. Alexa is amazing! Her voice recognition is unbelievable, and it even compensates for my foreign accent. My only complaint is that the the Echo volume isn't high enough for me. That's why I gave it a 4-star rating.
I love my Kindle Paperwhite. It was easy to set up and I have absolutely no complaints. I reviewed different e-readers and decided on the paperweight because I could read it outside with no issues. I have tested it in the bright sun light and had no problem with any glare. Even with the sun shining directly on it.
i love the alex. it has made me upgrade my smart house to work with it. i have insteon hub, harmony hub, smartthings hub and now a philps hue hub. they all work over voice with alexa. i even got 2 amazon tv sticks and 1 tv unit. all working together. love it
This was purchased as a replacement for an aging third party e-reader. It is light weight, compact, easy on the eyes while reading and has a long battery life. The Kindle library has a wide variety of books, many of which are free. The one draw back for some people may be that the lock-screen has ads. This is only on the lock-screen, the ads don't appear while using the device and Amazon can permanently remove the ads for a fee.
This is the second one we have purchased and we really enjoy it.
A lot faster than Siri, very responsive and helpful in the kitchen playing music Multiple timers and measurements
this amazon fire table is a great bargain. its not a top of the line table and you can tell since the moment you see the price tag but for that price does a whole lot! day to day regular use or just for kids and people that dont really care about some extra features that flagship tablet bring its amazon!
Great product and easy to set up. I have recommended it to others that have seen it in action.
I had a Kindle Fire and upgraded to the 5th generation. Could not be more pleased with this tablet.
It's a great device it works great, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it doesn't have the same "google" search as ok google does
I bought this and we have had no problems at all with it
Compared to Dish Prices, this is a good option. It allows you to customize TV stations to a degree. It has the potential to replace dish in the long run if you have an internet connection.
I love this kindle paperwhite. I can read it anywhere especially the beach.
I love how user friendly it is. It was a gifts for my daughter who is not very good with technology. She loves it!
The tv has the same functionality as my stick. The program choices are excellent.
Awesome device for home automation. Great for quick info queries. I added 2 smart outlets very easily.
The light from the page does not but a strain on your eyes when reading. I like how light it is to hold.
Unfortunately we did not purchase one of these to keep for ourselves, we gave both of them away to our children at Christmas!
I bought one for myself and a few others for a raffle. This is a great tablet for a great price. It doesn't have all of the apps that the google store has, but Amazon underground has some great free apps. It's got good external storage options and a fast processor. I highly recommend.
I purchased this for my family and put in the family room. Everyone likes to use it for music, trivia, sports scores and just having some fun. Sometimes it doesn't understand the question or have the answer.
I bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale. I've been pleasantly surprised. Search sounds great for its size.
I purchased the Amazon Echo to use in the house and I haven't been disappointed. It plays music, gives me weather and answers most questions. My family has found it very handy to have around.
Bought this for my Daughter who loves using it. It's lots of fun to ask for a daily joke.
This is a descent tablet for kids. Not all amazon apps are compatible with this is device which can get annoying. Storage is limited (8gb) so that too can get annoying. (Especially when 4gb is used before you ever get started.) Video quality is great but picture quality is lacking. Overall the tablet is easy to use and my children (8 & 12) enjoy using it. I gave it 4 stars because for the cost I think it is a pretty good tablet.
I can make a grocery list, request my favorite songs, turn my lights on / off all with my Amazon Echo!!!
Bought this for my nieces and nephews and they love it. Parental controls are easy to set.
Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing.
Transitioning away from standard tv and this worked great!
I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
Kids love it and use it a lot. No issues till now.
Love the fact i can watch amazon prime with out video to voice delay
I really liked it, even though I purchased for my grand daughters. I have a 6 HD Fire, but I liked this one better. With the expansion slot for space
A bit dissapointed in local station reception. Fire tv is not what was expected. OK, but just not as expected.
This works perfect for what I need it for. Great addition.
I bought two of these as Christmas gifts and my little sisters absolutely love these!! Almost as fast as my iPad. Hopefully they continue to work this way.
Found that this device is extremely convenient, but it often has problems with buffering. They seem to mostly come from outside apps so that's why I am still giving it a 4.
I gave these tablets to my g/daughters and there is so much that they can do with it. They come with great apps, which I think they will enjoy for years to come. Also the price was great bargain.
This is a great tablet for small children and for anyone who is looking to use it for a reading tablet or the internet. It is a bit slow but not to the point where it is frustrating.
Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.
Works as advertised very happy with my purchase controls my Hue Philips lights my light strip
Everything work well i like it alot good enough for me
The Amazon Tap has great sound and plays most of my requests. Easy to use and easy to set up.
Great product. Excellent for small business, kids etc. Good on the go.
Awesome little tablet. Kids love it and they use it all the time.
Great tablet! New to me so I have a lot to learn about it's functions.
This tablet is well worth the money. It has descent performance and good screen resolution. And it is definitely a great tablet for beginners. This is the one for those who don't want to spend more on tablets.
I purchased this for my mother to use primarily to check Facebook and watch Netflix. I was a little bit disappointed to find out that there was not a Vudu app available. I hope that one is in the development stages. I knew that this was not a full out tablet when I bought it, but had hoped that since it was based on Android, it would have the major Android apps.
Better then the older models bigger and better then before
Love using this. So easy to download and find books, so easy to store, the battery life is amazing. It's like reading a book without the hassle of the space, being able to look up words while reading it amazing. The only thing I wish is that I had gotten one sooner!
She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL
This is the 2nd one our family has. Perfect for kids games & watching videos.
I purchased this two weeks ago and we have watched it every night. It is extremely fast, has 4k content and has a nice voice remote
Got this while on sale & used Best Buy points ! Got it for super cheap . Being a Prime member makes this worth while. So far the Fire TV has performed flawlessly. There are many apps to choose from, some not available on my Apple TV . This box is 4K ready with some Prime eligible titles to stream . The interface is not quite as nice as Apple TV but works ok . I would say it is worth what I paid and then some !
I love my Amazon Fire TV box. It is so quick and I have access to so many Apps and programs. I recommend it to everyone.
Great item. You get so much from such a small box. It's definitely worth the money.
it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon....
Good deal, great product, a nice little addition to our home!
At first I thought my reader was broken but discovered, by accident, that my touch must be very light.
Sound is great and the voice recognition is amazing. Love it.
Dad loves it love love love it love it love it love
Great to download books, movies, music. Easy to navigate. Would recommend!!!!#
I really was pleasantly surprised by how well Alexa is able to understand the commands
Exceeded my expectation. Easy to read, books load and store with ease ! Great for saving space for avid reader. I can travel with many books dont have to worry about space
I love this so much, I bought two! Also bought one for my parents. It is really easy to start up. Walks you right through the install process. I highly recommend.
Bought this tablet to replace a digit and one that was on recall. The Amazon ecosystem is nice and the tablet seems to work pretty well. I like the options for limiting screen time especially being able to get nature that reading goals are met FIRST. Unit needs more on board memory however. Make sure to buy an sd card to expand.
Remote is just the right size and it gives you an instant response.
Good for searching the web & email. Good game apps. A bit disappointed that I don't have access to apps thru google & some videos will not play.
backlight feature is great for reading on an airplane when overhead lights are too bright.
We have two laptops and smart phones but love having the tablet to use instead of our phones
Bought this as a gift at holiday.She loves the size and ease of use. Good reception performance.
It's so nice being able to listen to whatever we want to listen to! She tells some pretty corny jokes, too!
I went with the Amazon Fire TV due to its flexibility to sideload Android apps but also be more forgiving than the regular Android builds. If you have Amazon Prime, this is the only way to watch it on an Android box. I wish Amazon would update its apps as quickly as the Google Play store does but overall, I have no real complaints.
Bought for my 8 year Old Granddaughter. She loved it
.great for small children.. Easy to set up and use
More intelligent than siri however speaker performance is lacking when used for music. Sonos play1 or bose soundlink has much better sound.
Installed the Kodi program on this & it works better then Netflix - I get to watch the latest shows for FREE.
Excellent Black Friday deal. My 17 year old son was very excited to go to Black Friday, so after Thanksgiving dinner we walked down to Best Buy and were so surprised to find it busy, but organized and easy to see items and find great deals!
Many features packed into a low price. Good as an ereader or light tablet uses to surf internet, email and games. Easy to use. Memory is expandable too.
Product works well and is durable. Great for kids.
Purchased for my niece as a gift. She's 2, so to watch her online videos, this is perfect!
As a starter tablet for a child this is great because it offers everything the more expensive tablets offer and it is very affordable. I wouldn't recommend this as a full service tablet because of it's speed
This is a product that I believe will be very useful.
I love love my amazon Echo. I love hearing the deals of the day from amazon and it makes shopping really easy.
I love my FireStick but the addition of 4K streaming is worth getting the FireTV. It seems to be noticeably faster as well.
My 4yo loves this. He can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. Stays charged a long time.
This item is great for me and my family. We recently have started looking for innovative ways to watch television and found this product beneficial!
My wife reads a lot and thought this would be a good gift. Being a Prime member as well as her signing up for Unlimited she can be reading something anytime which gives me time to play video games!
Have several in my home and my dad was intrigued by them and how they can be used for the smart home. Got one for him for Father's Day and he loves it. First step for him in setting up his own smart home. Next is the Samsung smart hub, hue bulbs, schlage connect and nest thermostat.
Like that I can send and receive e-mails and do general office work and use for pleasure and research.
Useful and fun tool for helping with household maintenance
I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others.
This product was extremely easy to set up and use. The whole family enjoys asking questions and the clarity of the speaker is great. We love the ability to link it to other smart products throughout the house.
I somehow feel like the Google Home would be more intuitive than Alexa. You ask her a question and her answer is " I don't understand the question" she says that more often than answer a question. Her hearing speaker is also not that great, needs to be improved upon. Great concept when linked with Harmony Hub Elite, can control more of your media devices like, TV, Receiver, Projector, game consoles., cable box but can't do any of these with out the hubs linked to it. If you purchase the smart devices such as the Lutron Caseta lighting controls, Nest Thermostat she can control your lighting too. I gave her a four because she can do all that once programmed correctly which can be a tedious process but once done she seems to work just fine. Just needs a few improvements, Amazon.
I love this product the many options and features it has is cool. My favorite is how loud the volume is and how clear the music sounds when playing it. We use it everyday
I like it is very good for all people and so simple for us
The UI experience is great, especially for Prime members. The tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task.
I purchased this for my 8 year old son, and he loves it. He can read his favorite books and play his games. Great for both education and games!
I bought this device for my wife. She has been using a Kindle Fire 7.I wanted something with a bigger screen for her.She likes it very much.
I purchased this tablet for my daughter. I can set parental controls and it has lasted her for a while.
I wanted the Amazon Echo since last year, just waited for it to go on sale. I am still learning, but I love asking Alexa to turn on my music from Pandora...it is great. Ordered the dot for my bedroom, should be in soon...
This is a great addition to our home. We use Alexa daily. We were concerned about setup and use because we are late 60s. But no sweat.Easy to use for music and lots of information. Learning more each day.
Easy to set up and easy to use! And the speaker sounds amazing.
I don't have wi fi. so I can't use the device. I'm returning it. I wanted something that my father could use as an e reader. I thought I would be able to download books via my computer using the usb cable. You can't do this unless you are registered. You cannot register unless you have wi fi. Amazon needs to fix this. This is a major flaw.
Was a great Black Friday find I enjoy playing on it . It's easy to use
The initial novelty of it was great. Had a good week of asking Alexa random questions and getting her to update me on random news and weather. Calling my friends was easy and useful when i was cooking or otherwise had dirty hands.
It really does a good job of replacing my old tablets. Market could be better but that's about it.
is a very good box work very good with wifi with movie tv show and a lot more with family tonight.
I love my Amazon Echo, don't know why I didn't get it sooner.
Love my new Kindle! I hadn't read in a while and hesitant of a kindle, easy to use, lightweight and convenient to pick up a book. great for outdoor reading. only downside is if you want to read in the dark has no back light. crisp clear text and easy to set up.
First of all I pleased on how easy it was to buy the product on line and it was here exactly the date that they said it would be. I enjoy the kindle it's easy to use.
I love the product and its easy to use would love to recommend it to friends
For the price this works fine as a reader. I had the original Fire and was disappointed when it quit charging. I'm hoping that I don't have the same problem with this.
Replaces the stereo that has been a staple in our home.
Makes reading books easier. I love it! User friendly too!
Excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at Bestbuy
It's amazing product. I love it. Amazon always provide amazing product and good price.
Love the Kindle. Very useful when traveling outside house to friends.
I am in love with the Alexa Tap. This is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest. I would recommend to all.
Item was plug and play after connecting to wireless router. Add 16g SD card to improve buffering.
However it seems their life is about 3 years. Wish it was longer
Run this with EMBY client and it works awesome. Love that it plays h265 no problem, one of the few that can actually do it. Highly recommend. ALOT FASTER than the stick in my opinion.
if you need a media player and access to Amazon Prime Video, this is the perfect device. Interface is smooth and efficient. I have one for each TV in my house.
I thought this was simply just a speaker. I brought it for that purpose and discovered it does so much more. Alexa does wonders. It is a great product to buy and you will enjoy.
The battery life is great.Last on a bus trip to kept he quiet.
This is for my 10 year old. Love the parental settings
This is a great product, and I would recommend it to everyone. My kids love it more than my wife and I.
Very happy with the firestick. Does everything that I expected.
Fun and easy to use. Must be very specfic when asking questions. Music not as good as music played on Sirius. Has good sound and can hear you speak from across the room. I would buy again and recommend to a friend.
Perfect for anyone who loves to watch any type of movie, always available at anytime,,,,
Just love it. Easy to set up and use. Tons of information and jokes. Plays all my music and give spots scores.
This is my third Kindle & each one has been excellent. My most recent purchase was the Paperwhite because of the built in light. I really enjoy reading with, especially in dark places.
Works very well and give us enjoyment to use when the family is around
It can do a lot of things. We've been using it fro music and news for the short time we've had it.
Very stable system. Pretty much identical to fire stick. Only pay more money to stream limited 4k content.
Good tablet at a low price you should buy one now .
I have bought tablets for others but this is the first time I bought for myself. This is a great price for a device that does everything.
I like this Tablet for it's size, it's easy to hold on to when reading. I can put this in my bag when travelling and it doesn't weigh much...I also love the fact that I can expand the memory, whereas the other one I have 8.9 inch doesn't have that capability...The Camera works great...The only problem I have is trying to turn it off it doesn't always want to turn off...other than that I love this Tablet...
This was the 4th one I purchased and I love them. My grandkids play on them for hours and I get to choose what games they can play.
Surprised my husband with the Amazon Echo. He is enjoying learning all about its capabilities
I love the Amazon Echo because it is so interactive. Alexa responds to your commands and the speakers are excellent.
It's a nice fast table with upgradable memory. App store provided by amazon is ok limited good apps. It's not google or IOS store but still ok. Screen resolution is great in HD streaming work really well. I recommend this tablet because it is also easy to hold, very thin and light.
Use it everyday..never had a problem,perfect for gaming ,internet,email,etc.i use it for everything.priced nice
This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!
Bought it for my nephew and he loved it. Great purchase
Can't beat the price on these tablets. They are a wonderful tablet for the money.
I was not told I had to belong to Amazon. Could not get it to work with my Router. I had been wanting this Tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. I am heart sick to have to return it. At one time working with the a general Manager by the name of Brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me I front of other customers and very rude. Representing Best Buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, I would fire her in a heart beat. I understand from other employees she is like this quite often. If you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit Best Buy more than you know. 01-16-2017. Thank you.
a great deal for a good product. very compact yet easy to view screen, and user friendly.
Not bad for the price and what it can do. It's decent just for web browsing.
Works like a charm responds very quickly! Just wish it didn't have to be plugged in all the time!
Haven't tried anything but playing music and the radio. Have two Echoes in the house. When I hooked this new one up, the other one came on. Can't quite figure our how to work them separately. May have to go back to Best Buy and ask one of your assistants.
I looked around at multiple e-readers and am so glad I chose the kindle paperwhite. It is very easy to read from and the backlighting still let's me read without having to turn on a light. I greatly enjoy it and certainly recommend it!
My niece was very excited with the use of this product. using it like table and comparing it to an ipad.
Really love the Echo. Have not learned how to use all the features, but really enjoy the ease of getting the music to play.
Fantastic screen, super long battery life, touch screen navigation, e-ink clarity in all lighting conditions, and the vast Amazon content ecosystem. What's not to like? Nothing.
My mother in law loves her kindle!! She plays her games on it and can use it without glasses!
Didn't think I would use it much, due to the my lack of use of Siri. However, this understands most things I ask and is fun for the family. It also doesn't responds to questions discreetly for things that kids could ask. example. Is Santa Real? Answer: I have never met him.
Bought online Black Friday to avoid in store hassles. Got an option on colors to keep my 3 boys from confusing tablets.
I needed to replace my old kindle and this one is perfect even has a camera!
Amazing!Already have the fire stick, but this runs faster, very good!!
I bought this for my mom and she loves it. I would reccommend .
Love it! Use it mostly for music, and it has a great sound. Highly recommend!
I have used this everynight since I bought it to catch all my favorite shows and movies. I am so glad I bought this product!!!!!!
Love my kindle. It's perfect to take with me on the go. Very easy to use.
Works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.
Very cool product.Did have a little difficulties setting up but worth it.Still learning all it has to offer.
We've purchased quite a few of these for our children and nephews and nieces. Works well has reading and games
Great basic features - e-mail, web access, etc. Highly portable
The idea is right but after few weeks, needs restarting else it doesn't respond properly. Compatible devices pairs properly. I used lifx bulbs but it couldn't control them with voice says no device found. Hopefully they will release a software update soon.
It is a common sense thing. It is fun to use. I am going to try the home house stuff but haven't got that far yet
Great for the cook or germ aphobic in your life...hands free...very fun and handy..awesome music
I love how portable this Kindle is. It fits right in my purse and makes it so I can read whenever and wherever I have free time.
This is the second Echo I have purchased. They are amazing from ordering with Amazon, to music, not to mention the new partnership with Control 4 I can operate my entire home automation system now with the echo. This is my best buy of the year....Looking forward to the dots which can go in every room of the house. GREAT JOB!!!!!
laods up quic k i love the voice remote...awesome product
This saved me on my cable bill. Good quality. thanks
Pretty good tablet for the cost, I would highly recommend!
Having fun learning all that Alexa can do. Easy to program, even easier to use.
This a great tablet for the parents who enjoy playing games.
This portable Bluetooth speaker has an excellent sound which can be taken anywhere unlike the Echo and Echo Dot which both have to be plugged in. Want to listen to a favorite song? Just ask Alexa. Want to know the weather report? Just ask Alexa. Want to know your horoscope? Just ask Alexa. A lot of fun and entertainment at a great price. Big things come in small packages!
I love the Echo, I recently bought it for my husband. Until I had to get my own, We love it, I even bought the Echo Dots.
This tablet offers the user more options than a regular tablet but the ease of use a beginner would love
I've had one of these before, but I lost it in the divorce. I happily bought another one. They're so easy to carry around, and setup is trivial.
Great item for someone looking to cut the cord. The selections are endless.
I'm not computer savy but so I like simple things and this was absolutely no problem setting up and using! Best electronic I've every owned :)
Very nice tablet with many new features. Would highly recommend this tablet. My wife is very pleased with it.
I bought this for my daughter. It is our 4th Kindle bought within the family. The touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. In fact, those of us with older model Kindles are jealous.
The resolution is obviously more subtle than my old kindle but the back light is not very even, especially on the bottom. It's a common issue for the new generation.
Great product. Would recommend it to others to buy.
Love it for my boys! We received the 6" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps.
This Kindle is great. I ended up returning it for the simple one, because the light didn't bring that much value for me.
I owned a first generation kindle (that was shaped like a book, with one side wider and heaver to mimic a spine, BTW) when they first came out. Then I owned a kindle 2, which really didn't improve much except on the physical shape and memory. But this one is a huge improvement. Having the back-lit display is completely awesome. I thought I was going to miss a physical keyboard but I definitely don't. If you have a non-backlit kindle, I'd definitely recommend this one. Also, I've played with my friend's Voyager, and I definitely don't think it's worth the extra price for what you get.
I think this is a great ereader, I think even better than the Oasis that just came out. I do like that one but I love that this one seems sturdier and offers the automatic brightness adjustment and the vibration feedback when turning pages. One thing I didnt like was that it was hard to find where the page turn areas were at while reading in the dark. To remedy this, I bought a few aluminum button stickers and put them on the lines of the device
wanted for email/streaming video /audio great price
Purchased as a gift. They absolutely love it! Great for beginners
I love my reader. I love that I can read outdoors, and I can choose the size and the font of the text. I love the new battery life! It is for real. I can go 10 days without a charge; in fact I've never run out of power and had it off the power for 12 days. The only thing I wish, is that it were just a little bit larger. But I love everything else about it. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good reader.
I have two other versions of Kindle tablets and each one gets better. Great screen display allowing for clear and enjoyable viewing. Easy to use. Quick downloading and updating.
Bought one for my mom a few months ago so she could have a bigger screen than her phone . Didn't want to spend too much since they are not big on any kind of electronic. Does the job. Good price for this product. Bought a second one for my dad. Only downfall is I couldn't remove all the pre installed apps on their home screen . Besides that, pretty happy with this tablet.
FireTV with the option for 4K opens the possibility to a new world. Not to mention that the android based software opens the door to use apps beyond the amazon store. if you have a prime account, your experience is greatly enhance. Good wireless connection another plus.
I have a smart tv but the speed with which the apps work leaves a lot to be desired. I bought the Amazon Fire tv because having Amazon prime allows me to watch tons of shows and movies for free and the selection of available apps is great. The only drawback I noticed is that Vudu cannot be installed but I do have that on my smart tv so it's not a big issue. The remote of the Fire tv works via bluetooth so the box can be hidden away and out of sight which is great. Overall, a very solid streaming box.
It has been one of the best purchases ever. It is very simple to use.
I love the Kindle paperwhite reader. I chose the Kindle Amazon Paperwhite because I can read in the sun. We live at the beach and I like to read outside. It is so easy to use. So many books to choose from. Very easy download. Has a lot of great features. It is light weight and easy to take anywhere. Great Product.
You get what you pay for. No complains............
I ordered this as I had already purchased one for myself and I found that my 4 year old son could use it quite easily and loved the games on it. I also has purchased the 2 year no questions asked insurance. I like that I can set time limits, when the device can wake and when it can sleep. How much time should be spent for educational work vs play or movies. I like the heft of it and not having to worry how much it costs in case either of my children decide to throw it across the room. I have a child with autism and learned the hard way that electronic devices can become air borne in a moments notice for no reason at all. So I am no longer willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet.Also, I had purchased a Galaxy Tab 4 and found that I couldn't use Amazon Apps on the secured profile side unless I installed the app on "that" side which would give my children access to purchasing apps. I was not going to do that which rendered any amazon apps useless on the Galaxy Tab 4. I also found that my older son wanted the Amazon apps from the Amazon underground store that my youngest son was playing. When I looked on Google Play for them, those same apps to put on the Tab 4 were $10 a piece!! Being they were Disney apps. Well, this tablet has virtually paid for itself in my opinion and now both my children are happy. I have insurance on both so I am not worried about them breaking them. I don't have to match $10 apps on another device. My children read books and watch movies, or play apps, so the internet isn't really a concern, as it is a little slow but not painful.Overall, I definitely would buy it again and I would recommend it. Very happy with my purchase as it suits my needs.
Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good.
bought this as a gift for my mom send she loves it
I am a huge fan of Alexa and it is because of the dot. The Echo is great also but the size makes it a little bit more intrusive. The only benefit of the Echo over the Dot is the speaker quality. If that is the most important thing for you - then go for the Echo. Otherwise, I would suggest looking at the Dot. The Echo picks up your voice two rooms away. Setting it up couldn't be easier and it links quickly to HUE, VEMO and many other products. Highly recommended.
It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend.
Brought it for my toddler for xmas, so hopefully it works great.
With this amazing toy, you won't need to pay for outrageous monthly cable bills, just buy this and no more cable bills.
This amazon fire 7 tablet is good for web surfing.not so fast but its ok.
Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need.
What I love the most is that I can set the specific time to limit for my little boy to use it, with Kindle Free Time. For example I set up only on weekdays to be used two hours, and 6 hours on weekends. This is really good!
Works as it should and gives us the ability to stream 4K.
Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.
Use this to stream Netflix, hulu, sling TV, and now Vue tv. Ended up canceling sling TV bc Vue tv is better and more channels for less.
We got this mainly so that my husband could listen to music while getting ready for sleep. Really works well.
Purchased this as a gift for a teenage kid as a graduation present. Very pleased with the purchase. The kids love it. Small size, but good speakers. Perfect for the college dorms where he is scheduled to go in a couple of months. Love how the device connects to the cloud and keeps itself updated.
The Paperwhite is very convenient to use outside and inside, small enough to carry and great battery life.
Its great. It has been a lot of fun and its very loud. In fact its so loud that it cannot hear you tell it to stop. Lol
My son is crazy about it,nice size,good grafics,and Internet conection!
Very slow.My 73 year old mother loves it.I would recommend this to a elder or a young child.
I was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. My son usually uses my wife's ipad so I thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. If you buy this tablet, IMMEDIATELY change the settings to require a PIN to make purchases.I think the age recommendation should be 5+ not 3+.
Bought it as birthday gift for my son. He didn't like it at first because he is ise to the Android system. He likes it more now that he's figured it out and for the price it's ok.
Would recommend this to a friend. We are enjoying it a lot.
This is not my first kindle. I wanted one I could read outdoors and it is exactly that. Small, but not too small, it fits easily into your hand and it easy to transport. I am satisfied.
As a speaker it just does the job where it excells is as a home automation controolled
We love our Kindle Fires! One for me, spouse, & 87 year old mother. It keeps us connected just as any more expensive tablet can, and for 1/4 of the cost. Also has Amazon special apps.
Got this at members pricing sale to replace as for. Can't be happerier with quality of sounds
Allows me to watch and read digitally. Great product
Easy to Use, Backlight feature is really nice. Like that you can adjust the font sizes and type.
I held off for quite some time on buying this product being it seemed awful expensive for a tablet with only one purpose. I can now say Im glad I bought it. No more having to worry about reading on a bright sunny day and just in general seems much easier on the eyes.
They loved it and are always talking about their gift .
I bought this device to use to replace an Xbox One (for movies/streaming etc not gaming) - so far streaming movies, using the cloud to upload videos/photos work good. My only issue is getting the device to power back on - there is no "power off" you can put the device to "sleep" but I have had to unplugged it several times to get the unit back online - so far that is my only negative issue
Amazon has a great product with their Kindle Fire tablets. Much more affordable than an Apple IPad. This particular one was purchased on a black Friday sale at an unbelievable price. We are very pleased with this purchase.
Does everything we wanted. Great value for the price.
This is my second Kindle Fire and I have been extremely pleased with them both. This second one is much more versatile, and I love it!
We gave this to our son and his family. It fits right into their small patio and they are happy that our 5 year old granddaughter can play around it. It has endured heat, water bubbles, splash pool and her knocking it over.
Perfect for kids. He has his own tablet, and I can control all access to everything. I don't have to worry about what he's getting into....
Gotta love the character that Echo's Alexa has. She can be snarky from time to time depending on what you ask her. There are a bunch of connectivity features for home automation I have not even been able to touch, yet...I use it for free music streaming by telling her to play a certain genre of music. It's fun to have around! Lots of commands to try out... :)
It is a joy to read. I love the nonglare. The size. Everything about it.
I thought it would do more, eg. be able to integrate with my cell phone to make calls or send text messages
Nice product but does not always respond to voice commands which have to be repeated.
Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...
Parents really like it for a bluetooth speaker and informational guide in their small condo. Great buy!
I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with
The Fire replaces my Kindle reader and serves this purpose well. When using as a tablet with WIFI on, battery runs down very quickly but oh well just need to charge often. Really like the camera. Not the greatest pics but again serves my purposes well.
Have a few issues. Not sure if its my set up in my home automation. Maybe it's just me. But overall, fantastic job by Amazon.
Ok so I tried the free trials for hulu, netflix and amazon. This device allows you to acess them all and many others. But don't expect much to be free. After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things. But the device is made as good as an iphone maybe better I was impressed with the hardware and the boot speed, but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly. When I watch anything on it I make sure everything else that feeds from the modem is offline.
I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features.
Can't complain about a very inexpensive tablet. Got it on black Friday for a great price. Works great
Good value tablet. Better than non brand cheap tablets.
Wife uses it every day and says she loves it. Very happy with the purchase.
This was a gift , was able to talk to an associate and was offered the Amazon tablet at a great price. I'm so thankful for Best Buy and it's knowledgeable sales associates.
Love it!! I can carry it and use it anywhere! I've already purchased 4more as gifts! My family really enjoyed getting them!
My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift!
Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.
Decent choices. Integrates Netflix and voice commands. Sometimes loses wifi connection and has to be reset.
I bought this tablet for xmas gift,( grandson 7 yrs old) had to go back to best buy to get 6 more for the bigger kids. (ages 14 to 26)
So far I am enjoying it and adding other compatible devices with it makes it amazing.
I love to read but books were beginning to take over my space! This little "baby" is so small and holds a lot of books. Not only that, I can upload a new book any time I want to without leaving my house!
I already have an Amazon Echo Show which I love by the way and purchased the Amazon Echo for my mother that was facinated with mine but was afraid of the camera on the Echo Show "Black helicopters". She lives alone and the Echo will help entertain her.
Will recommend this product.Easy to use, fast and efficient
use for travel light in weight makes reading so easy
Had bought the Amazon Tap and then decided to try Echo and feel it's definitely a step up in ease to use and sound.
Amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great
Great tablet for my son. Live the endless library of downloadable books.
Poor choice The product did not work after only one week it froze on me and I was unable to get it to go to the factory reset I would not recommend this product at this time I will call Amazon back to ask for my money and a refund after going on line I see that this is a common problem a problem that they should solve
The product is relatively inexpensive but the performance could be better.
Luckily best buy exchanged the kindle fire for a Lenovo tablet with courtesy and ease. Thank you best buy! It was a black Friday purchase that I did nothing with until late January/ early February. Great way to do business and therefore keep it.
My kids love it their first tablet they pay on it all the time
When I first heard that Amazon had released a budget tablet, I was skeptical on the price that quality would be sacraficed. Boy did I have the wrong assumption, this product has exceeded my expectations and then some. The screen is responsive, the animation on screen is silky smooth when you zoom in on a picture or scroll up and down, it's just all out impressive. Front facing camera too is kind of cool although the quality is not as good as the camera that is in the back. Games play fine on this but you'll be wanting a memory card to store games on it. Games play fine depending on what you install on it but some games suffer minor framerate issues if too much is happening on the screen. Okay for the price, and this should be looked at before purchasing some of the other budget tablets.
Great device that has a long battery life. Gets lots of use.
I bought 2 for my kids for XMAS, the purple and tangerine. The colors were great! The tablets are really nice and they enjoy them. Great camera. The only complaint is some of the games in the play store charge. The same games were free in the google play store.
Wi-Fi works great lots of options for viewing and works quick. Small so fits behind TV and does not need to be indirect site for remote
You have to purchase to many accessories for it to work.
Best tablet for the money Amazon delivers a good product
For under $50 you can read books, watch TV or play an endless assortment of free apps. Battery life is excellent. Great investment!
Good for everyday use. Grandsons wish there could be more free access
I had an Amazon Fire Stick for the house before I bought the Fire TV. I wanted to get rid of cable and just stream. The Fire TV is fast and you barely see any buffer or lag. I had it for about 2 hours and loved it and decided to canceled my cable subscription. Totally worth it with this on my tv now.
It is super quick, alot faster than 2014 version. Alot better video quality imo
Performance up to expectations, but battery life less than expected and advertised. Backlight functions well.
brought it as a gift for my uncle and its a decent tab for the price.
I like it ,it's money well spent. I will recommend it .
I'm in love with my new echo. I own a multitude of wireless Bluetooth speakers that I have used in my garage while working for years. Simply comparing audio quality, I prefer the echo over my UE boom, which was my absolute favorite until this point. It doesn't have quite the bass the boom does, but it makes up for it in clarity, volume and bass responsiveness. Other than being a great speaker on its own, it's a fantastic task companion. The echo is set with every normal task you would ever need, and then some. I would happily buy another if anything were to ever happen to this one.
Great tablet for the price if you are a user of Amazon's services. Plays movies, videos , music from Amazon's Prime service great. If you don't use these, it is an OK android tablet. Does not support the Google Play Store directly but can be sideloaded. Not a great experience tho.
So far this product has worked great. I bought it to replace my kindle charger that was no longer charging my older kindle fire. I bought a new USB cord as well. It charges my kindle so much faster than any of the other chargers I have. I would definitely recommend this product.
I bought my wife a Paperwhite a couple of years ago while I did much of my reading on my iPad. She loved the Paperwhite and I didn't know what I was missing out on. Don't get me wrong, I love my iPad, it's just that it wasn't designed to be only a reader. Now that I have a Paperwhite of my own, reading has become even more enjoyable than it was on my iPad, and I can't think of one negative thing to say about my purchase.
Love the shopping app! Just tell Alexa to add an item and it goes to your phone! You never forget to take your shopping list again
The price and product is perfect. Great for travel. Light weight and easy to use.
We bought this for the son of a family friend. From what we can tell they like it. Not the highest resolution screen and you have to be tied to Amazon services to really enjoy it, but it's definitely a nice functioning tablet.
Daughter loves it. She listens to alot of music on Echo
Very good value for the money. Quad core processor allows for consistent streaming.
Best gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Kids like it a lot.
great tablet, simple to use, just love it.compatible with other amazon products.
Great product for our needs and great value! Bought one for my son and a second for my mom.
Great product and excellent battery life. The backlight is an added bonus that I didn't know I need or wanted until I had.
This was an excellent gift for my wife. She always wanted a standard kindle, but this was one that a few of her friends had. She loves the display and I like that I can sleep beside her when she reads at night. Perfect for someone who doesn't like the phone backlight.
..who is an  fanboy, and now he will more than likely trash this when the HomePod arrives.. yay  ..
Great mini tablet. Clear video. Excellent reading. Very easy to learn.
Does everything its supposed to. My daughter loves it!
I love it. I enjoy playing games and reading on it.
I got this echo for my mother for christmas. She likes asking it things. It has a lot to learn though. Goggle seems smarter
I bought this for my husband as a gift and he loves it. I just wished I would have bought him the next size up.
Easy to teach my Mom how to work. Camera not good.
Had to buy Sims cards for more storage but good choice for kids
Great tablet to keep at work during downtime!! Great value!
ITS PERFECT. I LOVE MY ALEXA. DOES EVERYTHING I WANT IT TO DO
This tablet is nice for the price. Recommended for kids or an adult who doesn't need a large screen.
The paper white is a fantastic e reader with many great features not found on most of the competitors
Pleasant experience, I still love paper books, but you get used to the versatility of the kindle
Can use it for facebook, or email and of course to read my books in a series. Love it.
Tablet works great and you can't beat the price. Will do everything you need it to do and love being able to add extra memory.
I wanted a tablet that would actually work, this also has a good camera
Great product to pull yourself away from cable. Sling app on it for your sports
This is a perfect device for the novice that expects superior performance and doesn't mind paying a little extra. No buffering and excellent 1080 quality.
Ok for a beginner or young person, or someone just learning the technology.
This product is great for children. Easy to use and very inexpensive. Allows for enough storage and very durable!
I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
Come on, $39.99 for a tablet! Value, value, value.
Very easy to use and to set up. All you need is a tv.
my 6 year old granddaughter loves her new tablet. she uses it to play games and download movies.
Has great sound and base. Responds correctly to all my wuestions
This product is fast a stylish. Good battery life. Helps to be a regular Amazon client.
This is a great tablet for any user. The picture is beautiful and it is easy to navigate. It is compact and lightweight and simply elegant.
It does everything I need it to do, but the battery life is short lived. I bought it with the intentions to keep my toddler entertained. The battery last about 4 hours, if it runs continuously. If it is intermittent use it lasts about 12 hours. Worth it for the price.
Was gift fot my daughter. she seems to enjoy very much.
Easy to use. Easy to read in any light. The battery last a long time.
Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them.
5 star product would recommend it to anyone who is looking to get rid of cable
Got it for my future mother in law as a christmas gift she is enjoying being able to read books online
If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.
I bought this speaker for my nephew , he is 25 and he loved it. It is a great speaker. It can understand most commands. Sound quality is very good. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a rechargeable battery. It has to be plugged in all the time , no battery.
This it's a great tablet for kids it does a good kid and keep them busy
I put a memory card in this and put the Play Store on it (Google it). I use it as a mini office with a Bluetooth keyboard. I love it.
This one was for my baby, and she is happy as a kid with a new toy. I have my own tab so not familiar with fire yet. But was a good deal.
It's a perfect gift and has way more than I expected it to have.
Great tablet so far. I bought it as a gift andhave heard no complaints
As expected, light and easy to carry around. Also easy to order books with an Amazon account
Got it for my son. He loves everything about it & likes that it even fits in most of his jean pockets.
I had one of the older kindles but decided to buy this one because you can read in the dark. What a great decision!!! Recommend to anyone that enjoys reading.
This thing lets you watch practically anything you want to. Well worth the money
I love my Echos. I'm a 75 year old widow and I have 2 Echos and 3 Dots in various rooms. I can listen to audio books in the kitchen when I'm cooking and eating or in the laundry room. I play Jeopardy and listen to Country and Western music. At night when I'm trying to doze off, I tell Alexa to play music to help me relax and go to sleep. I tell her to wake me up at a certain time and then I ask what's on my calendar for that day.
My nieces and nephews love it. Even my 40 yrs old cousin got one and he is thrilled about it. Really easy to use.
Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books.
It's great, tons of functionality and the first step in cutting the satellite/cable cord!
Great for using at home as an alarm and finding things
Bright backlight- amazing controls + Kindle features
I bought it for college textbooks but took it back because it didn't work for this particular device.
It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright
Great device for the price, got it in a reasonable amount of time.
Easy set up. Easy to use. Hdmi cord right into the tv or sound system. And you are up and running.
Bought this for my girlfriend for a replacement for her old kindle. Easy to set up. She likes that it is slim. she loves it.
I bought it as a gift for my grandfather, from what I can tell he really seems to enjoy it.
This is a great toy for now I am just learning the infinite number of things I can do with Echo.
I had the dot, but it wasn’t loud enough. I’ve used my sister’s and fell in love with this one. She has the black one, so I got the white one & I love it. It blends in and works great.
I bought the Fire for a second tv as I already have one and like it. I bought the Fire because I am a Prime member.
The paper white does what it claims it will do.You can go for weeks on end w/ only a single charge and it still have juice. Reading and import documents such as per files are simple via "drag-n-drop" in the root folder (which you'll create), documents. I only which that the ability to read .doc .docx files were available rather than having to convert files to pdf format. The screen is gentle to the eyes to read, whether outside in the sun or a low light setting, backlight or not.
Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone
Bought this as a gift for a wedding and the couple could not be any happier. Very easy to use and fun to experiment with.
This is my first "e-reader" i couldnt be happier!!
It has a timer for kids when you set the time you want it on and the off
I love this, it is absolutely perfect for all my online needs
I bought two kindles one for my daughter and one for my god daughter and I love it. I can let them use it and they can download whatever they want for free such as books and kid friendly games. I don't have to worry. It can also be used like a normal tablet.
Amazon Echo is the best voice command device for everyone in the family
The reason people give it 5 stars is because they don't give the product enough time before they review it. I purchased this along with my kindle dx on August 12, 2010. I can honestly say that I don't recommend this product as it will damage the kindle. The hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack. To avoid this, you have to make sure the kindle doesn't rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further. This is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesn't know better. One thing I can honestly say is that I really wanted to like this product. I really wanted it to work. I'm looking for a slip cover now.
We have iPads and a surface, but my wife wanted something to read on. This fit the ticket perfectly. We haven't had any problems with it in the first 90 days. Everything works great.
Does what it is supposed to do!
The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast.
Easy to setup and use. I gave this as a gift to a 13 year old. % minutes later, she and the books loaded and started to read.
. Works great. Super fast loading opposed to the firestick and rokus. I love it, one of the best quad processor TV boxes out there.
Easy to use and setup. Great option to have for kids. Netflix, Disney Jr, PBSkids all are available for download.
Now I will admit I am a tech gal. I did do some investigations before buying. I was not dissapointed at all. This is like your own personal assistant. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, spell,set alarm,check weather,traffic,news update,even tells jokes. I love the fact that anyone can talk to it and it will still work. My family and friends have pure entertainment with this neat gadget. I look forward to seeing more things added to the commands. Also was super easy to set up and the volume is way better than expected.
I bought this for my child who is very hard on things. She loves it.
Works as intended. Speaker could perform better, but still give 5 stars as it's not designed to just be a speaker but a voice activated assistant, which it does very well.
Its a quick fast little tablet. Can do a lot of stuff a normal tablet does.
This tablet was purchased for my son and was a great gift. Very kid friendly offering child safety options. Great price.
Got this to replace a fire stick. It stands without buffering and I love the voice remote.
The best product we have been pleasantly surprised
Love this set up. More movies and TV than I can watch.
Listens to my every word and isn't insulted when i tell her she is dumb as a stone!
I bought this tablet for my son so he could have something to entertain him on our road trips. It works great. I love the child-proof case that it comes with. My only complaint is that the interface is slow sometimes. I'm honestly not surprised though, because it runs off of Android. I typically avoid Android but I figured I would give it a shot. After using this tablet, I think I will avoid using Android products again. Besides the slowness of the Android OS, it is still a great tablet.
I bought the Amazon Fire TV about a month ago. I reviewed the Roku, Apple TV and Chromecast. This one was rated the highest and i haven't been disappointed. I also have the Apple TV. It was more and difficult to operate for my wife.
Brought Alexa home turn her on and immediately she linked to all the smart devices inside my home. I think we were up and running in about 10 minutes. I couldn't be more pleased.
The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7.
A bargain for the price especially for the coverage of the warranty. A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter. Things can happen to it. She absolutely loves it and pretty easy to use!
Best price cant complaint, super fast really responsive and if you have an amazon prime account the best.
An excellent tablet at a low cost. It more than met my expectations for basic use such as video watching and gaming.
Love it, great quality. Nice picture, so good. !!!!
After experimenting for several months with an Echo Dot, I decided to take the plunge when the Echo showed up online at a deep discount. Like the Dot, setup was easy. Sound quality is awesome. Sometimes it works too good as it listens to everything all the time. It’s going to be fun to use just the same.
It's a great kindle for the price. Eyes don't get tired from reading it
A very nice and very helpful tablet. I always bring it with me And it helps a lot with my art career
Very simple setup. Within minutes I was using and discovering some fun entertainment. I am not an Amazon Prime member yet, but I expect being a member will open even more wonderful entertainment.
Bought this as a replacement for her Samsung tab 3 that was no longer holding a charge....seemed at first to not like it so much but has grown on her since using for her educational activities and some games from the Amazon app....asked daughter if she liked the fire and she said yeah pretty well
A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.
Bought this for my daughter after her old one was broken when it got folded up in the sofa bed. Don't ask. Lol. She loves it! Light weight. Holds a charge for a long time. Easy to use.
Already purchased fire stick but wanted a box with a little more capability. The android boxes were priced over $200. This box is dual wifi band plus has ethernet. Runs great with no issues. Would recommend
It's the perfect tablet for a the price, does everything a more expensive tablet does.
Son reports it work FANTASTICLY at UC IRVINE.Displays PDFs quite well.Fewer non- school distractions than other tablets.
I own many tablets but for 40 bucks this was a no brainer. Great buy.
After the initial trial questions found our Alexa's vocabulary is minimum and does not respond most of the time.
The Kindle Fire is great for trips. The airplane mode is easy to find and it's nice having access to amazon prime video.
The Echo is a great device to have around the house. Ask questions & Alexa answers.
Amazon echo is simply an amazing product. I was able to set it up in minutes. In addition to all of the normal stuff you see on TV commercials it also integrates well with with all of my existing gadgets (Nest thermostats, Rachio sprinklers, Fitbit, Security system, Harmony remote hub, etc through IFTTT. My wife loves watering her flowers outside just by asking Alexa. The only thing I am really mad about is that it's now $20 than I bought it from Best Buy 4 days ago.
For the price I think this was a "Best Buy" it made for a great Christmas gift
Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet 16GB has been easy for me to learn how to use. I like that I can read free books from the library. It has everything I wanted and is a nice size for holding.
great product Amazon does a real good job giving you big bang for your buck the tablet is rapid and battery life is good
First time I have ever used a Kindle Fire and I wasn't disappointed. It is very good tablet. The only downside is that there aren't that many apps like the Google store has.
It was nice to have an extensive library at my fingertips.
I bought as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old and she loves it. It works great and my package arrived early with no issues.
I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
This remote is especially good for those who eyesight is weaker, due to aging. I got it as a gift for someone, and it makes searching for channels easier for the elderly.
This is a great eBook reader around the house & free WiFi areas ( some McDs, Starbucks, etc. ).Got this as: 1. It's 50 Bucks.2. Doesn't hurt so much if you fall asleep while reading ( doesn't weigh as much as a "full-size" tablet ) 3. Fits in my pants pocket so you can take it with you.4. Lots of free books from Amazon.5. Did I mention it's $50.00?
My family and business love this device. It's easy for the kids to use. Instantly provides music for our work day.
Love the Kindle! Will allow me to travel with my favorite books all in one place
I used to read books off my iPad but I love the Kindle so much more. Easier on my eyes, easier to take with me when I travel, overall so much better for reading!
Got this as a gift for my wife after she just about wore out her old Kindle. She only wants it to read so it didn't make sense to get the other versions. This one does exactly what she wants and she can use it to read anywhere, indoors or outside.
The technology just keeps getting better and better
Prefect for all reading conditions and environments. I take it everywhere.
Excellent tablet for 50, works very well, surprise me when found it have bluethoot to connect with my sound dock.
This kindle is an upgrade from the older model I have. It's a slimmer design with a nice purple color.
Great device. Amazon is the way to go! Great quality of shows!
Got it for my daughters birthday. We all enjoyed the echo. Thinking of getting another for myself.
I love the Amazon Fire. It's very similar to other tablets without the heavy price tag.
Purchased for kids. It is easy for them to use it. They love the apps. Great parental controls.
I ended up buying the Echo on sale. I was thrilled once Alexa was set up, which by the way is easy. I just bought another one on sale and gave it as a gift. A must have for sure if you like technology, Alexa is helpful and a lot of fun.
Bought for work I just use the wi fi and get music all day long. Plenty loud enough. $$ well spent.
Easy to use and easy to order books. Now I just have to join amazon prime for the lending library and look into the books i haven't read but want to.
I did some looking in the web and after looking at many tablets this was the best choice.
Bought this one for my daughter for Christmas, but I have one and like it very much.
It is an amazon amazing among many things that can be used by many people and always will be a good product to use for many people to tryout and have an important experience for their family. Amazon Kindle fire 16gb with side that has slot for the extra memory in the form of a memory chip.
I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.
Cheap but ok processor. $50 is an excellent deal. Response from touchscreen not great as iPad but price reflected.
Bought one for my wife and my daughter who is in college. They both love them. easy to use, great screen and endless choices of material to read.
Good age appropriate learning tool for kids. There is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored. Overall a good tablet for the kids.
I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions.
I like it. I use it everyday and so far no cons. Im very please.
Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire
You get what you pay for. The camera is terrible but I bought it for games and reading. The ads can get annoying but for what I paid for its a good product
Great tablet for my daughter. Does everything she needs to do with it and easy set up. She loves it. Might be the best present she got for Christmas this year.
Great device that simplifies many things. Mostly understands what I say even without training it.
Bought this for easier reading and it meets my expectations. Great display fidelity.
I liked the ease of use and how quickly we could get it set up and is great for kids to use as well
Was attracted by the low price and bought this item spontaneously when strolling at a BestBuy store - perfect ereader / tablet, although an e-ink screen type is more pleasant for your eyes. Nevertheless for short readings it is OK.
I love my echo. Wonderful entertainment as well as other uses. I have a light linked to the echo. Was easy to set up. Eventually I will add the thermostat. Not large good sound and voice recognition.
Amazon Fire tv is the best "smart tv box" available. The box is now 4K video capable and uses the android operating system. Plenty of apps already installed and tons more available. Setup was simple and the menus are a breeze to navigate, especially with voice search.
Love this tablet! It's easy to setup and the pre-loaded games were a hit with my little one! Very pleased with the the selection of videos and games on Amazon Kid Play :)
Use it every day for news weather, music, alarm clock.
I love it good bye Apple TV and Roku. A must have for the digital age..!
This kindle is fast and affordable. I highly recommend it.
Really enjoyed this product, books, music, weather, news at my finger tip. A big part of my life. I use at on the train, on my breaks at work, at home.
I love my kindle for reading over my iPad now. Best buy gave me a good deal on this kindle, and fast and friendly service. This kindle is easy on my sensitive eyes and a pleasure to hold. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an e-reader.
Started with two Dots but decided buy this for the living room. Great sound and fun to use.
Currently this is the fifth version of the Kindle Fire that I purchased since they came out. Purchased this one due to its ability to maximize storage with a SD card unlike the other ones I have. It seemed to not run as smooth as my Kindle Fire HDX once I started adding apps to it which is not a problem for me since I use other tablets for that. This was mainly purchased to download shows and movies from Amazon Prime to watch offline.
I heard about the Kindle from a friend . So when the BB clerk told me about the Kindle Fire, I decided to buy one. I am very happy that I did. Now whenever something comes up on TV that I don't understand, my Kindle Fire finds the info very quickly.
Great starter tablet without the big cost. Does everything I need.
I couldn't pass up this"deaL of the day" - a tablet for under $35! The Fire is a great basic tablet. I wish the sound was better but that can be addressed via a Bluetooth speaker.
Fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7".
Had the amazon dot but wanted the echo. Way better sound quality and responds much quicker. Very pleased with this purchase
I wanted to have something that I could use outside and not get a reflection or eyestrain from. I found the set-up a little clunky but overall I am very satisfied with the Paperwhite.
bought for my 4 year old daughter. plenty of apps and battery life is solid.
Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games
This is a great tables for browsing the net, reading or listening to music. However when moving to video apps like YouTube, crunchyroll (to name a few) the video will either not play or the app won't show on the home screen. You have to do with videos provided by Bing.
This product did not disappoint me. I purchased it on the deal of the day and do not regret it for a second. Great sound quality and unbelievably accurate with voice commands.
Great and fun to use. I like the music link up and news
This Amazon Fire TV box and remote is a great option to save money, and eliminate long term cable subscriptions. I should have purchased this years ago...
Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
bought this for my wife she loves the fact she can now expand the memory to 128 gig
I initially purchased Nvidia Shield TV but returned it in favor of Fire TV. The driving factor was the apps and it has everything you need.
Now I don't have to feel guilty bringing my Kindle to work,he can play his games and watch his videos.
Allowed me to cut my satellite service and save $100 a month. No worrying about commercials or missing shows.
Picked this up for a spare tablet, and at $49 it was a no brainer. Videos, games, books, music work great. lots of capabilities. Screen looks great and it does feel a lot sturdier as it was a more expensive tablet. if you can't find an app, you can install Google Play store (have to search for it online for instructions). I did return this tablet as we specifically bought this to be use while on the treadmill, and you can't access Bravo or E! Tv. They only make apps for iOS (iPad/iPod/iPhone) other than that...its not a problem with Amazon or their tablet, I blame it on Bravo.Excellent tablet otherwise.. I will definitely buy it again in the future. Just don't need it at this moment.
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
My sister in law is in love with this. Best gift ever for her
Outstanding! We Love everything about it and look forward to what comes next!
Bought the fire box for main Television in house and it works great
Alexa Was my Mother's Day present and she now resides on our island in the kitchen. She is used for a timer for all the kids and they have even set multiple timers. Alexa is also set up to our living room lights and also our Nest Thermostat. Alexa can also tell you an unlimited amount of jokes, the kids start the day off with a joke.
I love having Alexa. We have 3 echo and one dot. Love that I turn off my lights.
Excellent improvement over my first kindle which was the original. Love the backlight for reading at night.
I had to buy this item due to the store no longer having the Firestick in the store. Set up was easy and dry easy to use.
I bought this because I recently signed up for Amazon Prime and wanted to take advantage of the free books. Nice tablet.
I've been utilizing the Fire 7 for several tasks includeing email, Web searches, & control of my swimming pool equipment controls. Would recommend the Tablet to others.
Amazon really hit the ball out of the park with this one, the Echo is great!
Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend.
Great for playing music and keeping lists. Have not tried all the fancy reorder item feature, but Alexa's features keep expanding, so the possibilities are constantly expanding.
Very easy to use set up was really use I love all of the channels
I bought the 7" Amazon fire tablet for my 3 year daughter to view learning programs and videos. I love it because you can have up to 5 children and 2 adults sign up And create the parental controls level for each of them
I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations
I originally got the Amazon Tap. I had read the reviews that mentioned that the sound was hollow with no bottom. That was correct. I returned it got the Echo and there is a big difference. The only problem is that it does not have portable power pack. I have seen 3rd party source and I'm gonna try it.I highly recommend this item. It is all that it claims.
this is just as good as a laptop of ipad why waste money on something expensive get this
This is a wonderful device especially for the beginner, my 70 year old mother. Step-by-step setup instructions are easy to follow, and the price is phenomenal for the features it has
This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.
This device is amazing. It has all the latest tv apps as well as cable channel apps. It definitely will cut your cable bill in half
Very easy setup and connectivity to my accounts, including ebooks and video. Primarily used as ereader - so far like the one-handed use and haven't noticed glare as a problem.
It was an okay purchase for my 6 year old. I definitely wouldn't pouches it for myself. Not much you can do on it.
My daughter loves this and.enjoys the free books on AmaZon
This is so fun to use for the whole family. We ask it so many questions and play music all the time.
My 7 year old daughter loves this tablet for games and watching Netflix and Hulu. Great size for her. I like the parental controls and easy to monitor her activity and how much time a day she can use it.
I bought 6 of them. They made very good christmas gifts..
So far so good seem like a good tablet for general stuff
I love the kindal because i am a reader. i able to check out books from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app's and get the latest headline. Great price.
I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.
I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use
I purchased this for my 4 and 2 year old grandchildren. They were using parents phones and running the battery down. Now they have their own device and can watch their cartoons and play games. Love the case, it makes it easy for little hands to hold on to. Overall very good purchase.
I love my new kindle! Purchased on sale for $39.99 which was a great value. Light, compact & super easy to use. A big plus for me was that with this version you can add more memory.
Ny son really enjoys playing his games on his tablet. It was good purchase at a awesome price.
This is my first E-Reader but I have numerous mobile devices and I can say without hesitation that this reader is awesome. It's just like reading a book. I have no complaints, fits my needs perfectly. Very pleased with my purchase.
It is great tablet for the price. The only downside it is a little slow at times.
Had a good experience where I was would def go again
My daughter loves to read so we thought that a Fire would be a great option for her. She loves it. They are getting smaller as time goes on for sure but still just as durable. Great gift!
Great cheap tablet. Even better after you side load the Google Play Store.
Alexa is the easy winner in every regard compared to Google Home. Echo can operate as a Bluetooth speaker, Home requires you stream their apps. Apple Music on Home, no sir. Audible on Home, also no.
A real nice tablet for children and got it on sale at Bestbuy
It works! It's a plug, what more can I say
Great tablet. I use it to read only. Bought an additional 32g memory and its great
Bought two as gift to kids. They love it very much
I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
I absolutely love this little device. I grabbed the audio adapter for it and use it constantly. It works well to say the least.
ok feature. Operating instructions easy.Alexa feature is plus
Have to have to charge the book.
It is easy to use and has many apps. I would recommend
Bought for my son since he kept stealing mine........
Love this tablet. It's perfect for kids, teens, and adults. I have 5 in my home. We all love them. Perfect for searching the Internet, playing games, keeping up with the news and TV shows you love. It connects right to my fire stick and I watch movies without hooking up all kinds of cables. Could not believe the price. Best bargain on a quality tablet. Thanks Best Buy!!
Good tablet for kids and easy to use. Great for everyone
Data is tied to skills and should just be a blanket open forum of knowledge. Still has other benefits to explore.
Love this reader. I recently flew to Texas. My reader made the trip relaxing and a lot more bearable. I love the ease of use. This device is so much better than a pad for readers. You can tuck it in a pocket or purse easily.
Works great for educational games and videos for my 4 & 7yr old
Very handy. No more need to buy books. Keep this next to your bed.
Purchased 5 of these for my grandkids ages from 4-9. They were all able to work the tablet easily.
Have wanted some type of Kindle for quite a while, especially for reading the many free non-fiction history books I've downloaded for my genealological research. Couldn't pass up the sale price on this model and it is everything I hoped for.
Got this included in a package deal with our Harmony Elite a few months back, and it has served as a decent add-on accessory throughout our home. We mainly use it as a bluetooth speaker for our mobile devices since the Amazon Prime Music library is pretty sparse, and Alexa isn't nearly as advanced as Siri in terms of answering questions. However, I was able to create a rule using Amazon's API that allowed me to link Google search. Alexa is also inconsistent with performing smart home tasks, but I'm sure this will improve over time. I wouldn't pay full price for this device, but I would recommend if you can find it on sale.
Easy inexpensive gift that you can rely on. Although i would rather have the Google play store as the main download application, it's Worth the money to buy for others.
Good price works great would buy again good value for the price
Great addition to the house from everything for playing music on demand a timer ocean sounds at night and the skills are always expanding well worth the purchase
This is the best device for watching Netflix content.
Over all, my grandchildren are happy with their tablets.
I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost.
Love the Kindle Paperwhite. So convenient to take everywhere. Especially to the beach!
I bought for my mother for a gift and she lI've it
The perfect Christmas gift. Now my family all has one.
Hassel free easy set up and use. Great price with superior performance.
We enjoy this product more than our roku device. It works great.
I love this tablet for kids .. it's so much fun for them .. great buy ...
The box was well protected and shipping was on time, very satified
According to the info, the Paperwhite charges faster with the charger made for a Kindle but I think any brand will work. It came in a package deal when I bought my Paperwhite otherwise I would've skipped it used what I've been using for my old Kindle. I gave it 4 stars, because I like it, but feel it's overpriced.
Pros:I got this Kindle for my son to use while traveling. The backlight feature is good for reading at dark places. The device has great battery life as well.Cons:Not as thins as the latest Kindle Voyage. The screen response is just a tad bit slow. Some of the children's e-books on Amazon are not compatible with this device.
Just like the title...fast and perfect together with amazon prime (you don't need to have amazon prime to use this player)
It work great the first time and just bought my 2nd for a different location. The cord is that much closer to being cut.
Good tablet so far. My kids have really enjoyed it and have not put down since they got it.
This is a nice tablet for children or beginners. Processing speed is adequate for playing games or watching videos.
Love it, even though I don't have a lot of other smart products that alexa is compatible with.
Giving these out as gifts this holiday season and couldn't be happier!! Great price point, perfect size and easy to enjoy for anyone in the family!
Pretty good Will recommend it to friends and family
It seems Alexa doesn't really do anything for free. Haha. You have to subscribe to just about everything. I tried it for a couple of days and returned it.
I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more
These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well.
Better processor than the fire stick and has Ethernet port which is always good.
simple and easy to operate; very fun to work with for business or leisure
This is a wonderful streaming box. It was easy to set up. There has been no lag and it provides channels I cannot get on my Apple TV. I absolutely love it.
I have owned the Echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides. Although the Tap doesn't have the hands free feature of the Echo I like its portability. I'm able to take it outdoors at home and using the WiFi play music or even use the other features available by just asking Alexa. The unit is well built and I really like the charging cradle provided.
I purchased this tablet as a Christmas present when they were having a sale. It's a good, basic tablet that does everything you could want a tablet to do (especially for the price I paid).
The Amazon Fire 7 Tablet 16GB is very a good value... highly recommend.
I don't use it myself, but it's my wife's favorite kindle ever. She loves the backlight. Easy on the eyes, but easy in the dark.
Got this for my son. It's not top quality but for $50 it's not bad
Able to read in all types of light- great reader for on the go and on the road
Amazon tablet great gift, love the 6 pack gift idea
I have bought this tablet for my other 2 grandaughters and it works fine for them! This one is for the 5 year old ! The other 2 are 7 and 3 years old! Great parental control features!
Wished it integrated with Google Play Music. Torn betwee Google Home and Echo because of this. But if you have wemo smart home like us. It works really well. Half our switches and plugs are wemo controlled. "Alexa turn off all lights." Really works! Google Home currently doesn't support Wemo.
you just cant beat the value here. great having one of these
Nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. Something for all ages and very simple - my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. The hard rubber cover is a great extra - I had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over $30 for something that sturdy and protective. Excellent Product..
I brought this tablet in December of 2016 for my mother. She uses it regularly now for streaming videos and reading emails. The camera quality is horrible. I would suggest buying another tablet if you want decent pictures. Also, consider that many of the Amazon tablets come with ads as screensavers. To avoid those ads, you can typically pay a one time fee or buy the exact same version for a higher price. Looking back now, I definitely would have given this to my baby brother and brought my mother the newer fire tablet with a bigger screen.
Bought this as a gift. Does everything the recipient needed. All features listed were adequate.
I needed a 2nd tablet and this was a great purchase.
This tablet is really great for someone who wants a standard tablet experience. Nothing too flashy, but more than gets the job done.
I got this because I love to read. Lots of books on it. I really love the battery life on it. I can go a week with one charge on it. No complaints except now I got to find time to read all the books on it
Echo will read a book, play music, tell me a joke and work remotely to turn on a light at home while I'm out of the house.
I bought this for my husband to replace his original Kindle. The lighted background and light weight makes it perfect for reading in bed. The added features of Internet and numerous apps make it perfect for so many uses. It is easy to manage and the grandkids also love using it for the games. It has a great camera, too! Overall very pleased.
Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price.
Love my new Kindle. It was time to replace my old one. Everything is so much bet
Just what I needed
She is loving being able to play all the games that we can download. Easy to use and the perfect size.
Durable , worth every penny, got it for our 2 year old daughter , amazed how easily she can navigate it
This tablet is awesome and for an awesome price. It replaced my laptop so much more convenient and easier to carry.
But, this isn't a bad substitute. The print and light are easily adjustable. It's small and lightweight, easy to carry and holds a charge for a week or so. At the font size I use it takes 2 to 3 kindle page turns to equal 1 page turn of a book and thus I think I would prefer a larger screen. Although it's touted as better for the eyes than reading using the kindle app on a tablet, I really don't think that is the case for me. For me a tablet is just as usable although heavier and less convenient. Overall , for the price, the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend it.
well it was what i expected easy to download books ............... good price
Got this for my kids they wont put it down but can be confusing with setup
It was everything I wanted and the salesman said it would be.
I already have Apple TV, but bought the Fire TV, since it's so highly rated, for another room. So glad I did, because it's worked out GREAT for less money than the Apple TV.
It's a charger, what else can I say.
Love this tablet. I am not a computer... tablet geek and so I love how easy to use. I have 2 kindle fires, one for everything on a secure connection at home and one kindle (this one) that I travel with. I am not sure of security when I travel so I use this kindle when I travel for information -- google map, entertainment --youtube, games, ect.
One of the best TV boxes on the market hands down.
Greta screen and a great price. Easy to work with either using the Amazon book service or side loading.
Not the paperwhite, but for the price I paid works great for my kids to carry around multiple books they need to read for school
I really love the kindle. Great for the price. And u can add a memory card for more storage.
I bought the Amazon Fire TV to mod and stream media. It works fantastic and does exactly what I want including 4k video output. The primary reason I chose this item over the Fire stick was that I wanted wired ethernet and not wireless. Picture quality and sound is excellent.
Great for family time. HD is awesome. Great product
This tablet was purchased for a 10 year old but anyone could benefit from it. Very easy to use. Processing speed is good for a bargain tablet. Battery lasts a long time. Overall a great starter tablet.
Doesn't answer as many questions as led to believe should have google instead of Bing a simple alarm clock is all I use it for not much good for anything else would have returned it but I like gadgets . Don't recommend purchasing
I love my Amazon tv box! I love that I can plug an Ethernet cable directly into it. I love that my movies don't buffer. And I love Alexa, she does so much.
My two daughters really enjoy using their Fire tablet. It is really easy to use, sturdy, high definition, has tons of awesome apps integrated for children. My girls were Apple users, yet it was easy to transition.
I love my kindle. Silk is a fast and easy way to access the webI can read books on my kindle anywhere once I download them to my kindle. I have over 300 books on the Cloud. It holds a charge for days when idle. Downside. Hard to read outside due to glare
The kindle fire kids is perfect size for our toddler, case is super durable, and I love how it can set up age appropriate as our child grows
I'd been looking for a decent table radio for a very long time. Best Buy had a Deal-of-the-Day on these and I thought, what the heck, here's a table radio you can talk to. It does a whole lot more than that, and there is quite a learning curve, not so much in how to use it, but to learn what all is available for it and then how to make that functionality useful. The sound quality is easily that of a good table radio and aside from telling it to play a radio station I can play tons of stuff from Prime Music online and add skills whenever I need them from the skills store. (All the skills I've seen so far are free so "store" is kind of a loose term.) It responds to your voice immediately and is easier to use than Siri or Cortana. With all the alarms, timers, shipment trackers, wall street reports, entertainment updates, etc, it's like living with a gifted, less snooty concierge. I like it and would buy another if this one ever broke.
I wasn't sure I should buy it because I thought it would be a cheaply made tablet for $50 but I was wrong. I LOVE IT. It's worth it
Bought for my kids for Christmas and they both love them. Bought one for each kid.
originally had a 4g and needed a larger one for my nephew to play games and this is perfect for a 5 year old.
My nephew is going to college next year and we want to give him a gift. Kindle suits it well for him to learn and study.
Can't recommend the Fire TV enough. This is the best media player on the market, and we've compared it to Roku and Chromecast. We use it more than our Smart TV's apps. Also works pretty well with Playstation Vue if you're using it for TV.
Great product. Able to connect a lot of different devices.
Great for the person who loves technology and the sound of their own voice command. Price is right too.
Super easy to use. Love how it's voice activated so it is convenient
With a 300+ book library, I'm an avid reader. But when you're teaching a 1200-page behemoth, carting it around becomes a bit of a burden. With the Kindle, it weighs almost nothing. Plus with the Paperwhite, I can read when the wife goes to sleep without getting kicked out because of lamplight! Love it
Purchase this tablet for my niece and I must say it's a best product in this range.
This is my first e-reader, and I generally like it. I've been using it for a couple of months on weekends, and haven't yet needed to charge it since the first time after buying it.The lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. The text is crisp and easy to read. I'm very accustomed to using 8+ inch tablets, so a 6" screen feels a little small, but it if sufficient when you are just reading, and not looking for new books.
this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.
The charger don't fit in the tablet I called Amazon
Paper white is worth every penny! I was upgrading from the regular kindle to this and noticed that my eyes are more relaxed...
I'm really happy with my Kindle Fire! It's easy to use and has so many features…don't know why I waited so long to get one :)
I have an Amazon ECHO and the Fire TV integrates nicely with the ECHO. The Amazon TV is faster than the FIRE STICK as it has memory to buffer streaming video and present it in what appears to be real time
Bought for our 6 year old. Great parental controls allow you to keep track and monitor use. Would recommend for others to get for their children
Kindle fire is a good product. I am happy with my purchase. The only difficulty was buying books. It was difficult to understand initially.
Gave this as a gift, and I have to say, it does everything he wants a tablet to do. Win win!
Was considering the HD version, but realized the specs weren't very different. A good tablet for the price paid.
Very happy with my purchase
I had an old Sony e-reader that I loved but it wasn't working too well anymore. I decided that a Kindle was the only viable replacement on the market right now. (Looked at Kobo also). So far, I like it. Great screen, backlight on mine doesn't have the problems that others have complained about.
This was a gift for the wife, we have had kindled since the original and this is just a book lovers dream
I find this product is far better Han Apple TV. Otis easy to use the controls are smooth and it's extremely compact.
I absolutely LOVE my kindle. I go nowhere without it. It has kept me entertained for hours. Don't have to keep up with books that get torn or lost. I would and DO RECOMMEND a kindle for EVERYONE
I bought this Kindle to replace my original Kindle that stopped working when I dropped it. I like that the screen is lit so that I can read it in the dark. One problem is that some games that I had purchased for my original Kindle won't load to this one. I use it mainly for reading, and it works well for that . It is small enough that I can take it with me without being too small to read.
Size is a little small and hard to type because characters are close together. Charge cord is positional so it is difficult to play with it while charging and cord is very short.The price is very good and it works well. I like the Amazon store and added benefit of Amazon coins
Basically it does everything that adult Amazon tablet does
Wanted a easy reading for outdoors. Close this based on reviews. Did not need to replace my iPad with the more expensive Fire tablet. Would have given it a 5 star but amazon packages them with out a charger adapter.
I like this 7" tablet. It is a little slow starting up, but cost and display are very good. It is compact enough to take with you. Battery seems good so far.I put on a few games for the grandkids. I am glad I purchased this tablet.
Great as a streaming music ayer that has other functions. The quality itself of the speaker is great.
I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin, you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games, music, and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product.
It is easy to use and has a lot of great features. It has a fairly decent camera. It is a good size
works for what needed, watching netfix app is done
Great tablet all around. Good for kids for the parental control options.
Got this as a Christmas gift for my father. So far (it's Feb now) he loves it and enjoys having Alexa tell him the news or the weather. Easy to set up and nice to be able to have music on demand without having to open any apps or turn anything on.
WE LOVE OUR Amazon Echo,works great.I play a lot of music on it.
Got this for my son so he could use it with Alexa. It's great
I bought my wife the fire when they first came out a couple of years ago. She found it difficult to use and passed it onto our youngest son. He showed her all the features and when the latest fire came out, he bought one, showed us all it had to offer, she bought me one for Father's Day, and then she bought herself one. My son helped us set it up and showed us how to use all the featured it offered. We love it. We take it everywhere, especially in our travels. It is offered at a great price and I purchased two more for Christmas gifts along with the cases...Love them.
My daughter loves her kindle. I swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her
My son loves it he downloads games and music... he watches movies on it he loves it.
Alexa is fun but not able to be customized to play your favorite song or tell wife hello hubby loves you
Its good product with the $ amount. I feel its little slow but okay.
Bought this as a christmas gift for a family member, I've heard nothing but good things about it. Great little tablet for a great price.
My grandkids wanted this for obvious reasons and when I saw it go on sale on BB, I jumped at the chance and bought it. The kids love it.
This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
I love my Echo; the technology is user friendly & helps with everyday items. It is great to check the weather with just a few voice commands or listen to my favorite radio station.
Excelente !!
Bought for my Grandson for Christmas. He loves it. Glad I went with the 16GB,Thanks to the advice of BEST Buy employee.
I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it.
Bought this for my 7 year old daughter. Great first tablet for a child.
I assumed this item would have a cord with the plug. Never assume. It was the plug only. The cord on my 7" Kindle is very short so I bought a 4 foot cord also. Now I keep the shorter cord with me so I can charge on the go, the longer cord and new plug are what I use at home. Satisfied
This product is great for all members in the family. . My kids ask questions about homework, my husband loves the radio and I love the the current news.
Works perfectly with my new Kindel
This is my 4th Fire tablet. They're so affordable, I buy them and end up giving them away to family members.
I bought this as a gift and my nephew really enjoys it.
Haven't been able to train Alexa like we've heard. Probably our own fault. We have fun with it.
This device is great for streaming videos reading books,and web searching, which is what I enjoy!
The new paperwhite is a big improvement over the first generation Kindle I had. The text is much more crisp and easier to read, and the backlit screen makes reading possible in any lighting condition.
Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it.
I was in need of a quality bluetooth speaker and, as an Amazon Prime member, I figured I would give this a shot. I was blown away by the quality of the sound and the quality of the controls. I put it up their with Sonos and Bose as far as sound. The voice activations and commands have never failed to work for me and at full volume she can rattle some windows. The only drawback is it is not portable and requires an outlet to operate. Otherwise, you can't go wrong.
Even with decreased vision, I can read this, and at night. The backlight is so helpful. Relatives who use this recommended it. Geek Squad were helpful in teaching me how to use it, since this is my first reader. Fits in my small purse and is so wonderful to have while waiting somewhere.
Perfect tablet for my 4 yr old grandson. Easy to use.
Everyone should own an Amazon Echo. My Echo is like having someone that does exactly what you ask quickly without having to think about it or give you any back talk :). I love my Amazon Echo! This is beyond anything I've used in the past. I find myself relying on it more than I do any other device in my house. The entire family enjoys it. We are planning to purchase a couple more to have on each floor of the house. We love it! If you have been thinking about buying one and haven't, you should pick one up today. You'll be glad you did! A great device/friend the entire family will enjoy! By the way, ordering fast food delivery is one of my family's favorite ask! :)
Good basic tablet for checking email , web browsing , and reading ebooks.
good product
Mom like Echo...she talks to it and it talks back.
Great for my 65-year-old Mom. Price is very good. Worth buying!
She works great. We have enjoyed trying different questions.
this was a gift for my mom, she loves it!!! works great
I'm not to Happy with product. Very cheap .I wouldn't recommend it anyone
Has a great price if you don't mind all the advertising ads everywhere, limited apps offered by Amazon.
Never knows answers to question or has the song I want. And always says not getting connection. It sucks
This is a cheap tablet but really worth for the price. I bought this when it is on sale for $69 + $40 for 128 GB SD card, you have a great tablet when plenty of space. I used ipad for a while but i think it is so overpriced . This tablet is a deal !!!
We love this. Play almost any song just by asking. Speaker is loud and clear. Connects to my Samsung tv Bluetooth. A+
I had some thoughts about getting this for a 5 year old, but if you get the screen protector and a case I feel it will last a long time.
The ease of the touch screen makes for easy use with arthritis old granny nurse
Easy to set up and user friendly. This is my second device we have added to our home.
good product, easy to use for my 72 year old mom that knows nothing about electronics.
The box is really good and it has everything to you need to watch when it comes to online watching
Got this for a present for someone, and they love it. They really wanted an e reader not a tablet and that's why he loves it.
A friend told me about this product and it was a great deal!
I was excited to purchase the Amazon Echo, but when I thought that I could carry it out on the beach I was a little disappointed. If it had the capabilities to have a battery life to use without being plugged up it would be excellent.
It's the perfect table for kids (personal situation) has almost same applications the most tables has, with affordable price.You will be happy with your purchase:)
Great tablet that works well for ebooks and basic apps such as internet browsers etc. Great bargain for the money.
Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you
I gave this to my daughter and son N law for Christmas. They seem to really like it and are just starting to get the hang of it and learn more about it. But their initial using of this is all good and they like what it can do..
It all depends on what your using a 50 dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device. It is better for light use on the safe side use for 5h a day. 8h a day battery is the average, but runs down faster and over heats when playing a 3D game. But if u are on tight budget it is useful. ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them, for example clash of clans, racing rivals( which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores). And other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there.
I purchase this tablet for my son and it was very disappointing on the 3 exchanges I had to do. First the charger was not working, second the free time was not connecting and third exchange it was freezing. So many good reviews for this tablet but it did not work for me.
It is a excellent tablet for the price. Works great. No issues and complains.
Wow what doesn't this do. Enjoy listening and finding out what it can do.
Like the product, takes a little time to restore previous data
I like u can add more memory it's faster then the 1st gen picture quality is even better
This is one of the best media player i have owned.
I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader.
Bought this for my son for Christmas. He broke his tablet last year. Hopefully this one will last longer.
I bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for BYOD. It's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. For our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have Google App support on this. Since this runs Fire OS, it's everything Amazon proprietary. There as "howto" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those "fixes" from the articles on how to get Google app store working on this tablet. Since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for Google apps, we're returning it. Otherwise, Great tablet, but Fire OS restricts Google Apps.
The Apple Watch is great. I am very happy with the purchase.
This tablet is great for a kid or it is amazing in quality for $49.99
Bought for Xmass for my wife. She is not electronic competent, but found is easy to use.
I absolutely love this tablet! I love the price compared to other tablets on the market. Plus the display looks great! At first I was a bit skeptical about how it ran, or if it was any good, but I actually read a personal review about The Amazon Fire and it seemed like the person had a great time using it. The article was very helpful to me -- if you want to check it out yourself you can read it here http://www.quikrev.com/fire-tablet-7-display-wi-fi-8-gb-includes-special-offers-black/
Like it very well so far, easy setup and streaming works great.
First of all I would like to say that I'm very happy with my purchase. It is very helpful and useful gadgets for every single ebook reader. Battery life is awesome and it's very stylish display and overall look. Definitely must buy product.
I love my Kindle. The screen looks the same as the Voyager to my eyes. Couldn't imagine traveling without it!
I like this product. I will recommend this product for friends and family. Thank you
Bought this for my son with a 32gb memory. He uses it for school and play.
What a great price and very easy to use.Had a little trouble getting past my secured connection though.
My son wanted a tablet just for his books. We looked at e-readers and tablets, this was so much better and the price was perfect.
Unless I'm not using it right, I can't voice search within apps outside of the amazon realm. Other than that, pretty sweet setup.
I compared it to the kindle fire hd and didn't see much of a difference. Love it!
I bought my Echo when it first came out. I Love It! It made a very nice Christmas gift. My mother was thrilled. I thought I knew a lot of things to ask it but she has me beat already. She lives alone and loves having it "talk to her". She's hooked up her lights to it (by herself) and loves that she can have the lights turned on before she heads downstairs. I don't walk out the door without asking Alexa the weather for the day. It's a fun thing to play around with stupid questions, she has quite the sense of humor!
Most definitely worth the money. I bought the fire tv box after owning a firestick and it is a great device especially if you are an amazon prime member. Twice the speed of the firestick with availability to add external hard drives and memory cards. Bluetooth enables you to add keyboards and game controllers if you wish. Also has an ethernet port so you don't have to use WiFi. I absolutely love it and if I had the choice I would buy a fire tv box rather than a firestick.
Was given as a gift and Husband extremely pleased with the purchase.
This is a nice tablet useful on the go and I love it
My wife and I both enjoyed our Kindle Voyage so much that we had to buy a second one. This is our first E-reader, and it could not be more user-friendly. It works well in all kinds of environments and lighting conditions. A definite winner!
Works really well ! My kids love it and it's so easy to use !
The Echo has great sound and responds well to voice commands. I have not tried out all of the features yet, but so far I like it.
Convenient to use. Can take it with you when traveling
We have had fun with asking Alexa random questions that she readily answers in addition to enjoying the various stations and music lists available to us. I'm sure we will never exhaust Echo's abilities as it does a lot and we're sure enjoying it.
It was a great kindle fire! It functions well as a reading device and a tablet. Plays good audio books.
This is so easy to use. An enjoying the many many unexpected things that can be done.
I had a kindle fire 3rd gen and I liked it a lot, but this one is better. I like the SD card slot for extra memory or to move pics from camera to kindle, book reading is great, I don't do many videos, but those I have watched seem to be fine. Graphics are good. Small enough to fit in my bag on the go, but big enough that I am able to type easily. Would recommend.
We bought this for our daughter so she has tablet she can read on that lasts a long time on one charge and doesn't play video games.
This is our 2nd Amazon Echo already. We got the black in in our living room & this on outlr master's bedroom. They are amazing products!
The wife and kids love it. Thinking of buying another one.
works like it should
It fits easily into smallest purse so it's always at hand when waiting in lines while traveling. Lightweight, especially without the case. Shape of back provides easy grip. Accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand. Would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate, but that's a minor thing.
Easy to use this device and the sound is great. We continue to find new ways to use it
The amazon fire '7 tablet was $33 on black Friday. How could I not buy a name brand tablet for that little
Great bargain for money. Easy to read in sunlight and while laying in bed.
I'm very happy with this. It's easy to use and I'd recommend this.
I bought these kindle fire tablets for Christmas presents for the grandkids... They love them. Good durable tablets at a great price.
This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
Once I understand how to use this, it will be awesome
Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.
Price was great, tablet not the fastest but easily works with my echo and Amazon Prime.
I bought two of these for my great grand children. I charged them and played around on them before I have it to them and I wish I had bought one for myself. Everything worked great. I think this is a great purchase.
I you're a part of the amazon world - i.e. prime. This is incredible for the price - it just works and you can add memory to the 8gb for bringing along videos if you not on the web.
I had to replace my Kindle 3G keyboard after several years because it would no longer charge. So I got this one and I'm satisfied, but I really miss my 3G. The only feature that's better in the newer Kindle is the light. Turning pages is my main complaint with the touch screen. It sometimes doesn't register the touch and you have to do it again. Also going back a page is a pain. Supposedly the left 25% of the screen is for going back, but it seems like the left 10% at best and just to be safe I press on the very edge. I miss the buttons for turning pages.I also miss the 3G even though I didn't use it all that often. Now I just need to make sure I plan ahead on road trips.
Way better than the fire stick, load faster and can be plugged straight to the router
Good value for the price and for the children. The apps are enough to let them play and read.
I wanted an e-reader that will read manga well and this did not disappoint!
For books games and internet it's perfectSound is a ittle weak
Great device easy to use and easy to read especially in sunlight.
I use Prime, Hulu and Netflix for my TV and movie needs. I also own two firesticks already. I wanted one with 4K support for a 4K tv. If u need 4K and want a slightly faster Fire streaming device, go with the player. Otherwise the Firestick is more than adequate for streaming needs.
Great product perfect for my needs at home. Used for my TV remote to Roku, radio apps wireless connection to my sound bar and fast browser all in one. I only paid $35 for this device brand new from best buy.
Pretty good value tablet. Works like expected and has some good apps. Only downside with memory at 8gigs.
This works as described and Am very happy with it.
Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link
Fire tv tablet has great apps and are easy to function
This Kindle was purchased to replace a damaged kindle for my grandson. HE is familiar with the Kindle format so there was no learning curve. WE are both happy with the purchase.
This is good for traveling light but still possessing research powerful, especially in Wi-Fi areas.
I bought this for my son. He absolutely loves it. His purchase was mainly based on his friends having this model and being very pleased with it. He is very pleased with it.
Love this e-reader! Lightweight, easy to read screen even in very bright conditions. Very easy to check out and return library books without ever going to the library. Would recommend this product to anyone
The Echo has awesome sound and is super fast. We love it!
I work with technology every day, and this device wows even me. With Alexa, imagine Siri on steroids, able to control your entire music collection stored in your Amazon library as well as music from iHeartRadio, Prime Music, Nest Thermostats, etc. Ask for a joke. Get news updates. set timers and alarms. All with your voice, and with very little misunderstanding. Honestly, Siri never impressed me much, but Alexa is super fast and responsive.
Sound production is outstanding!! Very easy to set up and use!
I will definitely purchase another tablet a larger size for me at a different time.
I love it. Long battery life, easy to use, perfect
I love my new fire! Such a smooth running tablet. I can use audible as well on this and Netflix and fun games. Battery lasts long time as well.
I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. I own one as well and I love it.
kindle fire is a great product also caught it at a special price its super fast and takes great photos
Alexa works great and does lots of things for you. Fun for the family.
$50 for a tablet, yes please! I gave it a whirl and what a great tablet for the cost. Its pretty quick in the apps, i thought it might lag or be a little slow, I was wrong!
I love the voice command and online resources !!!!
Great deal for a handy tablet. I have no complaints.
The amazon reader is everything I dreamed it would be. I can read in the dark. It helps me get to sleep sooner, because the light is not as bright. My love of reading has only increased! ! A great purchase no doubt about that! !
I like the fire tv because it's easy to use and I can get all my services in one box. I also like the voice control feature and the included games. The thing I dont like is that sometimes the cache gets full and the stream starts to cuts even with my 100M conection. A faster dual or quad core procesor with more memory would be great.
Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again.
I never thought I would ever purchase a Kindle device for reading books, but now that I have one, I wish I would have done this a long time ago. I enjoy being able to read anywhere. Plus being able to purchase a book anytime I want is such a nice feature.
This tablet is perfect for kids under 12 years. It has lots of fun apps for the kids.
Sleep design and works great. Ideal gift for the person who has everything.
Good tablet for traveling and reading on the road.
Does a great job allowing me to watch shows i want to watch
This device is easy to use, and with internet and selected video apps, there's no reason to leave the house!
Alexa was a gift to a friend while I was traveling to Dubai. They popped in their suitcase to take to their home in Thailand and have been raving ever since. And Cara in the Boston, South Bay location was the BEST BEST BUY gal EVER!
The kids never put them down, Plenty of apps to keep them interested. Parental locks keep them safe.
I had the original Kindle Fire 8.9 inch and then upgraded to the Kindle Fire 10". I purchased one of these as a gift for a couple of family members. I setup these tablets and I was surprised that for the price how fast it was and it has the same apps and pretty much functionality of my 10". The screen resolution isn't as good as a higher priced tablet. But, for $49 it's great! Even if you have a tablet already this makes for a good one just to throw in the bag with you when your out and about. I use Kindle tablets primarily for media and entertainment purposes (Amazon Prime Movies, Netflix, Hulu, and the News stand).
Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids
Love this player, I have purchased 3 already and will put one in each room. The quad core processor is very good
If you are a Amazon Prime or PlayStation Vue member, this is a must buy. Easy to use connect. Simple log in. Intuitive guide. Small, but not too small. Great remote. Relatively inexpensive. 4k qualityOnly wish I could transfer remote features to my Logitech remote.
Excellent product with a multitude of uses . Love the fact that it is expandable.
This is a great product. Alexa never lets you down !
This Kindle is great. Customer service rep for technical questions---not so much.
Works well, except during internet outages. The ability to perform hands-free tasks in the kitchen is priceless.
I was surprised to find it did not come with any type of charging cords so I had to purchase one and then found my Sprint HTC 3D charger is faster. I would not purchase again- 1st item I've ever not liked I've purchased from Amazon
Decent tablet. I knew it wouldn't be fast but it does get the job done and it was relatively cheap.
This was a great Christmas gift for our grand daughter.
Set up was easy. Alexa so far has been on target and extremely helpful.
better than I expect a and with Alexander is magical
I got this tablet for my godson who loves videos, didn't want to spend to much and this was the perfect tablet for the price $33, great product great price.
Bought this for my 6 yr old, she does everything on it, tech savy son set up parental limits on tablet, love that, it does run kind of slow when trying to watch a movie.
got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet
Fun product that can be used for many purposes. Great for streaming or reading on the go with great graphics. Makes an awesome gift!
I really enjoyed the versitility of this item. it works wonderfully.
This small little tablet is perfect for reading emails and playing computer games. It's light weight makes it easy to hold for even long periods of time. It's low price makes it affordable as a supplement to other tech items. I keep mine by my favorite chair.
This is kind of your mini assistant to find the info on your voice command and also plays a quality sound. I paired it with Bluethooth and can listen to Youtube. It reads my audiobook and frequently I ask for traffic updates before heading out, next day's weather forecast before hitting the pillow, newsflash and HBR Management Tip getting ready and currency exchange rates apart from playing music, etc. So much to explore. Results are cincise and accurate. Voice recognition from far away in the room is great. Kids love listening to jokes and ask fact finding questions. Wife likes ease of alarm, asking time without looking at wall clock and enjoys creating shopping list. This is an awesome device.
Tons of things Alexa can do!!!!! PLay music, tell jokes, uodates on news, make phone calls. Juts a great new technology that makes life a ton easier
Very easy and dependable. It fits perfect in a purse or pocket to take to work to use on breaks.
Bought one for my son a while back, now got one for my daughter. Great tablet for whole family at a great price.
I love this tablet. The size fits perfectly in one hand. The display is wonderful and the loaded apps have me reading again. It is the absolute best!
Very cool device in general, and becomes even more convenient with every smart device you add to this system. I think the Google Home is smarter, but it's cooler to say, "Alexa..." vs. "Ok/Hey Google..."
Great product! Love BB Great product! Love BB Great product! Love BB
It's hard to beat the quality for the price it cost. Great for the kids.
Love my fire tv. I brought a sock earlier but this more stable and quick. Definitely would buy again.
Very good media player with a lot of options and features.
It's amazing! Best gift I've bought for my grand babies so far!
I live these boxes. Since I installed one on every tv in my house everyone that comes over wants one. I have bought so many for family members as gifts.
Shipped fast. Easy setup. Works great. Would definitely recommend.
I was looking for a tablet for my five-year-old daughter found a tablet on my Walmart for $40. When we opened it and tried to set it up The Wi-Fi was not working. I spoke with a coworker it indicated he bought an Amazon fire tablet for his child. I was shocked to find that it was the same price as the one I had already purchased. I returned the original and bought this one. It is packed full of ads and amazon specific programs, but I guess there is a reason it is so cheap!! My daughter loves it, does everything she wants and more!!!
It is a decent tablet. Bought for my 12 year old. He is happy with it. Camera and video could be little better but it is ok.
in the world of voice assistants the amazon echo does stand out as i love the device
I bought these for my young grandchildren (5 & 7) and they love them. They love to take pictures and make videos. They also play games on them. The battery life lasts for a long time also.
It was an affordable gift for my son and he enjoys it and finds it helps him in school.
I had researched the product thoroughly and it performed as expected.
Great picture, just the right size and has the blue dimmer
I hope to use it once I figure out how to use it. I am trying.
This tablet has been easy to use and setup for my daughter.
Great alternative to cable. Easy to use and set up
Perfect, just needs an app to locate when set aside
I bought 4 of these tablets for Christmas presents. 2 of them were for my 4 and 6 year old grandkids. I love how they have parental controls and how easy they are for the kids to use. We are still browsing the app store to find them games but all the ones they used to use my phone for were found right away.
easy to be understood and the color is a nice arctic white
I've owned one of the original Kindle for years and love it. In fact I handed it down to my daughter. I just thought it would be nice to own the newest version with the built-in light. The other thing I considered was the weight. I love my new Kindle as much as I have loved my old one.
The fire stick is easy to use and set up. I wish it were easier to search for movies and shows.
We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad.
Best feature I like is that it plays in 4K.Apple tv does not
I purchased the Ecco as an addition to my home automation. Works great. The wife and kids love it.
Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
The echo sounds great music fills up the room. Makes life easier answers your questions turns lights on and off weather news her skills are endless. I love it
I'm really enjoying this little tablet. I wat h Amazon Prime movies on it. I shop, check NFL scores and make dining reservations as well as keep up with news and personal email. It's just great.!
The amazon fire provides an excellent budget tablet.
YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT
I got this for my little niece and she loves it. It's a great value
I really like the smaller size and backlight compared to my last kindle touch!
Really good tablet for kids. Easy for kids to used it.
The tablet seems to work well. Not as fast as some but, not bad. I found it was not as easy to find an antivirus product to work with the Fire 7, as it was for other android products. I will use this tablet for reading books instead of surfing the web.
Got it for my grandson he loves it.it is a very good tablet!!!
I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet
Easy to hold & read with no strain to eyes. Love that I can highlight text.
Bought this for my friend, he likes it so muchEasy to set up a good good quality speaker
This product is exactly what I needed and exactly as advertised.
This is my very first kindle. I am enjoying reading more books. The size is quite comfortable as well as the weight. The battery life is quite good. If you're looking for a new way to read book this is definitely the one.
What a great ereader. Amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. Light and comfortable to hold. Perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive back-lighting. Seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. I would definitely recommend this and would buy again.
The price is right! Can't beat the price on this model for an introductory tablet or a tablet for a child. Wonderful that the tablet offers internet access for books, games, and movies. Good size for travelling and small hands.
Love it! Ask Alexa and you shall receive! Music, news, local weather! Great!
My son uses his tablet on a daily basis. He makes sure he has his case on it and can use all the apps. I can also use it and put on parental protections.
We use this as a hands free speaker in the kitchen. It is great for using Pandora and Amazon music. The only downfall to this product is that to take advantage of the many "skills" Alexa can do, you must memorize the specific prompt words for that particular skill. Besides that, it is great and I recommend buying one!
I bought this for my wife as a gift and she and the rest of the family love it.
We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it
Have only had it a week but enjoy all the things it can do.
Great product and I'm in the process of cutting my cable tv.
Nice to have music, alarms, shopping list, lights, all available at the sound of your voice, works great! Hub for home, Highly recommended!
Wanted a nice Reader, this is it for under $50!!!!
I use Alexa daily and love it! Would def recomment
The fire tv has access to numerous applications. If you're looking to replace cable, this is definitely a first start. If youre not, you still have access to lots of movies, apps, tv shows all in one place. Binge watching in full effect!
Muy recomendable.
Can't beat kindle fire, already have 2 and got 2 more Thanksgiving sale for $33!!!
This item is ok if your not looking for a big name brand tablet.
Looking for ways to save on cable. Still required cable account to access many of the apps.
Great sound and voice response, easy to set up and use.
This is our second Echo; now have one upstairs and downstairs!Love having our favorite music available at any time and the sound is really good for the size of the unit. We also have access to instant weather and information on just about any subject you can think of!
Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so.
So this thing sucks not many apps work on the amazon fire stick. It is better than the box but still blows chucks.
Best Buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. Like parental control feature
Bought this for my mother as a gift. I was concerned she would not use it, but she has loved it.
Excellent Picture, speed and overall quality. Movie selections range from 50's to date. UHD is the reason I made this purchase.
Purchased two Fire8 tablets for my children. My son loves it for reading books from library and my daughter loves listening to audio books.They both were not sure they would like the tablet but they really love them.
I am extremely satisfied with this streaming device. I was not sure if it was for me but the FireTv has all the processor speed that I have needed and with Sling TV I was able to drop my TV service provider.
THIS ITEM IS ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I MADE THIS SEASIN. I ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT
Bought this for my husbands birthday. We both use it everyday for news weather and store lists. Awesome for playing music too. Highly recommend
This is one of the best devices out right now! I love it!
I like the tablet because it is a good size and east for a three year old to use.
cool stuff for home automation & very useful for other services like News, Alarm, Music, Weather and etc.
Easy to use and great picture. Alexa voice control is good.
to spite the fact that i have nothing but good things to say about amazon and anthing i've ever gotten from them. and that i love my fire. i find it greedy that the wall charger doesn't come with the kindle. not everyone, ok most people, but still not everyone has a usb port to plug into. i'm taking my charger back. i think amazon should make things right and let anyone who purchased a kindle without a charger have one for free, or credit those who had to buy one.
Easy to setup and navigate- several TV/Movies available in UHD
My daughter has a great time reading and researching and playing games on this.
My son truly loves his Kindle. He uses it everyday.
Although sonos speaker sounds better, this is not bad, and at a cheaper price. Soon it is reported Alexa will be able to control your sonos system as well.It also includes voice control and provides 'skills' which allow for home automation possibilities. In my mind well worth the price for the voice controlled audio features, and has potential for many other uses!
I ordered my fire HD like a week before Christmas. The day I received it I ordered a case for it on amazon and before I even got the case it fell fro! About 2 ft off the floor on carpet and the screen cracked. I called BestBuy and I was told that I had. Free 6 months protection on it so I made an appointment with geek squad my husband called out of work to take me and when we go they tell me that I don't have any protrvtion plan and that there isn't anything they can do for me. Honestly it got to me because I you can't do anything about it its fine just tell me. But don't male me gp allthe way there and waste my time. Ended up buying a better and bigger tablet. Although my amazon fire still works its screen is all cracked oh well.
Good starter tablet. Best used as a book reader. Not really for business use
Purchased several tablets for the children for gifts. Easy to use hang the kids love them. My only complaint is that the charger could be more durable
i really like the voyage, it looks great, and worth the money.
Kindle works really well in sunlight, there is no glare. Very easy to use and navigate.
She doesn't go a day without reading something on there. She says it works wonderful outside, which is exactly what she wanted. She also has a fire, but doesn't work that well for her outside.
This device is fun with all the different apps you can use. Great speaker quality too.
I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
Alexa is fun. You can play music and ask it questions. It doesn't play all the music you want and will not answer all your questions. I have yet to connect it to any home devices but that's the next step. I see a lot of potential for this product.
Used for internet surfing . Does a great job, it's great!
Love this product has so many movies old to new as well as tv shows tv episodes. Its super.
This is my 2nd FireTV I now own, and love them both. Setup was a snap even without it preconfigured from Amazon.
Got this tablet for a 6-year old. It has all the bells & whistles of the more expensive Kindles, but I don't get upset if it gets lost or broken.
Gave this as a gift. Grandson loves it. We liked the low price.
My daughter loves her new kindle, now she can pick from hundreds of books.
need more expects on tablet & computer with nohow.
Portability perfectBattery greatEase of use. Excellent
I have a few top end Bluetooth speakers and this Amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in
Excellent Amazon product perfect for my 4 year old, I put it into kids mode and she loved it!
Great item for the price. Love the fact that you can hard wire to your internet for lightning fast streaming.
Love that I do not have to constantly go to the movies and having things at my fingertips works
My son likes the tablet well enough. He really only watches videos and plays games on it.
I really like the value of this Fre. It is thin, light, and has all the features of those higher priced tablets. A good camera lens....and access to amazon deals make this well worth $69. Try it!
Very happy with this kindle. Easy to set up and use. All my books purchased previously on Amazon came right down to the device. Now I'm all set for vacation reading without a carry-on full of books.
I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.
This is a very good product. But if purchased this product won't use Google play stuff!
The kindle is great! Great product and great price.
Favorite part was how easy it is to read at night.
My wife has enjoyed this tablet a lot. She plays a lot of card games and looks up recipe.
Page turner. I would have given 5 stars. A little disappointed with the ending.
The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.
Was thinking of getting my 5 year old her own Ipad or the kindle. I'm so glad that I picked the kindle, it comes with a kids version of her own log in and is so easy for her to find appropriate games, movies, and apps, even though she can't read yet. She loves it too!
This is the kindle to buy. Great resolution and a backlight is great. The higher end Kindle's don't justify the price difference. Use it all time time and love it.
This is the cheapest tablet I have ever bought, but the quality is better than I thought. It is a little bit heavier than ipad mini 2, and the android os works fine.
It is great to have numerous books right at your finger tips. Especially while traveling. Bought this for a backpacking trip and have used it nearly everyday since.
Alexa is the most useful product I have purchased. My Husband is handicapped and home all day while I work. He asks Alexa to put the lights on for him and she does. He ask her to tell him a joke and she does. Anything he wants to know he turns to Alexa...
Nice tablet for the price. I wish the colorful ones available in the store.
Works very well, even after the novelty wore off we have found it entertaining and useful,
I was hesitant to buy the Echo, but waited until it was on sale. It's great for music and ties to Amazon Prime or Bluetooth to your phone. Unfortunately, it needs to be plugged in at all times to be powered on.
Easy to use and reasonably priced. I bought it for my wife as a Christmas present.
If you want to save money and cut your cable bill this is the way to go.I am now saving over $80 a month because of all the stations that I get now on Amazon Fire Tv.
OMG! This product is awesome. I never knew my children can be so quiet when they are playing or reading a book on this device. I love it and it makes them not want to play with your phone anymorte bc what thy find on your phone, they can find on this device. Thank you for this.They have learned a lot already and still learning. Recommended it to all my freinds with children already. Great for the price!
The Screen resolution is great and I like the built-in case
Bought this as a gift for my 3 year old granddaughter. She is learning how to get to her apps and play some games on it. I like that I can have contol over what she can watch and play.
Enjoy the kindle. Just the right size and easy to handle
The family loves it use it every day can't beat the price
I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!
Finally decided to upgrade from a Kindle 3 to the 2nd generation Kindle Paperwhite. Still hardly have to charge this thing and the back light is really nice for reading at night and is always the perfect brightness.
Late gift for my grandson. He is very happy with it. Easy for him (9yo ).
I need a tablet for reading ebooks and search dictionary for new vocabulary. This one fit my need and it can also check email, listen music and go online searching stuff. I have iPad at home and put this at office, so I don't need to bring the same tablet back and forth. It suits my need very well.
This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted.
it is set up way more like tablet then then the old kindles
This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners.
Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook
I wanted to avoid the excessive blue light created by I-Pads, phones, and other color electronic devices. This lets me read right up till bedtime with no problems.
Streams much better than smart tv does. Well worth it
I normally do not write reviews but this device warrants one. Could not be happier with overall performance and capabilities, especially in controlling home automation devices.
Got this for a Christmas gift for a friend. She loves it! No issues with product, software or quality.
This tablet is incredibly inexpensive. I have an iPad mini, a windows tablet and another older Fire tablet and this newest version is one of the best tablets I have seen! It's quick, has a great screen and the battery is great. I bought this to take on a trip to SF and used it both ways on the plane to watch movies I had downloaded and used it over the weekend while I was there and didn't have to charge it the whole time. I like that they moved away from the carousel and just have the app icons listed the way they are now. I have recommended this to a lot of my friends, especially the ones with kids.
Good compared to other systems like Roku but really need to get an easy way to close apps running in background.
One of the best streaming devices for the price. Bonus points if you are a Prime member or invested in Amazon's infrastructure.
I bought this on Black Friday and I have been using it for about a month. It is faster than my Fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5GB vs 1GB RAM. The screen resolution is fine though not the best. At this price I am not complaining. Amazon adds some nice features as well. The advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. Not a problem at all. Even at full price this is a good deal.
This is my favorite kindle so far. The size is perfect and the weight is minimal. I love the fact it is back lit and I don't need a book light.
Bought for my nephew. He didn't know how to operate it. It is a little tricky. Would not recommend for a child
Bought as gift, don't know the details, but kids love be it!
I had two kindles previously, I think 3rd gen white one with keyboard, cheapest kindle I won couple years back from a raffle, and finally purchased this paper white. So much easier on my eyes and my wife doesn't get bothered by a little bit of light it produces. I was a casual reader who reads one book every quarter and with paper white I read 1-2 books a month minimum.
The Amazon - Fire TV is easy to learn and wonderful customer service they will walk you throw any thing you need help with.
The Fire tablet is great, especially for the price! And if you are an Amazon Prime member, it's even better. You can read books for free using Amazon's Lending Library and watch Prime videos for free too. You can even get Google Play Store and download apps (just Google it) on the Fire. Make sure you get a micro SD card right away, because the 8GB internal storage fills up very quickly.
This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I'm really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle!
I am pleased with unit, I was surprised that it does not pair with external speakers, but other than that, good product.
Awesome device! Using it to cut the cord and it works great
This is the best ereader I've ever owned. Very responsive and lightweight.
I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)
Got this for both my children after the constant breaks on more expensive products. The best decision I've made!They are happy. Apps are amazing.If you are using this for internet usage... not so much.If going to amazon app store and books, it is awesome!
This was a girl for my husband, he loves it! Great sound & picture
I am so impressed with this tablet. My seven year old loves its app, gaming and e-reader functions.
You couldn't ask for a best tablet for the price, great quality.
Good productThe only thing I don't like is that the remote is unresponsive some times. All in all good steaming device.
My nephews love their new tablets!! Great Christmas gifts!
Great buy for the price. We currently own 4 of them. Buying my grandson one for Christmas too.
This was a replacement for another kindle. They are very durable and do everything I need them to do.
This product does exactly what I wanted it to do and is good value for the purchase price.
i love to read book on that device. i would recommend this
It's a great tablet for kids and great videos look great and colorful
Bought the fire TV excited about the 4K support. The first night it refused to load video content. I could only stream music. Now it refuses to load at all. It has completely stopped responding to the remote. Remote feels cheap.
Whats the point of this without the cable to charge!
This one I got for a relative who enjoyed ours. We love listening to music, asking it questions and getting the weather. I know there are more features but these alone makes it a winner.
My husband has a kindle fire and 3 of my kids do also. My husband loves his. My kids tablets are great with a variety of apps. Maine draw back, tablets vs kitchen floor and the floor won. Tablet 1 screen cracked.
Its a good tablet for that price. screen resolution is also good. I have purchased for my friend.
I bought it for my mom and it is perfect. It recharges quickly and was very cheap and effective. Nothing fancy but sturdy and gets the job done, like the San Antonio spurs.
Got for my wife for Christmas. She loves it! Would recommend to others wanting the experience in a smaller device.
The 4k paired with our 4k television gives an amazing picture! Well worth it!
Perfect for kids with the child profile. Only downside is the limited space
Really enjoy the Echo. Very helpful in weather reports, traffic updates, timers, and music.
I love reading before going to bed, but backlit electronic devices tend to keep me awake just when I should be getting tired enough to fall asleep. The screen has a great resolution, the device is a snap to set up, and there's little to no glare if you take it outside. Additionally, the battery lasts just about forever. Straight out of the box I used it for almost three weeks before I charged I, and I still had nearly a quarter charge left. It's now my preferred reading device as compared to my tablets, which include an iPad and an LG Gpad. Highly recommended.
I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one.
everyday this thing gets better! Great speaker quality and sound. The ever growing list of commands and functions ensure lagging interest and usability!
Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.
We are really enjoying all the benefits of having Alexa. She greets us every morning with a fun fact, news, weather, devotion, reads kids a book. In the evening, she turns the lights out & plays a medley of songs to sleep. We love Prime membership & all the great things it adds to Alexa.And now read she will be added to Apple iPhone.We will be buying more for other floors of our home. The speakers' quality is also very good! We highly recommend you buy one or more.
Had to return as the wifi was a little slow for my child's patience.
It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear...
Being a newby at this internet stuff is easier after the first 30 days of free trial. Has been down once via the company still working on issues.
Best purchase ever, my eyes are getting bad with age and reading on my phone No longer works, great product for the price
Great way to listen to music and great questions answered.
It's ok I am just used to Google so much! But it still good
Great phones for my sons that are 13 and my 8 year old lives his kindle
I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service.
I bought this so that I could read in the bedroom without waking my infant, and without bright lights shining right in my eyes. I'm so glad I bought it! And the battery life is amazing!
This tablet stands head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to proportion of price/quality. Amazon continues to improve upon its quality.
My son loves it! He plays with it daily. This is his 2nd kindle (we upgraded versions).
I love alexa ,she plays all my favorite song , and i dont gotta move a finger to do it.
The kindle is easy on the eyes to read. The light doesn't make the screen look like a computer screen which I was worried about. Simple and easy to use.
Price is great and my 6 year old LOVES it. Overall perfect.
My granddaughter loves it. It was a perfect gift for her long airplane trip.
I had the first generation fire tv and I really don't see any reason to upgrade. Sure it has 4k support but only for Amazon movies, not Netflix. I returned this device.
Nice tablet. Love reading books on this, kid profile option is excellent
I have the Apple tv in one room and this in the other. Both are great boxes, but I must say this things absolutely flies when watching amazon instant videos. Almost zero buffering time even on 4K videos.
I now have 3 of these tablets. I use them for my harmony remotes, baby camera monitors, youtube for the kids, receiver software, reading articles and books, games and many other things. Its not the best tablet out there, but for under $50 its great. My one issue is that it does NOT have the play store, so if amazon does not have an app you will have to side load it. Other than that you can't beat it.
Great sound easy to set up and use. My wife is truly enjoying it.
This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it.
Very easy to set up and operate. The voice command is especially nice when playing music and so far I've found the music library to be quite large with a good selection. If you use Amazon at all I would recommend the Prime membership as it pays for itself quickly and drastically increases the available content in the media libraries. No, I'm not an Amazon employee :)
This is by far one of the best purchases I've made in a while. I'm enjoying all the different forms of music available by just asking "Alexa".
Works great. Having a physical internet connection works great for streaming
Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.
This tablet is useful if you have prime and invest in the Amazon ecosystem. I prefer my other Android tablets more, but for the price I paid for this one it was a great deal.
Very pleased with options to watch. Saves big on cable bills
Great gift I bought for someone as Christmas gift and she loves it!
This is a great device ! Nice sound easy to set up
I love love love this tablet. My old hp tablet finally quit working and check around what would serve my needs and this was it
Love love love this thing. I listen to all my jams in the morning while checking in the the forecast so I always if a sweater is needed. Lol
This is great for the beginner, not a big investment.
Bought as a Christmas gift. I got it on Black Friday, so the price was very good. My daughter can use this in her classes and it's a great size. I even bought another one after Christmas because we liked it so much!
I bought this new Kindle Fire HD 8 just to have a larger device. I've had a 7 for many years and love it. This is just a case of size does make a difference. The only downside is that the multiple chargers I've got don't fit the 8 so I'm left with just the one that came with the device.
I looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 20-40 bucks. This is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years!!!! Drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.
I received this as a Mother's Day gift from my husband and love it. I was very pleased with the sound while listening to music. All of the other features are great. I would highly recommend getting this so worth it.
good quality product will buy again best buy always has what i need
Loads TV, movies, applications very smoothly fast. Easy to use.
I love my Kindle. It's light and I haven't experienced nnby problems with it thus far. I just wish I could upload my music from Google Play on here
This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising.
I bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves the games and camera. Works great. Glad I got it for her.
This 7" 2015 version should have been marketed to children only. It's like a very "dumbed" down, cheap version of the better FireHD and HDX. Screen is not as good, battery life is bad, no mirroring to TV and it's slooowww as can be. If you've never owned another kind of Kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version. For those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. Another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one. I got mine on Black Friday for a little over $30. total with shopping discounts and I'm still sending it back! That's how disappointed I am with it.
I had resisted a kindle for years and finally gave in for travel. Yes, I am one of "those" who love books! Surprisingly, I really like the paper white kindle. It is easy to read & works well in most lighting situations. There are two things that keep me from loving it. 1) I really wish it had the option of reading the book out loud. 2) I thought it would be a lot cheaper to get books for the kindle. It may be a little cheaper but not a lot. You would think that without the cost of paper, etc, that savings would be passed on to the customer. Since they don't, I tuck it away until I travel.
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He loved it and really enjoy it for playing games and reading books.
I'd say for the price it was a decent Tablet it did what I needed it to do but the support I'd say through the App side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side. So I'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better.
I brought this tablet as a present for my wife since her last tablet she had just died out. It seems to work well for her and she swems very happy with it.
Good product and excited to use it bought some for our kids
Bought for husband to replace his old one. Uses it all the time and would recommend.
Good tablet for reading, playing and browsing. Value for money
The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It's perfect.
This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too.
I have used different streaming android boxes and Apple TV over the years. Love this one. Starts up super fast and remote is very responsive. I mainly purchased it to use it with Kodi but I like how easy you can browse Amazon prime videos. I recommended it to a few friends and family. They all love it.
This tablet brings hours of enjoyment educationally to the user,
The amazon fires are super to use. You can do more than read a book on them.
Since it is called powerfast, I thought it is a fast charger but it is not fast at all. It worked but it took about 5 hours to charge an almost empty Kindle Fire HD 8 inch tablet.
We first purchased the stick and worked great but we wanted something more powerful. This allowed us to connect directly to our router and got great connection. No more pauses or buffering. I would buy again if I needed to.
Got this as a gift to my mom. She absolutely loved the color and how easy to use.
i like this tablet its small fast & is just as good as any other tablet.
The many features make this an ideal tablet purchase.
nice price, loved the price match--easy to get refund of cost differencemuch simpler to view than original kindle
i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50...
This is much better than the fire tv, but also a little bit more expensive. It's worth it.
The Amazon Echo is a very easy device to use. It makes it easy to control all of your smart devices. Like music on your computer, cell phone, smart tv's, light bulbs, and many other devices. All you do is tell it what to do and it does the rest!
Has kid timers to limit your child's time using the tablet. Fun camera for kids with "stickers". My kids love it!
I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid.
Better that reading for the phone or traditional tablet
This is the best gift a reader can receive. Easy to use.
Great for reading e-mail, pictures or viewing internet.
Previous kindle user updating to the paperwhite. Easy to read screen and the 3g is a good feature to have while traveling.
Great product and lightweight. Battery keeps its charge. Would recommend this product to another young person
Excited to use the Amazon Fire Box. Very easy to use.
Great Electronic! Great size! Great Quality! My son is in love with this tablet
Good deal, better than purchasing from Amazon, from BB, you get the points, but get nothing from Amazon.
Would have liked more features for the money paid..
I love being able to download books and read them whenever I want. I carry it in my purse and can read it anytime I'm in a situation where I'm waiting, on the bus, etc. It's much more convenient than carrying a book around. The only thing that I'd improve is making it easier to get the homepage/toolbar to display.
My kids were wrestling me, and I called for Alexa to help. Guess it didn't understand my screaming from the other room.OK Best Buy, give me my 25 points.
Opened it up and didn't realize it was what he had almost bought for himself.A lot of fun and very helpful in answering questions we have.Will expand to work with home appliances on birthday's. Love it.
I chose this to check email and Facebook because I don't have a smartphone. It's a lot quicker than getting on my laptop. I use it for YouTube and Pandora also. My only complaint is my old eyes struggle with the smaller print. I am pleased with it!
Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay
Great product the kids love it. We use it for music and news. Kids love to ask it to tell them jokes
Great addition to any media center. Easy to use and great picture and sound quality!
Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media.
Great tablet and very user friendly. Great to read off of and surf the web
My 4 yo grandnephew and 3 yo daughter love them! The tablet does freeze but that's what happens sometimes! They love them!
This little tablet is just what I needed. Easy to use and functional with a good display. For cloud access, reading email, internet, using apps, music and photo storage what more can you ask for. Expandable memory this really has nearly everything you could want on an inexpensive device. Don't worry ads don't get in the way they are only one the first screen.
Perfect size for traveling, sound is amazing and easy to use.
My family and i have a great time with ECHO. it is easy enough for my 4 year old to use for whatever she wants. great product.
I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.
I bought it for my 6 year old nephew. It's user friendly and my nephew loves to have his own tablet finally
Great product, makes life easier. Gaining in intelligence.
Love the fact that you can ask questions and get your answer quickly.
Easy to install, nice alternative to cable great shows on demand.
amazon keeps adding more feature - it willl be light years ahead of google home when it comes out
Great speed and fAst great for kid and teens Upgrades easy
Works well! We had one of the original fires and it finally died which is why we bought another. Great clarity and better internet also
This is great toy. You may not need it, but you'll want it, and love it when you start using it.
Streaming services run great. Multi-Tasking is terrible though. A lot of games aren't supported. Good for browsing the web and streaming only
My daughter loves this tablet. We purchased it for her for Christmas. I found a great bumper case on Amazon and very cheap. This was an awesome deal!
I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn.
Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.
the tablet is just the right size for our granddaughter. she loves it. she can play her little games and has so much fun with it.
These tablets are so much better in different colors. Well worth it!
For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with "Silk" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in.
It's a little slow on some things but otherwise I really like the tablet.
Bought this primarily to use as an e-reader. Got it on Cyber Monday so it was a pretty good deal. I live in the Google ecosystem so I loaded it with the google apps after buying it. I pretty much ignore all the amazon stuff. If I want to use the internet I either use wi-fi or access it via using my phone as a hotspot. It is a decent size for reading, although I think I would have been better off with 16 gigs instead of 8 for storage. I have installed a 32gb micro sd card for extra storage.
Cut the cord, get rid of cable, and buy one of these. Great device easy to use. No reason to spend hundred plus dollars a month on cable just buy one of these and pay 15 to 20 bucks a month And subscribe to a couple video services
This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
Great product to have in your home , very easy to use.
I love my kindle! I got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it!!!!!!! so I decided to get one for myself as well and I am glad I did. It is very easy to read books in it. I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you love to read books, I highly recommend kindle.However, if you only read Manga or Comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books I do not recommend kindle for you. It is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.So if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!If you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores.
I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too.
Great product for the price. Purchased this for a Christmas exchange and was the most popular item.
I bought this for my husband who just turned 87 and isn't up to date on technology I thought it would be fun to have a direct line to knowledge with voice command
Everything I wanted. Still learning on using her..
The Kindle Paperwhite is lightweight and simple to use! I love my kindle! It looks just like I'm reading a regular book but I don't have to worry about flipping pages I just slide my finger or tap!
Bought it for the grandkids for Christmas. Like the parental controls!
Bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, I love how easily she can just click and download whatever she wants without bugging me for passwords. The 2 year worry free guarantee is also very nice to have since kids will be kids!
Good quality little tablet, great for kids. Locked down and does not run full Android so you cannot use google play store apps.
Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera
Recently bought one of the 8GB models for myself and loved it. The next day, I ordered one for my wife and one for our kids. Easy to use, good battery life and a great price!
It's really a good product to buy for kids. A lot of educational games . They can their favorite kids show from youtube, Netflix etc. The cover is really good. I'm gonna another one for my daughter.
My kid loves this! It was one of his favorite Christmas presents.
I purchased two tablets as Christmas gifts and the children love them.
Upgraded from the fire stick and the picture is noticeably better. The quality and speed of streaming is much quicker.
I had an older Kindle but always had to have a light to read at night. I love the Kindle Paper White...its fantastic!!
I didn't realize what I was missing until I bought one! Love this thing! Makes being in my kitchen so much more pleasant because answers are right at my fingertips! And I have access to so much music! Buying several as Xmas presents!
I got it on black friday. Its a great tablet for Kids or your additional backup tablet for games or reading books. Ad's on the lock screen was annoying.
I have the Kindle Paperwhite from 2013 and my fiance just got the 2015 version. It's great to see added features without a change in price!
This is great to turn an ordinary tv that has an HDMI port into somewhat of a smart tv.
Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system, no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere, not like leaving their other tablets at home, I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable
Love the product. It is amazing for streaming and has wide range of applications. Great Product overall.
I bought one for myself and really liked it.Bought this one for wife, so far shes pleased.perfect size for purse and portability.
My daughter lovethis tablet.. only problem is it cant connect to my home wifi which is verizon
First day after purchasing the tablet the screen turned green. Since then it has given us problems with the screen turning green. I will be returning the item.
Love my new kindle. The backlight is a huge improvement over the previous kindle, but it's not an automatic backlit and must be adjusted by the user depending on the situation. If you're looking for an auto backlight, go for the Kindle Voyage.
The Echo is a great product, it was easy to set up and Alexa was answering questions in no time. There are several basic functions that the Echo is wonderful at: news, weather, music, time and timing. I love playing the Jeopardy game. I think that if I have anything to say on the "down side" it is that I had a higher expectation of the product's ability to search the internet for answers to some of my questions. Lots of my inquiries come back with the answer "I did not understand that question" or "I'm sorry, I do not know the answer." These are only a minor irritation/amusement. Overall, I am pleased with the product. Hopefully I will grow in my knowledge of the product and Echo will also grow in abilities through upgrades.
Wanted a simple tablet and this ended up meeting our expectations.
I bought the kindle paperwhite for my aunt's birthday. She has difficulty reader paper books due to eye problems. Having the back light and ability to make the print larger really has helped her be able to enjoy reading again!!
Really like the echo and has great sound. Just learning Alexa is a bit different.
I purchased two for my grandchildren. They loved it. Reading, games and videos
The fire is one of the easiest E readers/tablets to use. The Amazon interface makes it a true treasure.
The Kindle Paperwhite is great for reading anywhere, even at the beach! You can also read it in bed with the lights out so you don't disturb anyone else. I absolutely love it! I have a Kindle Fire, an iPad, and a Samsung Galaxy 4 and the Kindle Paperwhite is far better than any of those for reading!
My son is very happy with this and so are mommy and daddy. No more asking for our phones and setting the time limit is awesome
If it wasn't for my receiving an e-mail advertisement from Best Buy's weekly deals, I would not have seen Kindle Fire on sale. I have been most pleased and satisfied with the product and the free shipping offer from Best Buy.
We are throughly enjoying our Amazon TV. We first bought the Amazon Stick, but realized we need more space and put the TV in our bonus room. Both have allied us to reduce our cable bill. :)
Wasn't too sure if I wanted to buy the echo or the dot but after using this product I'm very happy that I went with the echo. I find myself using it all the time.
I had got the original for the wife she finally needed a new one so when I saw this online I had to get her a new one she loves it
So much fun to be had with this device! I sound like a dork everyday when I talk to Alexa. Love it!
Great gift idea got it for my father for a Christmas gift
This table is realy nice for starters. This table have lots off free apps. It's easy to use and u can put in an sd card for more space.
Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere!
I purchased the 7" and 8" units at the same time. They are both nice little tablets for using the Amazon apps and cruzing the internet, but the 7" is lacking the additional 512Mb of ram an 8Gb of storage that make the 8" worth the additional money.
Very helpful product helps me with my appointments.
Bought this for my sister. This has replaced her I Pad. She loves it.
Me and the kids love it very user friendly and a fair price
This is by far the best stream box I own. Besides being a premium Amazon memeber makes this even better.
I wanted a cheap tablet to watch movies on. It streams all apps well ( Netflix, YouTube, and others). The only complaint is the internet browser is garbage. I also have a fire tv and 2 fire sticks. Amazon products work well.
It was a Wonderful gift for the holidays, I've enjoyed it greatly!!
Perfect gift! Great apps and reading material. Would buy it again
The bright screen and lightweight design make this ereader ideal for reading in just about any setting.
I had to replace my last Kindle so I made a quick run to Best Buy. Got a great deal and purchased the replacement insurance. Kindle works fine. It is slow and needs to be restarted frequently. Pretty much the same as the last Kindle
got this for my nephew and he loves it. easy to use and has great sounds and picture quality
The Kindle Paperwhite is easy to read in daylight outside is shining as well as in the dark. I no longer need a reading light at night to enjoy my books. The battery lasts several weeks between charges. I would recommend this unit to friends!
This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok
The Alexa device is awesome. The sound quality from the Bluetooth speaker is the best for the price point. Perfect audio quality streaming from phone or from the connect apps. Setup is not that bad!
Great for toddlers and preschoolers. My 3 yr old loves it
A decent tablet. Just wish the app store had some better apps to download.
This was supposed to be my back-up travel type tablet.It has a display that is much better than my bigger tablet.It starts faster.The touch screen is more accurate,.Even at twice the price it would still be a bargain.
So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all...
Alexa has been a very good companion and source of information to anything that she knows...very honest, answers all questions to her own capability.
Purchased for my son's kindle fire , plug in , and get a message that charging will be slow. I bought an OEM fast charger for this exact reason , to be fast , not even slower that a 3rd party.
Bought the Echo for my hubby's birthday, and it is everything I expected. It is so easy to set up, and we enjoy it so much. We use it to play music (such as a certain genre or artist or particular song). The sound quality is very good. My grandkids love to hear their songs too. We use it to make our shopping list, as it's easy to add things whenever you think of them, and no lists to lose! I definitely would recommend the Amazon Echo.
This is an excellent product. It will do everything expected and perform it well. Voice recognition is excellent. Great for people of all ages from 2 years old to 90 or more.
This works well and is a great way to keep up on news. Works well with smart home items.
I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad.
I bought the Amazon Echo as a gift to my niece! Both her and her family love it! It was easily linked to their wi-fi and it was also easily linked to their amazon accounts!! Great gift!
My son requested this a a birthday gift. He is enjoying it everyday.
This box provides a wonderful image on my 4K Samsung TV. The program content is extraordinary. You can install whatever apps your heart desires and see virtually the world.
After having been an Apple TV user (the older versions, of which I have 2) I decided to go with the amazon product because this one supports fox sports. That's the only reason I chose it. But after using it I have no complaints at all. I haven't yet looked into streaming from mobile device to it yet, not sure if it's possible or not. Either way I'd recommend this to anyone looking to buy one of these devices.
Makes life easier. I have several smart home products including nest devices and hue lights. Alexa lets me control them all with my voice. And I don't even have to shout. Even if across the room.
Met all my expectations & more! The amount of skills to select from is good. Can't wait to see what is upcoming.
Amazon Echo is my new favorite , I love Alexia, sound is great. I use timer in kitchen, making list, checking weather where my loved one's live, and stock market.
Great that you can get these in different colors to differentiate from the other one!
You're gonna need this because it doesn't come shipped with the Paperwhite. Great purchase, works perfectly!
Echo is very impressive. Unlimited entertainment. and is pretty decent speaker for music, spotify premium is awesome to use with it.
The echo works great. Every Day I find out more things to use it for.The sound is great for the size. I bought another one for the garage.
I purchased this tablet for my mom for Christmas,and she loves it.She really enjoyed using the Alexa feature.Though I did have to return the first tablet due to some software issues,I had a great customer service experience.There took care of the problem right away,and exchange for a new one. Haven't had any issues with the new replacement tablet.My mom couldn't be happier.The tablet was a wonderful price.Thanks Best Buy
Picked this item up while on sale to control all my NEST & phillips hue lights. Has a much better voice recognition than SIRI
My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch.
I bought this for cousin. She is very happy with this small tablet.
The Echo is very neat & fun to use. Just ask Alexa questions & she will give you the answer!
Best quality around for the low price I play my games for hours
I bought this for my husband for Christmas. Got it for $33..couldn't beat the price. We found this was a greal alternative to pricier tablets and clunkier items such as laptops and Chromebooks, when all you wanted to to is check email or do surfing. Display is great, Definitely recommend
You get what you pay for... This is not great, the functionality and limitations leave much to be desired. Should have spent more and got another Samsung Galaxy Tab.
My son is not gentle and has managed to destroy a few other, more expensive, tablets. I bought this for a fraction of what the other tablets cost and it works great. He loves it.
Sound quality amazing! So much fun! Enjoy it every day!
This is a far better product than the fire stick that I first started out with it is a lot faster at everything it does and it hardly ever buffers. I would recommend to spend the extra money and get the fire tv.
Rather would have the fire stick as it is smaller and cheaper. I feel as though it has the same features.
Another good buy for my daughter! Youngest one too! She enjoys being on it!!
Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value
Great improvement in 4k downloads over regular fire stick on Samsung 4k set
The product is good for children. The downside is, the tablet's charging port will get loose and not function anymore within the first month of use. If you plan on giving this to a child, make sure you take care of charging it for them, dont let them do it on their own, or they will most likely mess up the port even quicker as they are a bit careless.
the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drops frequently and even when it shows its connected can fail to download any data. Perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later SW update but for now I have to say the performance is underwhelming. the Backlight also has some serious bleed issues which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship. The fire 7 HD which i also own has none of these issues. Get what you pay for rings true again.
easy to use.. I am not able to access any music, I am looking forward to getting the lighting package
Good quality tablet that handles all your needs from young to old
Easy to use and has a lot of games and books available. Good memory and you can't beat the price!
Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself.
Great product for the money.This does all and more than some for a great value.
i got this for my daughter as a gift, but after seeing it action, i think i need one for myself. I think its almost like having an assistant.
it is a good product. But does not work well for some cases, for example, user with different noise environment, and different accent. Some times the searched results are funny. Also, hope it support other languages. Also Price too high.
I purchased the tablets as Christmas gift for my nieces. Perfect for them ages 9, 7, and 5. They love reading and this is a viable option when traveling. Instead of movies when riding in the car, they read!
small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
I wasn't sure I could prefer digital books over traditional but I love this reader. Pages are clear and easy to navigate. One of the best purchases I ever made.
I read as many reviews as I could find before buying this newest Paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print. However, when I got mine, I had to put the brightness level to 19 (out of 25) to get it to a comfortable setting. Doing that makes my battery run down before I've even read two books, and that is with the airplane setting on, meaning the WIFI is off. Luckily, I bought a charger so I can charge my Paperwhite while on trips ( without my computer, in a regular outlet) or at night when I'm finished reading. Now for the positives. I love the light weight of this Kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed. I absolutely LOVE the dictionary feature, because it is so easy to use and it saves the words I don't know, for study. After I've learned a word's meaning, I can delete it from the list. I got the Paperwhite with the ads, because it is nice getting suggestions of books I might enjoy that I might not see otherwise. And books are easy to order from the Kindle Store and to download through this devise. I like the cover, because it protects the screen from scratches while stored in my purse and I also purchased a stylus to keep fingerprints off the screen and I like that. Generally, I am happy with this purchase.
We purchased this for our son who starts school next year. This is a great upgrade from his Nabi. My only complaint would be the memory, or lack there of. It is expandable so I highly recommend a micro SD.
The speaker sounds is rich and loud! Even at its loudest Alexa still responds when you call for her. Fast responses and ability to sync with my products is exactly how I want it to work.
Not much new to be said. Beautiful screen, long battery life, great to own if you love to read.
This has exceeded our expectations. We love it and would recommend it!
Great tablet for the price. If you have Amazon prime it's even better
Easy to use for a 5 year old. She loves it. I just don't like that my amazon account is linked to her tablet.
So far, i am enjoying my Echo. I have used it so far to play songs from Pandora, wake me up in the morning. tell me the weather and as a timer. Looking forward to learning lots more things it can do.
Although this tablet is slower than my iPad Air, it works great and keeps a charge all day! It is great value!
Minimum setup required.Glossary of terms is somewhat limited.Design is attractive and fits into any dcor.Sound is good (not Bose, but acceptable)Easy to add features (calendar, To Do List, reminders, etc.
Got this for my 9 year old for Christmas and he loves it light weight and its able to do so much
Easy setup, so convenient, don't leave home without it
Bought the device as a gift for someone and so can't comment on the usage, however it was a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me.
I initially read e-books on my old Kindle that needed a light. I then migrated to using my mini iPad with a kindle app. The brightness bothered my eyes and outside it was pretty useless. I bought the paper white as it has a backlight that isn't too strong. Love it!
I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth.
My 5 year old grandson really enjoys his new tablet. He's had it for several months. The only negative I see is the charge port is starting to get loose. The small plug is maybe not robust enough for a 5 year old.
The entire family enjoys this product. Provides music, weather, timer and viirtually anything you need to know. Great product!
If you are looking for an entry level tablet, this is it.The Kindle fire HD is perfect for kids!
I absolutely love my fire tv it is amazing for everything
I liked this item. You will too. Inexpensive. Purchased for son
Build quality-- very impressive, this is not a cheap feeling device. it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling.
I love Amazon Echo with Alexa. It can answer any question. The only downside is that it cannot play ITunes music. I'm hoping Amazon will change that in the near future.
Excellent product. The screen is very easy to read and can access movies, books, and ,more. Was given as a gift to my mother and she loves it.
This Firebox allows you to upgrade memory to store content.I love how it has alexa on it.
I have loved Amazon's Kindles from the start. Everything is user friendly and Amazon's customer service can't be beat!
Only those who have an Amazon account can work with this tablet
Bought this for our 8 year old for Christmas. Looks like he's going to love it!
I currently own 3 Kindles, including this one, so I am very familiar with the Kindle Fire tablets. I love that this new Fire has updated the look and feel. I can add a memory card to download books, movies, photos and games on so I can take them with me when I'm on the go and don't picture, which I love! So for $50, it's a great value. There are only 2 things that I wish this Kindle had: there is no sleep/wake function and it doesn't have the micro hdmi port to connect it to my TV, but again, for the price it's a great product.
Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
Being its were on sale I bought it after use I found Excelent
My son loves it. Very easy to use. Great price and value.
Must have device..... having movies in 4K is great
was able to transfer all books over and like the size of the kindle
I use it for listening to music when I'm trying to study. I use it to catch me up on news and also to turn off my lights. Great personal assistant wish it supported more applications/phone integration.
Very nice matte screen that's easy on the eyes. If you want a eBook reader this is the best one
My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
Overall a good tablet. The screen is crisp enough to enjoy videos. The only downside is the built in speakers. Even with headphones, the sound quality isn't top notch. Just average. If you're not looking to do anything fancy. It's a good deal.
it didn't work I had to return it after Christmas and buy something else, made for a wonderful Christmas mourning
For the price, it's a decent tablet. They way they get the price down is to psuh ads to your device. You can pay $15 to get the ads removed. Overall it's a good tablet.
This is very nice for a little over 100.00 dollars. It took a bit to get use to after using a iPad. I got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight.
Never have a problem with my kindle fire got 4 of them
I waited to buy this product, to see what the reviews would have to say over time. They were mostly upbeat, and I am an Amazon Prime member. So, I said, "What the heck," and gave the Echo a shot. I am glad I did. I use it to listen to music and news intermittently throughout the night while sleeping. I enjoy the Sports Update and the Flash Briefing. I also like that I can simply ask to stream most any radio station, and listen to the latest episode of my favorite pod casts. Echo is very responsive to my voice commands. This product is easily worth every penny you spend on it.
Like the fact that it is strictly an e-reader. Wished it was a bit larger like the Fire HD 8 tablet - but pleased with my purchase
The echo has been fun for the whole family. It plays music and interacts with everyone and the outcome is very entertaining
I have the fire stick and now the box. Highly recommend.
Really neat little device! We were an Apple only ecosystem family but Alexa is fitting in just fine. We used it for listening to music and getting the weather mostly but have since discovered the skills that can be enable through the Alexa app. We already had a harmony hub and with a little setup after enabling the harmony skill we can now control our home entertainment devices with our voice such as "Alexa, turn on Apple TV".
I seriously wonder why it took me to get FireTV for so long. I originally had a Roku XS and then I stupidly bought a Roku 4. Both devices were all right but neither could handle 5.1 audio from Netflix on my Vizio sound bar (essentially your device must be cable of handling Dolby Digital Plus and nothing less using Roku). I finally decided to give FireTV a try and I'm amazed. Not only does it convert DD+ to DD on Netflix and HBO Go, I can install XBMC (Kodi) on it! I wish I knew about this before I bought my Roku 4 and HTPC. I now literally have no use for my HTPC anymore... FireTV can handle EVERYTHING now and all with DD and DTS 5.1 audio. Even better, I have a ton of smart devices and 3 Echos... I can now control all of these devices directly from the remote. This is seriously one of the best purchases I have made in the past year.
Love that my whole family can use this for anything from sling to Amazon prime to gaming
love it nice and clean powerful tv box fast shipping from best buy all the time
The Kindle Fire was extremely easy to set up. It is user friendly and its size is great. It fits in my purse so I can have it with me when I need it.
It would be better if it had an additional out-put or could be wirelessly linked to another device or speakers. Additionally, it would be nice if it could make calls.
Easy to get started with usefulFeatures. As I learn of new skills and try them Alexa gets more entertaining. Efficient and helpful assistant.
Does all it claim, not yet using much except for music
I really like the kindle. It so much easier to care around to read.
This is a very capable player. It is comparable to the Roku 4 or AppleTV. There are a few caveats though. The device works best if you have Amazon account, preferably an Amazon Prime account. It allows you to access the Amazon Video library, download apps, and use Alexa voice search. Unfortunately, there is an additional annual fee for the service. There is a free option, but it limits the ability of the device. The device also lacks true YouTube support. You're redirected to a website like interface to view videos. With YouTube beginning to roll out 4K content, it makes you wonder why this device doesn't have a dedicated YouTube app to showcase the 4K ability. If you have an Amazon Prime account, this device works very well. Otherwise, I would recommend doing some research, such as looking at the Roku 4, which has a more well-rounded set of features.
These are the best you can get! I have bought 2 already
Great tablet for the price, it was a Christmas present and so far so good!
Alexa thats all you need the voice command is amazing. Looking for shows or browsing
So this is my second fire tv and just like my first one I love this one just as much. My advice is you are debating between the fire stick or the fire tv pay the extra money and get the fire tv.
Fast enough to play videos and movies . Also esay to install
i upgraded from an older kindle that wasn't backlit. The quality and ease of use is much better and I love the backlit feature!
Gifted to kid and they liked it. Screen resolution is not great but sufficient
Wire TV works perfect if you want all of your steaming in one place.
The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !!
Table overall was ok but after 30 days it wouldn't work, and there was no warranty after 30 for Best Buy so I just waste 30 for nothing
Absolutely loving my Amazon Echo..."Alexa"Don't know how I lived without her for so long! Shehelps me cook dinner...always a joke to tell...and keeps track ofmy shopping list..to do list...and a whole lot more!
overall good but voice control does not work yet. support is not easily obtained to resolve the issue - it still does not work
Purchased as a reward for perfect attendance for middle school students. This was just what we (and they) wanted.
I've hooked it up but just haven't signed up for the service yet, So we'll see.
Great and easy read especially when outside in the sun.
We both got one and we enjoy it very much!! We both can read our books and play games it's great for traveling too. Have no complaints here.
Its a nice product to use, very light and a long battery life.
I bought this tablet for my children. It is great and comes with parental controls. I would highly recommend this tablet.
Works well for the purpose it was used for not fancy but good quality tablet
I received this as a birthday present and have really been enjoying it. Easy voice interface allow you to talk directly to the Echo to listen to news, music weather. Set up was easy with an IPhone, just follow the steps in the instructions and your off. Amazon is also creating other way to interface with the Echo through home automation. If you have one of the Logitech Harmony home Ultimate remotes with the hub then you can use voice commands through the Echo to launch activities. I really enjoy this Echo!!
Our youngest grandson loves his kindle fire. He loves reading his books and playing Minecraft as well as other games. A great started tablet!
I broke my Kindle Voyage after almost two years. My heart was as broken as the glass cover!After looking at the latest line of Kindles I decided to try the latest Paperwhite as it had the same screen resolution and was a lot cheaper. Plus, a white model to match my other white/silver gadgets! It does have a few less LEDs for backlighting, no flush glass cover (but that is what broke), no auto-adjusting light (that never quite worked anyway), squeezy sides, and a tiny bit heavier/bigger than the Voyage. The Voyage also has had no hardware updates since it was released and the new crazy-expensive Kindle uses leather and has no not-leather option for people who don't like their high tech wrapped in animal skins. So instead of saving up for a while and reading on my phone, I sprung for the Paperwhite.I've been using this for about a month and the quality has impressed me. I don't miss the glass cover as much as I thought I would, although sometimes pet hair will get caught between the bezel and the screen and need to be pulled out. The screen is great, doesn't clash with the white casing, and although not quite as even a backlight as the Voyage, still much better value for what you get. The software is essentially the same, and Amazon has been slowly improving Kindle software for all the recent models.If you like Amazon for books, I highly recommend this Kindle. You can't beat it for price/value and it really doesn't feel any heavier even after an hour or two curled up with your books.
This product is amazing. I am electronically challenged, but can use this item, maybe not to its fullest potential, but I am learning!!
Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability.
bought this tablet for my 70 yr mom. so far she is enjoying it and having no issues. it is her first one and she is finding it easy to use and learn new things.
Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane
Easy to set up parental controls and email notification are a great tool on the tablet
Great Item...lots of fun .HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
I bought this tablet for my husband to download books, play games, and surf the Internet. I wasn't sure he would like a tablet and this was a good, inexpensive trial tablet. He really enjoys it.
My children like to read and they wanted something they could have books on. This tablet allows for games as well without having the need to spend hundreds. It does the job for highschool.
I would highly recommend this as a beginner tablet.
I love it!!! This is the best speaker for the average couch potato or lazy person! I can tell her to play my favorite pandora stations or set alarms without lifting a finger! I can even ask if it'll rain today so I know if I should bring an umbrella! Great buy!!!
Works. You must have the unit hard wired to your network to get the unit to sync with your phone or tablet so they can be used as a remote.
This is a nice basic tablet for those not wanting to spend a lot of $$. Easy to use, nice HD resolution for games and even watching Netflix etc.
Works great in the sun. Only complaint is that it scratches easily.
Overall the Amazon echo Alexa is a phenomenal product but will grow much more with time. There are a few issues but that's to be expected!
Works great. I got this because using the smart tv features on my smart tv didn't stream video very reliably. This does.
I bought this Kindle for my 14-yr old daughter, Kennedy. She hates it so it's now mine! I love how small it is-fits in my handbag perfectly!
Bought for the grandkids and they work great might get one for myself
The view is so clear & much more enjoyable than the prevoius model.
Daughter uses at college. She has a need for books to be read to her and this Kindle does this. It is GREAT!
I'm amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and I recommend it
There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
awesome little device, I had an apple tv before, this fire stick does the same thing and more for cheaper
Bought this as a gift for my family, mainly to play music from Amazon. Very pleased with how easy it is to set up and use.
Bought this for an Xmas present for my 7 yr old with the monthly program through Amazon he has access to age appropriate books, videos, games love that he is not able to play something that is not in his age group.
Great products as usual and great customer service
I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!!
It is Great. I use it all the time easy to use great product
Pretty basic tablet that suits me since im not really looking for something to do with it other than play or browse the internet
Best hands free speaker for a beginner. My daughter loves it.
My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them.
I was very surprised by the quality and speed of this tablet, since it was only $40! I would highly recommend. Good for kids too - don't spend the extra money for the kid version, just buy them this one.
I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.
I like this tablet for the price I paid it is easy to use, setup, and I like the way it looks.
I love this product and that you can take "Alexa" everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker. You can connect it to your phone when away from a WiFi building. The speaker is great, it is surrounded by cloth, which I would worry about it getting dirty. The one downside to the tap compared to the Echo Dot or the OG Echo is that Alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the Tap, you have to press the speaker button. Pretty self explanatory name. You have to "tap" the tap. I ended up returning it to get the dot. But, like I said, great speaker, great portable device.
This is 3rd Amazon reader I bought, plus several Fire sticks and Fire TV. All those devices are making my life nicer and helping to enjoy it. The reader is just great - a lot of flexible settings, support of many electronic book formats, possibility to read even in dark - what else do you need?
Alexa is a great product. She seems to know everything, whether its math, music,sports, it just doesn't matter. I think my wife is jealous of her because I spend too much time with her(Alexa).
Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.
I am using my second kindle and this third one was a gift for my 83 year old mother in law, very user friendly
One of the best things that I have purchased for my home entertainment
It's a good addition to the gadgets. Alexa helps manage shopping lists, connects to phone using Bluetooth to play music apart from the music on Amazon Prime. Alexa has a pretty good collection of jokes and can keep kids at home entertained.I plan on purchasing Hue range of lights that can be controlled using Echo soon.
Our grand kids really love this tablet and it has a lot of app options.
I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages.
I use it mainly for sling but I do so much more with it and I love the remote that I can speak to Alexa
I bought this for my mother during Mother's Day and I got a $10 off.Overall I paid around $42 for the tablet. Best tablet money can buy. It includes YouTube,Pandora and all the other good apps you get on a normal cell phone. I bought other cheap tablets on the past for a much higher price and less the quality.
Have had it for a couple of weeks and really enjoy being able to call up music and have it play without having to go through my phone.
I bought These for my kids, they like playing games on it. My only complaint is they take hours to charge.
Small and useful has an expandable memory. Very user friendly !
My son loves his kindle. It is a great device. Our only problem is switching from internal memory to the memory card we put in it. It's not as easy to do as I would like.
Got this for a great deal during Black Friday sale for my small children. I already have Amazon Prime so I get all their shows & movies streaming on the tablet. A great kids' babysitter for one-time cost of $33.
This is a very nice tablet for my GF who has never had one before.
My family loves our Amazon Echo and Alexa. She is used mostly for playing just about any song available, as well as weather reports, creating shopping and ToDo lists, and learning bits of trivia too.
Every app that I needed with no problems. No other app runs as well for the price.
Great , must own it and I love it so much. Good deal.
Great sound quality, and with Amazon Prime, great selection. Of music.
This cute little tablet has all the great features of an iPad mini plus more. Great for kids and adults!
I will try again for the 3rd time with my new Amazon Fire. It seems to have nice upgrades.
It does exactly what I bought it for and more. Worth every penny
This was neat at first, when I could stream music and goof around with it. Once I delved into the smart home controls, this went from neat to amazing. I can now tell Alexa Go to Bed and the lights downstairs go out, the TV goes off, the door locks and it can even adjust the thermostat. This is truly the easiest home automation device out there!
I had the 1st Kindle, but this one is much better!
Great tablet for my kid. Great price great performance
We bought one for one of my kids for their birthday and his brother liked it so much that he bought himself one with his birthday money.
Not knowing much about the fire tv I did my research and when I got it home it was even better than I expected!
I have recently purchased a home, and I have been set on a mission to make my home as connected as possible. Finding the right product lineup has been interesting.However, the Alexa product was a no brainer. In our house we are Amazon Prime members, so we can take advantage of the music and 2-day shipping orders from Alexa. These are after thoughts, as I bought Alexa to control my smart home setup with my voice.Many believe you can just buy Alexa and control your home. This is not the case. You can use Alexa as a smart home hub with WeMo products, but this uses Wifi and the devices easily connect and disconnect throughout the day if not setup properly.In my setup, I have a Wink hub connected to z-wave products around the home. Wink can also connect to online services like Google's Nest Services and Chamberlin MyQ garage, but unfortunately they are not able to be directly controlled by Alexa for the Wink Hub.With that being said, for Z-Wave and Zigbee products, I can tell Alexa to turn on and off these products. As well as, if setup with a dimmer, what percentage to set them at. Often times this is quicker than the Wink app itself.Pros:Wink Compatible.Logitech Harmony Hub Compatible.Nest Compatible.IFTTT Compatible.Can read Audible Audio Books.Sound from speaker can fill a fair sized family room.Makes home automation more intelligent.Cons:Sometimes doesn't respond appropriately.Price is a bit high.To summarize, the Alexa functionality of this product is limited. Unless you have Amazon Prime or devices that can attach to it, using its enabled skills. Would recommend as an accessory to a smart home, or for someone invested in the Amazon Eco System.
bought for my 5 yr old. He cant put it down. lots of educational apps.
I purchased this tablet on a whim and it was the best decision I ever made. It is easy to use and so much fun!!
Purchased for a child as a first tablet. Coupled with the price, it's a good introductory option for streaming media and playing games.
We purchased 2 ... one for each grandson so they can watch movies and play games. Like the parental controls. That was very important to us.
nice product
I like the e-reader on here plus I have all the apps as well
The screen quality is excellent, and while not all android apps are available for the Fire, a vast number are. The batter life is very good and the responsiveness for the apps that I use is wonderful. my number one negative is it's continued use of the old industry standard USB cord and socket for charging. My wife often uses the tablet while it is plugged in, which leads to damage to the socket and the connector. This intern will lead to a third rate connection and the eventual inability to charge the device. I'm hoping that the new standard (USB C) will fix this problem in the future. For now, don't use the tablet (or any tablet) while it is plugged in!
It's everything you can ask for in a tablet. The only downfall was the camera, but at a price like that, you get what you pay for.
Works really well have no complaints about this product, I would recommend this product to anyone who ask
Kept my kids busy on road trip & while I cook daily
This Kindle Fire provides the portability that I was looking for.
Best thing invented. Love my Amazon stick, everyone should have one.
And this works perfect!! Kindle does not fail!! You will def. get your money worth with this e-reader
you can not fail on Amazon. I primarily use for reading books and watching prime video without any problem. Love this little thing!
We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
I've had the old kindle 7, but love this one more. It's a little smaller so it's easier to hold while using it. Great for playing on apps, checking stuff online, and reading books. Easy to travel which I love
With these being on sale for $33, we couldn't pass up the deal. These tabletd are perfect for younger kids.
I bought this as a gift. I think it is pretty decent both quality and design.
The Amazon fire tablet is a great gift for kids of all ages . Ez and fun to use keeping kids entertained while giving them educational tools to use at their grade level and hire.
Bought for my elderly parents and they love it, best ever
Purchased this to use during my travels so that I'm not confined to what is available to me from others. I connect to the hot spot on my phone and I am all set!
I love my tablet. It is super easy and loads fast.
Needed something to use when out and about and this was perfect
While it seemed to work fine, the Tap does not have the open mic feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with Alexa, which seems to defeat the purpose.
I just love this product can't wait to add to it and be able to turn on and off lights.
We are very happy with our purchase. We use Alexa everyday for various things and really enjoy playing jeorardy.
Great performance for the money, however if you are looking to read in bright sunlight it is not ideal.
This is the perfect portable device. I believe it to be much better then IPad or in my opinion rivals it.
Bought this for my son to use and he loves it. I did the initial setup which was easy since we have an Amazon account. Otherwise there's a ton of free games using Amazon underground.
Works great, easy to use. Affordable, worth the cost.
Didn't know you had to buy space and many other things for this item to work.
Have only been using the Amazon TV for a few months now and so far have been very satisfied. Simple to use, it walks you through the setup and provides access to lots of apps and streaming video services.
He loves the games, that he can down loaded boos, music and videos.
What's not to love about this item - You'll need a smartphone to set this up (app based) - and then the sky is the limit (we control lights, temp and a few other things in the house as well as listen to music via spotify)I love these items - Speaker is decent (I'm used to bose, denon, etc for sound) so given the size of the echo - the sound output and quality is below that of my BOSE 123 (but it cost lots less and is much more functional)
I really wanted to buy this kindle paperwhite and I can't be happier. I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting for a e-book reader. Really nice product really love it!
The tablet is very user friendly for my mom who is not very computer savvy.
Purchased for a friends 3 year old. The parental controls are great and the price was more than reasonable for this kind of gift.
My grandson needed a new tablet. He had a Nabi for the last two years and had reached it's limit regarding storage. I found this tablet and decided I was the perfect choice because of the great price, memory, and it comes with a "kid proof" case.
I love the echo but you need one in every room to control things from everywhere in a big house. The speaker accessory to put in other rooms is only available through Amazon and is still on back order.
Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference.
This is a great product. It works great and is fun to use.
My kids read books play games take pictures they love this.
Great sales support. Called store beforehand and held product for pick up the same day.
This is a great device for book readers! It's larger than the former kindle, has great light and easy to operate.
Easy to hold, access to some free games - just be careful if you have 1-click payment option. My 3 year old charged $16 to my account in 3 days. Good news - I received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. She loves the "FIRE"
Excellent device. Light weight and easy on eyes. Next time I'll get a black one instead of the white to minimize glare in sunlight.
I previously owned the larger hd fire 8.9 kindle and loved it. I wanted a smaller tablet to fit in my purse so this was perfect. I love the color. It holds a ton of books and you can add a sd card for extra space.
Great tablet for the price. However the battery drains quickly
I highly recommenf the new Paperwhite kindle. Such great reading anywhere!!!
Love my new Alexa. Sooo easy to use and so many apps to program for her. The best purchase I've made in a very long time!
Fabulous new functionality love the night reading capabilities
We have 3 Kindles, all paper white models. They are lighter than the original model with the light on a spring. Both my grandson and I have iPads which we use for internet etc. The Kindles are the best for reading which helps encourage young readers.
This is a good device. Everything works the way it should.
Great tool for streaming, HD is awesome and sound is to, only wish it had ability to stream from USB stick or external HDD.
I bought the Fire as a gift for a friend who loves to play games. This is the perfect size and functions well for his purpose and more. This is a great tablet for the price!
It has a very nice screen to read ebook, and once it is charged, it can work several days.
This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies!
I've use the Amazon fire tv and the Roku. The Amazon fire box In my opinion is easier to use and I prefer the Amazon remote over the Roku. The only problem I've had with Amazon fire would be the life of the batteries in the remote.
Love this tablet, great value, come with great protective case, preloaded apps are an awesome feature. The included 2 year protection is also a plus.
Amazon Fire tablet has been working well. It seems to hold battery charge reasonably well. It wouldn't be great for the youngest kids due to all the amazon product advertisements, but great for him.
I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount
I have two of these and four Fire Sticks. They are great for accessing Amazon content and any of your other favorite streaming apps/games. With a moderate Internet speed there is virtually no delay for programming to start. Alexa remote is handy so you can quickly search.
This is a great product for watching movies especially if you're tired of paying those high cable prices.
Gave this one as a gift. Never had any problems with mine.
The Echo is fun and informative...but it does not have the capabilities of Siri. They say it's a work in progress, we shall see. The voice recognition is ok but it does take multiple tries sometimes.
I saw a one day sale on this Amazon echo and was planning to buy apples version in December, but many review on this echo were above par . Speaker sounds great and Alexa wakes up easy or stops when yo command so. Alexa still has a lot to learn cause.she stumble across some geological questions . Overall satisfied and I plan on integrating Other smart devices with echo. Great Best Buy sale .I only wish Best Buy would have sent email stating order was ready , I told a potshot at going there 2 hrs later but was.at the customer pickup , so I didn't waste the drive .
I like this tablet. I am still figuring out some of the options available on it.
Bought as a gift for in-laws, had some issues setting up as their router was through AT&T. No fault of Alexa, but took a while to fix. Good quality speaker and fun to ask Alexa questions.
Amazon Tap pretty much works as advertised, and understand that the product will evolve with system updates. Love how the weather, traffic, movies and sports scores/schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly. This was an excellent gift as I gave it to both my son and daughter and my son, unknowingly gave we a Tap back as well. Can't wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming
Great buy for the price on Black Friday!!! My Daughter will be happy!
Good for the kids and it works for playing games and reading. Exactly what I needed it for. Very happy.
Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games
I used to avoid dragging along books/magazines to read as they are bulky and heavy, but now I don't need to. I just download my reading material.
Very hard to setup, but once thats done it works remarkably well.
Gone are the days of spending 600 on an iPad! Thank you Amazon!
It is easy for my senior citizen parent to use! Got for her as a gift.
Surpassed my expectations it charges faster than the one that comes with kindle fire when new. So I would purchase another if I ever need a new one.
you might find it somewhat short on available apps. My wife has an Android (Samsung) that is quite deep in app selection. That is not to say you can't find suitable choices. Every machine has it's qwerks and the Kindle starts up when you plug it in to charge. Unnecessary. Overall the 10" is great viewing, especially for the older eyes.
We have several Alexa units throughout our home and love the way it will control lights, TV, and Thermostats.
so much better than my 3 year Fire for versatility.
A very nice tablet for the price. It has everything the more expensive tablets offer. One thing is not so pleasant, the advertisement screen keeps popping up and I so far could not find a way of shutting this function down. However, overall I am satisfied.
Love the tablet. It's easy to watch your favorite shows
At an affordable rate. I am thrilled with the purchase fir my son
I purchased this to watch PlayStation Vue which it does very well. It is relatively small and does to make any noise that I can detect.
Most tablets i've tried really stink, but this one is ok. Wish it had google though.
I bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughters. Great item and just as nice as the more expensive one. She absolutely loves it.
I love the Amazon fire TVEasy to set up and easy to use
This is a great item!!! You can ask her basically anything and she will let you know the answer. Even How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
I debated between the tap and echo, and this went on sale just before Xmas for such a great price at Best Buy. That helped to make up my mind pretty quickly!
Would like to be able to delete items to make room for more things I do want but otherwise I enjoy it very much. Easy to take anywhere
This thing is pretty awesome. Thank you for the fast shipping
very thin and portable.. If i've read more i would use it
We use this all the time. It is great for information and music
We love this device it controls the lights in home
I love its skills. Plays music, Smarthouse features, spells words, etc.
I love my new paper white kindle. I have had it a little over a month now. I have had other kindles before, including the Kindle fire. But this new paper white one is the best I have had so far! I love the ability to read it outside, no matter how sunny it is. There is absolutely no glare.This kindle is super light-weight--I carry it in my purse all of the time.This kindle also has an amazing back-light so I can read when it is is dark out.Definitely worth 5 stars!!
I love Amazon Fire tv. It works well because it offers the Fox News and my shows I like on PS Vue
Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
Apple exceeds in all areas minus 4K. Tough decision but if I had to choose again I would opt for the new Apple TV.
Kids love playing with it. We use it for netflix and for basic games
Love it the size easy to carry and store would recommend to others
Bought this for a Christmas gift for my mom I thinks she will like it
This was a gift for my daughter and her first tablet. She likes it and is Learning how to use it with the help of her son.It is easy to handle and the size is easy to carry with her.
First off the tablet is $50 so don't go in expecting it to be on par with the latest iPad. For the price you pay though, you get a really good tablet. Screen is a little lower than 720p, but you have access to all of the Kindle books, Amazon Prime, the new Fire OS, which looks alot better than the "all black" on the last few Kindle Fire's. This model is only 8gb but storage is expandable, I have a 64gb Micro SD in my tablet. Recommended.
Purchased product to stream and it appears to be working well.
I love it so and so my kids.They r enjoying playing the educational games, and watching cartoons.
I appreciate the ease of use and the flexibility of the FIRE. Also its portability.
It was what i needed all this time and i really recommend it for anyone
Excellent tablet for my grandkids. Durable. Awsome 2 year free replacement if damaged for any reason
This is a great tablet for the price! Purchased for my 10 year old son. He uses to play games, watch movies, read books - pretty much anything. Picture is good too.
Great product, excellent packaging, easy to use. Works my connected home well, however voice control gets some getting used to.
I own one and gave this as a gift.Nice interactive gift.
For the most part, this is a great little streamer. It has most of the apps that I need. Big exception is Xfinity support. I can't run any Xfinity apps from it, and I assume that I cannot run HBO GO because of that. Otherwise, It's fast and easy to use. Love the talking remote.
Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of "Alexia".
my husband loves this gift I bought this for Christmas
Nice tablet , does everything i need and easy to use.
Overall the tablet is okay, I just paid 50$ so can't complain anything about specs but the fact that you can't use google services sucks. No google, no youtube, gmail!
Based on the price it is easy to see that this tablet is not something that will knock your socks off but is good for children that like to read books.
Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use.
Alexa is handy and a lot smarter than I thought it would be. I can also see it being used for homework for the answer and not the formula. We can't stop that. Nice addition to the living room.
Connected to WiFi with no issues. Streaming is smooth and error free. Good alternative and being an Amazon Prime member a lot of things are free.
My husband and I have totally enjoyed owning these Amazon Fire tablets. They are so much easier on the eyes than our iphones!
This new version of the amazon tv is awesome. Pretty easy to use.
Fits its purpose as a book reader, but the touch screen could be smoother though.
This is a good tablet option for the price. It works well and is a good reader
Bought for my son and he loves it. Fast and great for playing games
This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers!
Very easy to travel with. Easy to see in dark/dim light
I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.
Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size
Purchased two at Christmas for my niece and nephew. They love them. They're safe for kids to use and easy. The only thing I dislike is the lack of control because of the fire software versus Android, but it's all good.
Although faster than the stick and smart tv apps, it still needs more on stability and better connection for everyday use. Mot worth it if it was more expensive. Still ok.
Git this tablet for my daughter. She is loving it!
We bought 3 fire tablets for Christmas. The kids loved them. It was a perfect gift to give.
its very easy to set up and use. love to take it with me . screen its large enough to read easy on it
Bought it for my son and for now is working great, hope this one last longer than the others, my son loves it, can play, can watch movies, music, etc.
Sound quality is it's best feature. Volume can go up fairly high as well.
Love it's portability and and sound love all my Amazon echo items
Nothing is ever perfect. I'm sure my product has some flaws in it, which I'm okay with. As long as they don't effect the usage I'm happy. Sometimes takes a second to register me pushing the letters, but nothing too big.
I read the reviews online before purchasing and this product is for real Excellent.
Decent screen, kinda slow response on the touch screen.
Kindle Paperwhite strikes a nice balance between features and price. Amazon offers the best store for eBooks period. If you are looking to bring your reading hobby to the 21st century, you cannot go wrong.
Fun, to work on new task and ask random questions.
This device is wonderful and very handy. I really like this very much.
This imy 3rd kindle device.I chose it becazuse it haf more memory/stoeage
This adapter helps free up computer ports so that charging my kindle is not in my way.
After breaking an iPad, this was a perfect cheaper alternative for my toddler.
First Ereader ever bought and it has been one of the best purchases ever. Have had no problems with it and it genuinely feel like you're reading a paperback book. 10 out of 10 would recommend
This was given as a gift. The recipient is thoroughly happy. It is something he has wanted for awhile, mostly because his siblings have one too.
This was my brother's first laptop and he loves it.
I love Alexa! She is so helpful to have in my everyday life, and so entertaining too. And I love her smart home connections; I can control my smart home with my voice through her. My only complaint is that you can't give her two commands at once, but it's easy enough to separate the commands.
This actually was a Christmas present for my Mother, but I had to set it up. This is a nice upgrade from her Kindle purchased three years ago. Kindle was great assisting getting it registered since neither of us could remember her password.
I would totally recommend purchasing Amazon Fire TV! I have enjoyed the simplicity of use and the app I was wanting Plex ! Best Buy had the best price for it so I purchased it from there local store!
The Amazon Fire offers the same access to online resources as the much more expensive IPad and functions just as well.
I love the Amazon Echo. Can use it for a lot of stuff. Love it.
I was looking for something easy to use if I didn't want to go on the computer and for 50$ this is great
I love it.....................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i bought 2 as gifts, but i had a chance to use one of them, and it is great, probably as good if not better than apple tv, and I currently have an apple tv in my house. The music app alone is worth the price. And the set up was very easy. I am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom. It does not come with he HDMI cable, and that would be an extra $15, maybe cheaper depending where and the length you get, but it is still cheaper than an apple TV.
This thing does everything and only 49 bucks I use it everyday
I am enjoying this product very much. great buy!!!
Has greT sound quality. And picks up my voice from the other room.
Love this product ! It is an awesome deviceThank you for selling this at a good price
its ok, u have to buy all the subscriptions and sometimes half of them just buffer the whole time, I have very fast internet and its wired so idk whats up with it.
My first purchasing an Amazon product I was very thrilled with the pricing and availabilty.
It's slippery u cannot hold it it always slips and lots of ads definitely not good if u don't like advertising
Gives me access to all the streaming apps I use and easy to move from room to room
excellent product for an ereader, very user friendly
Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need.
Very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selections online. It sounds very good for it's size.
Works well in sunlight I love it! No pesky ads love it
Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime.
Original purchase for Amazon Fire HD 8 32 GB model put on backorder and cancelled by local Elk Grove CA Best Buy store. Purchased Amazon Fire HD 8 16 GB model from local Best Buy store. A total of $29.99 Sales Tax, Fees & Surcharges were not returned from original Order Number: BBY01-800223005180. Why was the $29.99 not returned? The Amazon Fire HD 8 16 GB (6th Generation) works good.
Very cool to be able to give voice instructions and get news and music via voice. Works great
Have 2 younger kids always trying to grab my cell or tablets for stuff. Grabbed up 2 of these and was pleasantly surprised. Hold charge well, durable, and perfect for kids and learning apps
I bought three of these for my kids ages 7 to 14 and it works great for what they use them for. My only wish is that it came with Google Play Store but we were able to install that separately and works well.
Upgraded from 1st generation Fire tablet. Decided to go with 16GB tablet and there were none in store so I had to order for free delivery to store. Arrived on day promised. Was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. Very nice picture and video. Great value.
Purchase this kindle fo your child and they will LOVE you! Seriously!
I have tried numerous Media Streaming Devices, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. This particular steamer offers a solid combination of hardware, apps, settings and tweeks, as well as expansion options and upgrades all for a reasonable price. You can obviously stream media from the Internet but you can also play games, stream live TV, watch 4K content, add USB and/or SD storage for expansion and off-line access, connect a USB and/or Bluetooth keyboard/mouse/joystick for enhanced interaction, connect Bluetooth headphones or speaker(s) for added listening options, and more! Unless you're looking for a specific advanced feature or functionality, the Amazon Fire TV provides a solid overall Media Streaming experience!
For a tablet, good price and functions. Was tired of working a lot on smart phone. This is a good substitute. Will even order books.
This solved the problem of my daughter's lost kindle charger.
Lots of Fun!! Useful for New, Weather and Alarms - Great Speakfor for the size - Easy to Set up
This is probably my favorite device in my home. Whether you only want this for music playing or if you want to make an awesome voice activated home automation system, do not go with any other brand. Alexa is amazing.
Amazing value for money tablet !!!Best in this price point.Got it for 39$ on sale from Brst Buy.Solid built and quite a rugged product.
It is a very neat product. Can be frustrating at times when trying to control smart home devices. Have patience when learning new devices.
One of the first steps in to my smart home, so far i love them. Only bad is when the AWS servers go down my connected devices wont talk with alexa.
Bought for my youngest daughter. She loves it. Will buy again.
I recommend this item and it works great. Go for it.
makes me fell in love with reading again. I had an old version, the 4th generation and I didn't expect too much change with the new one. But in fact, it did make me feel total differently. The screen is much more exquisite, the whole materials is not that plastic feel any more. I just love it. The only regret is that, a few days after my made the purchase, there is the $10 saving promotion...
Great entertainment,easy to use,very affordable,great education.
I enjoy it had one before It's wonderful I I read my book's on it and play games.
We wanted something you could read books on and watch shows through amazon and hulu. This meets those needs and then some.
I am loving my new kindle fire! It is so easy to use, and downloading is a breeze! The connectivity is great also
It is very good for kids who are looking for reasonable cost.
I wore out my first generation paperwhite......onto the next! Kindle paperwhites are the way to go!
My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.
Great tablet. Very reliable. Only problem was the ads. But they didn't bother me too much. Overall a great buy.
It's worth the purchase. I use it every morning getting ready
I am no stranger to amazon tablet a must have, for the budget buyer can't go wrong :)
Love it. I would recommend to anyone who like streaming tv.
I bought two one for my 5 year old and one for my grandmother. So easy to use, and they love it. Will buy more
The Amazon Echo is a great product. It has many skills that can be addedand is very easy to set up. The voice control feature works very well and the Echo has great sound.
Great companion to any laptop, and an excellent reader+. Amazon Prime membership can enhance the overall ease of use.
This product is very good. There was no problems in moving all of my books from my other Kindle to this one. I like the touch active screen and the lite screen. The size makes it easier to travel.
the reason i purchase the item because she love to watch movies on her phone.
If you like movies it's worth it. Had to have a friend help us set it up but it works great
Exactly what was expected, easy to read, portable, good battery life. Has adds which are annoying but do not interfere with reading. Not idea for reading Manga or comics but works well enough.
..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode.
Granddaughter loves it these was her upgrade for her birthday
I like the tablet. The only negative is that google apps don't work, but for the money, I don't really care that much. I mostly just use it to read
We purchased 3 of these for our kids and they love them.
I am so glad I purchased the Paperwhite. It makes reading better at night because of little glare and dimmer than my Fire or Ipad. Was finding it hard to justify buying it but I'm really glad I did!
Echo is wonderful. It understands spoken language very well. I love how it's compatible with IFTTT. It can do just about anything.
I love this tablet. Easy to use and has a lot of features.
I was looking for a good speaker for my wife that was easy. This is a good speaker and could not be easier once set-up. Set up is the only reason for not giving it a 5. Initial set-up is easy, but getting skills and some music with separate log ins was a little confusing.
we gave this as a gift to an older person to basically use as an e-reader. so far it has worked great.
The 7" amazon fire tablet has came along way since the kindle version. This is a full android tablet loaded with many great features. Price range makes it excellent for kids too.
Very fun and useful product that can only get better with time. Kind of similar to Siri or Google Assistant on Steroids but has the potential to be so much better!
I love my fire stick movies , music, even movies that just came out are all free wow this is the best Valentines Gift ever and for all ages to enjoy so get yours today
Love this tablet. So easy to use. My kids love it.
The Echo was on sale for $99 (marked down from $179) so I decided to buy it. I have the Google My Home but Alexa is better. It has 18000 words in its vocabulary.
My wife's laptop bit the dust and I needed a low-cost solution so she could read her email and surf the net. This device does the job. I was impressed with the quality for $50. I have no complaints. Cheap, easy to use and keeps the wife happy. Good deal!

The Amazon Fire TV saved me from having to buy a new TV. My 2011 Samsung no longer supported HBO Go and other apps. Amazon Fire TV allows me to watch that and literally hundreds more channels and apps. Most are free, some you have to pay for. Easy to install and easy to use!
This thing is used everday. I had this guy Vincent program it with cody.he has been doing this for several years. Cable channels movies just like my direct Tv.
The tap is a great product! Access to Alexa in a grab and go format!
I purshased this as a gift for my husband since he has Amazon Prime already, It was so easy to set up, and works great, he can check his calendar, play his music, ask her questions, get the days news report,& even get a joke for the day. Lots of fun & interesting facts. Love it
This is a great value for the money. It is easy to use and has a lot of great features . In addition to the ability to read books on it, I can listen to music; play games and use it as a camera. It is a great value for the money. The screen is large enough to make reading easy.
I initially bought the paperwhite for myself, but gave it to my husband. I had read about the voyager, and they said it wasn't necessarily worth updating from the paperwhite, but if you were buying your first, go for it. It's a bit thinner and lighter, supposedly has a bit better font (don't know about that).
Bought for my 3 year old so she could be like her older sisters and this little device doesn't disappoint. I wish there were more silicone cases available for it and I absolutely can't stand the ads Amazon puts on these Fire tablets.
Got this for my 18 month old son so that he can watch movies on our trip to LA and he loved it. Lots of games, apps and much more. Still learning more features about this product and we love it too.
I love the kindle fire. This is my second-- I wore the first one out! I got it to read books and love that I can pack all my favorite books to go all in one small tablet! No more box of books to go camping! Also the larger print is easier on my eyes and if I fall asleep ot shuts itself off.
I was disappointed that she can't connect to you tube. She's otherwise great. You have to be very specific when asking her something. When I ask about news in a certain region. She just gives the general news which may have nothing about the specified region.
i love this amazon fire tv box and best buy had the lowest price and they have the best customer service
It is high recomend for everyone, it is fast and afforable player.
This kindle is great, but it requires a cover to protect the screen - it's easily scratched.
It's cheap so I didnt expect it to be amazing, nor am I disappointed, it's great for streaming video. Even better with chromecast.
I purchased this echo as a gift it was exactly what she wanted
Easy to use. Comfortable to hold-lightweight and good size. The light adjustment is great. Easy to inadvertently turn the page-sometimes more than one-still trying to figure out how not to do that. Over all, though very happy with it
I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
I love my Echo. I use it everyday. I recommend it.
Amazon's voice-activated smart home speaker is undeniably futuristic, but it's also practical and accessible. With a rapidly growing slate of features, integrations and use cases, it's easy to get excited about the Echo's potential.
Works well for children. It is user friendly and easy to use.
Imagine my 4 grandkids joy when they opened their gifts. Love love love them!
I am very happy with the kindle fire hd 8. it is very easy to use.
Was hesitate about buying the echo because of price. When it went on sale I said I had to have it. After realizing what it is and how to use it even if it wasn't on sale I would have ordered anyway.
Works well, gives a to of additional options for home television entertainment for everyone.
This works great and provides me tons of options with apps.
Great purchase. Great customer service. Definitely
Since we amazon prime it give us a lot of entertainment for my grandson music and videos , good and small investment.
Bought it for 2nd twin's BD (age 14), after he requested one. He has broken a screen to a different PAD; it slipped out of the car on to the ground, when he opened the door. He said, "I wouldn't do it--but I am sure that it wouldn't break, if I threw it down on the ground" just as the packaging said!
Wish you could choose the response name of your own instead of the ones provided
This item is great for kids reading! set up a Kindle account and they pick the books! Many free!
Love it. Play any music, get weather, news, sports info and so much more. Create shopping lists and reminders. It's also an alarm clock and can make your home a smart home with some accessories.
I have used this for a while now and what can I say .. just love it and worth buying ..
I needed something bigger than my phone screen to browse with and came across this tablet. The screen quality is good
I enjoy being able to ask Alexa to play music, tell me the weather or give me the latest headlines on the news all while I'm walking around my house. Totally love it
I absolutely love Alexa! It was so easy to set up and its incredibly easy to use!!
good value for the money ..............................................................................................................
This is an excellent device and easy to use. 5 stars if you have Amazon Prime and want to use what's included with Prime. But if you don't have Prime, any Android TV Box would be better at half the cost.
I never have any issues with this company or products!
I used Google Chromecast before but by far, this is the best, even better than Apple tv. I have also Amazon echo so this even makes it better for me.
This is simply the best and most TV for the money. I should have cut the cable years ago!
We bought the Echo because we listened to the music at a friends house,- We came home and ordered it that day. We think this is the best little invention so far. We love listening to our music anywhere there is an outlet and wifi. Go buy one. You won't regret it.
Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price.
It is only a USB 5 Watt charger. Had now issues with the actual unit as it produced 4.6 watts on a check load but comparing it to what is available to do the same thing there are cheaper options. So minus one star for over priced and that it doesn't come with a cable
I bought this tablet as Bestbuy was closing them out. I find the screen is okay but not iPad quality. The speed is fine for my intended use but I would not be happy if I needed to use as my primary tablet.The operating system is lower then the current android build and I have not found a upgrade path.
I got this as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old son and he absolutely loves it. It is very user friendly and I love the parental controls.
Purchased this Fire TV box mainly to watch PlayStation Vue and it works perfectly with the service. Amazon Prime works great too as expected. No buffering or lag while streaming. Highly recommended.
I got this for a Christmas present for my son, but couldn't help myself. It's awesome. Looks like momma is rewrapping for him, or buying another :D
Alexa is great to use; her recognition is good, and if you have Spotify and Pandora accounts you can really get a lot out of it (and light / outlet kits: saying "Alexa, turn on the living room" feels exquisitely dorky). Plus, it's the only way to order the Dot, which is essentially the top of this speaker. After a week with the Echo, I purchased 2 Dots for other rooms. Again, to get the most out of this, you need to own Kindle Books, have a Spotify account, and preferably Audible / Unlimited.
Enjoy my Kindle Fire for the price. Easy to use and nice clear wording.
We are pleased with our Echo! Alexa is very useful. We utilize her to change the temp via our Nest, setting multiple timers is extremely helpful when cooking, and we play music via Spotify and check the following day's weather almost every evening!
Really like the Kindle Paperwhite. Easy to handle, easy to read, easy to access my books. Recommend.
Holds a lot of books and is readable in any light situation
You can't beat the Fire tablets for the price. Can't tell much of difference with non Hd screen. Highly recommend
Bought this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVES it!!! The protective case it is in is AWESOME and the perfect pink for a girl!
works great for the price.but it shoves amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv.and is linked to your amazon 1 click buy if you haveit set up that way.
This was purchased for a secret santa gift, but seems like a great value for the money.
I love Alexa. I can control my thermostat and all my light switches with her. This product is definitely worth the money.
I used to have a paperwhite-style Nook, but when it needed replacing, they no longer offered the device. Unfortunately, the newer Nook's screen would turn black and practically unreadable in the sunlight. So I got the Kindle. SOO happy! The screen is wonderfully readable, even in bright sunlight, and is capable of being back-lit for night-time reading as well. Best of both worlds ~ Especially since I seem to take reading material with me everywhere I go!
Purchased to use in conjunction with PlayStation VUE. Fire TV offers the guide menu and is recommended by many. So far very Pleased!
After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds "old fashioned", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking.
This is the one to get after Amazon's update to have the device always on. It also has the best speaker of the three.
It's going to take more work to get her up to useful capacity, but she has a nice speaker for music in the kitchen.
I purchased the amazon echo as a mother's day gift for my wife and it has quickly become a gift for the entire family. The sound quality from the speaker is above average and we can play music either from iHeart Radio or from any of our connected bluetooth devices. It quickly connects to the wifi in my house and is very portable. We haven't used alexa for many of the home automated functions (lights, electronic, ordering food online, etc) but once we purchase wifi outlets, we will most likely try the technology out. Overall, we are very happy with the product.
I love this tablet. I store all my kindle books on it. I also set it up for my 4 year old grandson to play on it.
Amazing product from Amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it
My son and I bought my wife the Kindle Paperwhite for Christmas and she loves it! This charger is great for trips where we need a charge in the vehicle or while visiting relatives!
love kindles and this one is the best one made by amazon. but expensive.
I absolutely love my Kindle fire! I'm able to do everything on it; read, watch videos, play games, listen to music, shop, etc.
You can use Wi-Fi anywhere that it's available. Lots of choices
I love it ! Tons of options and endless entertainment
This is my first kindle purchase, and I couldn't be happier with it. Before I bought it I was very concerned that it would be too small for me to enjoy reading on, but my concern was soon expunged. I have always read books, then as I grew older and my eye sight grew worse, I moved to reading on my iPad Air because I could increase the size of the print. The downside to my iPad though, was that it would get heavy to hold as I read, and after a while I would get some eye strain from the light being projected out from the device, even in night mode to a point, even though that was much better. So I decided to try the Kindle Paperwhite with the new 300 ppi type. I couldn't be happier with it. It's light to hold, even in one hand, which I do a lot, I can still adjust the type size to what I want, the type is very crisp and easy to read, and I find that I don't get the eye strain that I used to. One other benefit to the Kindle is that reading outside is even better than reading inside, which can not be said for the iPad.Another benefit to the Kindle is that if I still feel like reading the book for a while on my iPad, using the free Kindle app, my iPad syncs perfectly with my Kindle, so that it will start on the same page that I stopped on with my Kindle, so that I can seamlessly move from one device to the other.The only slight disappointment that I had with it, was that the battery doesn't last as long as they lead you to believe. I found myself having to recharge it about two thirds the way through the book, but realistically that's no big deal to me.If you are debating on whether or not the Kindle Paperwhite would be right for you to read on, my recommendation is to buy it. I don't think that you will be disappointed.
Good tablet for kids to enjoy and play with not if you are trying to do something big on it
Great assistant but does not know it all. Certain things you ask gets no response.
Still learning the things Alexa can do, but so far, I'm extremely happy with my purchase.
My first tablet and I really enjoy it. Portable and efficient
I had one, it was a gift. When it broke down I wanted another one. So I bought this one.
Didn't do all that I wanted it to but it is sufficient for my 8 year old son.
This is the best tablet ever! Great price and quality! I definitely recommend everyone to get this tablet if you travel a lot or just for use casually around the house. At 49.99 price point, you can't beat that!
Set up is easy and works well from the start. Will purchase another for the extra room
It works well fast and easy to get to my email and Facebook too.
I bought this after speaking with a sales rep in Tigertown. I bought this for my kid and he loves it. Its my 2nd kindle.
Way better than the amazon stick. I use it for kodi
works as i expected... pretty fast and pretty good display as well. i can't complain at all at this price. yes, if you take a look at it side by side with galaxy ($200), this is not as good. But, as long as you use for surfing and quick things like music and games, works great.
Simply the Fastest and Best tablet for the money and Best Buy was the easiest place to get it.
We like this tablet and the fact it is easy on the eyes for reading.
Alexa doesn't always know what you're talking about, but we love hearing her good morning quotes and anecdotes and the audio quality for listening to music is very nice - similar to a bose sound.
Its a great alternate for expensive canle tv services!
Like the fact I can watch netflix on it. Daughters loved theirs!
Gift for my great nephew and he really loves it. He loves it so much that Mom has to limit amount of time he allowed to play with it because he would play it 24/7.
Goal: get an e- reader that allows one to read in any light situation. Goal achieved. Reading on the patio, beach is great. Easy to download books, lightweight, good battery life are all pluses
This is an Awesome product. Would highly recommend.
Great little traveling entertainer. Good for reading and playing most games. You'll be disappointed by the limited content and the internet functionality is very limited. Other than that, for watching short clips, or any Amazon content, it's great. Very pricey. I do not recommend this for kids.
I have always been an avid paper book reader. Never thought I could convert! Purchased the Kindle at Best Buy and I am totally hooked! Love the convenience as well as simp,e access to books (inexpensive) on line.
this was just what I needed for surfing the web and watching hbo to go as well as amazon prime and all the books you can get. good product!!!
This Amazon tap is not only a great Bluetooth speaker, which is half of the reason I bought it for. But it also has some awesome voice control. I bought a wemo switch, plugged it into an old lamp, setup some commands with ittt, and in 5 minutes I was using my Amazon tap to control a lamp. Pretty cool. I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap. But alas the Amazon tap is a Bluetooth speaker so I can always use my phone as a streaming device, or hook my phone up through the aux port as well. But all in all this is a great speaker, that can do everything any Bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra.
Had it for about year and would say it had good voice recognition and sound quality. Seemed to be functional and worked really well.
This fire Tv is a great product and it met my expectations.
This was a gift for my sister and she love it she going purchase one for her daughter
After not being extremely keen on choosing "Alexa" for my husband's birthday gift I am now a total fan! While he loves the customized music play lists, I use her for just about everything else! Her shopping and to do lists have saved me countless trips (and gas) for what I would normally forget to do while I'm out the first time! (Great for Earth Day conservation)!
I saw this on sale and used points so it cost me $49 haha suckered who pay 160 anyway it works awesome and sets up in a few mins on sale for $100
Gift for mom. didn't know if she would use it. Seems to be useful and makes it easy for her to listen to music. Also helps with weather, jokes tend to be corny. Hasn't used it to order anything. Got one for other family members and they seem to use it too.
Nice tablet. Screen is clear even though not high level HD. Amazon features with android capabilities work well!
I read a lot, this tablet makes it convenient for me to carry many books without all the weight. The screen lighting is adjustable for different light situations.
I was hoping for a 'google' experience, but it isn't there yet. There is a lot of questions that it can't answer. I hope, and expect it to get better. The music player is a nice feature that I use frequently.
Amazon fire tv pretty nice highly recommend. 5 star item.
After dropping my Kindle with a keyboard (not techie enough to know which generation it was) I did plenty of research before getting my next Kindle.I wanted a dedicated ebook as I don't want distractions when I read. Let's make this simple:I have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.The automatic light makes it great for night reading.It took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last Kindle, this was a feature I really wanted. I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either. I do like this more than my last Kindle, so that is all that really matters.
Not what I expected .. This thing pretty much runs according to skills & not just ask a question & it searches the Internet. I find Siri much better because it does search the net. I can ask the same question the same way & you always get an answer with Siri but not with Alexia. It always say I do not understand the question. Again this thing needs much improvement & it's not worth the price tag especially when Siri is included with my iPhone.
Really like the echo. This is my second one. I put this one in the kitchen. I got this one because of the size and needed one to be centrally located in my house.
The kids will have a lot of fun time with games and learning
This is just perfect for my tween boy. It is easy for him to use and play games on while we are driving in the car.
Awesome Price for a great tablet.Main use is for reading comics and internet browsing so there is nothing better i would ask for.good screen,easy set up
This has increased my movie watching. It works so well I purchased a second one.
I bought this kindle fire because it was on sale. After I took it home i realized I would have bought it at full price. This is a great ereader that you can also use to browse the web. My son loves using this to read his Ebooks and play his games.
I saw this come up on the deal of the day and didn't know it's capabilities.Connected in less than 1 minute to my wireless network and it was up and running. The microphones pick up my voice from across the room and I can even connect the blue tooth speaker to my apple products iPhone and iPad! Has huge music playback from all the services, Pandorra , iHeart, Amazon Prime and others. I haven't even used 10% of its capabilities. I also control my remote Ecobee3 thermostats. Waiting for the next deal of the day so I can get a few more of these for upcoming Holiday and Birthday gifts!
What a terrific device. You can ask it anything and she has an answer. It's small enough to place anywhere so it doesn't look instructive
After being really hesitant on switching from hard copy books to a kindle I decided to go for it. Ever since I've used it I have loved it simplicity and how adapting it can be to light. Still love paper copied books, but kindle versions are much simpler.
Purchased for my granddaughters. They both loved it. I also purchased light starter kit so they can turn their light on in their bedroom using Alexa.
Good one to configure everything ina. Easy way. Thanks
I purchase my Alexia about a month ago and waited to write this review in order to get more familiar with its operation. Set up was a breeze with no problems connecting to my home network. At present I am using my Alexia for my morning news briefs while having breakfast. Listening to Bloomberg, CNN, Fox, and Reuters news briefs you pretty much get an insight of whats happening in the world. If you wake her up by saying Alexia, good morning she will give you some interesting information concerning the day. I also use her for reviewing by daily schedule and local weather before heading out. No longer do I have to search in my iPad. Listing to music is a pleasure since the sound is very acceptable and I can change the volume or skip song without even moving. She response to my voice from across the room. The timer function is a help when cooking, and setting a alarm by voice is a great convenience, eliminating some use of my phone. It would be nice to have Alexia call your contacts on your phone with IFTTT but that would involve uploading your contact list to Amazon, something that at the moment I would not do. My future plan is to interface Alexia with a smart home system which will operate by voice control. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend Alexia to anyone.
We've had a great time with Alexa. For entertainment, and for smart home uses. She remains an infant and I'm hopeful for expanded technology. It's going to be a must have in the future.
This is a great tablet, just the right size. I wish the cord was longer, but it was still really good. It stays charged for the right amount of time.
great
Got this to use with my SmartThings home automation system. Use voice commands from the Echo to trigger automation. Much more convenient than getting your phone out and loading the SmartThings app. Sometimes it has a hard time understanding what I say.
great tablet for the price ! my 9 year old daughter loved it !!
im loving this Amazon kindle reader, its the easy one to use.
I bought this for my son after he broke his iPad, and I am so glad I did!! It has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read!! Love love this tablet!!!
Wonderful selection of movies, TV series, etc. Variety of programming has something for everybody
Great product, small and barely noticeable on top of my DVD player.
I also bought my one for my 15yr. old and my 14yr. old child. My 4yr. old loves it and he can play it with no problem. I think it far most the best tablet you can get for under $50. I would recommend it.
Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can't believe it so inexpensive!
easy to use light weight, I love the games it has.
I got my Amazon FireTV from Best Buy. At that time they were fully stocked as hoped for. The price was great. Best Buy is my store.
Bought 2 of these for Christmas for my sons. One of them seems to be a bit better than the other. One works as I would hope it would, the other acts a little hard if hearing (I'm speaking about the Echo, not my sons)! Alexa doesn't always recognize her name and obey commands.
Bought the tablet on Black Friday to replace a 4 year old Nexus 7. Liked it so much that I purchased another a week later at full price. Bright clear screen, good battery life, expandable memory, fast and easy to use. No complaints.
This product is so fun! We got it for my Dad for his birthday and he hooked it up right away and everyone had fun trying to stump Alexa! Also, we played every type of music, and she got information on a restaurant for us and you can control volume and everything by voice command. It is the first "robot" we have in our home!! Highly recommend this product. I am buying another one today!
I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.
For what this is, it's great. My 13 year old loves it. You'll definitely need to get an sd card for additional storage; but for the price, it's so worth it! Would be much happier with her breaking this than an expensive tablet!
My daughter loves her tablet....she takes it with her everywhere!
This product is very cheap compared to a iPad & works as good!
Purchased for my mother so she would have something bigger to look at besides her phone. It works wonderful.
this was given as a gift and recipient happy with it.
I purchased these tablets for my grandchildren after purchasing 1 for another grandchild in October. They love them and their parents love being able to dictate how they use them.
A bit pricey, but worth the money in my opinion. Perfect size and great screen!
More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books.
excellent quality, easy to use. perfect screen size and picture quality. Not slow at all. very efficient.
Its a good product but the OS is kind of slow.Also when connected to the internet it will sometimes disconnect itself.
Good value tablet, make a good remote for fireTV. Often cheaper at other vendors though.
I purchased this box as a replacement for my Roku 2 box and it is awesome. Can do all the things that Roku cannot do. Best decision ever made in terms of my electronics.
Bought this for my daughter before taking a long drive for vacation. Kept charge long enough on a 6 hour drive to keep her entertained! It was very easy to setup and use!
One of my major issues with e-book ls is using screens and the annoying glare. While the paper white still isn't a printed page it does a good job of getting close. With the backlight optional it retains the benefit of being able to read at night too. I love my iPad but prefer the Kindle Paperwhite for all my e-books.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and I'm glad she shares. It's a pleasure to read books and it's great that either of us can read in a dark bedroom without disturbing the other.
I have found my echo to be fun and useful! It understands what i say most of the time.
everything from hest buy is working perfect i like that
It's amazing and I will like to tell a friend and family
Amazing what these little things can do, I Willy continue to buy them again and again.
My son washed it twice! Throw it a few times and it's still ticking.
I was hesitant at first to buy it. But now I use it daily. Definitely recommended if you have an Amazon prime account. You can watch movies and listen to music on here. I bought the fire tv instead of the stick for future use of 4k content. It also has a micro sd slot, usb port, and digital audio port. With the support of apps you can stream content from your home networked PCs also.
I absolutely love my Amazon Echo. I purchased the Echo Dot for a second room!! I love to play "old school" music and it has found some really fantastic music. Very helpful in answering most questions. I have so much more I am planning to do once I learn more!
Cheap tablet for price, for a kid or an older person that might not know how to use it.
It wasn't what I thought it was the price was too much for what I got Very disappointed
The Kindle is easy to use, has a bright back light and travels conveniently in a coat pocket.
Great overall. Easy to use and navigate on. Charge the battery fully and it doesn't last long. Only used for nightly reading mostly and the battery needs to be charged daily. Not thrilled about that
Enjoying being able to see the words on the kindle everywhere. Being able to dim is also a wonderfuI feature
I got this for my 7 yo and she loves it. Used the kindle for her reading
I love it from the first moment, would love to be more intercative.
We liked the newest model over the other models. The price was good during the holidays.
Friendly user for kids enjoyed being able to read books.
Bought it for my 94 year old Mother who is losing her vision. It has opened up a whole new world for her!
Bought the kindle for my daughter and it's has been wonderful to help define words as she is going. It is also nicely compact for easy travel from place to place.
Top notch streaming box, especially if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber. I like the voice search but wish it extended to other applications like Netflix.
it is awesome for the price can't ask for more, and it's on sale when i got it.
It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it
I heard nothing but good things about the fire tv. Although I had to ask around to see if someone could hook it up because it didn't come with instructions but overall I'm extremely happy.
This is by far something great to stream and the programs you can download to it are great. Worth the money if you know what you know what you are using it for.
Great for my 5 year old, but battery only lasts 7 hours if it's not being used!
I bought this for my son, and I'm going to buy myself one because I keep using his.
Easy to use and read with good battery life. Highly recommend.
Bought this tablet for my 84 year old grandpa and he loves it. Easy to use
This is a good tablet. I only gave it 4 stars because it is only 8 go. Otherwise is working well.
so beautiful and system is very good and the app is good too.
Does all they claim. Am really enjoying my new Kindle.
Very good reading gadget.. delivers all I need. Size and shape good for take anywhere.
The speaker is very good. I've had no problems with it understanding my commands. I enjoy having Alexa around the house!
Did not realize how small it would be but it seems to do the job...Still learning how to use but have a free Geek Squad appointment this week to review and setup. Love that about BB.
great tablet for the price. excellent gift for anyone
Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
Voice recognition works great. Wish Amazon had more sophisticated features available through this device. However, there's lots of innovation going on here. You won't be disappointed. The speaker is pretty good for something this size.
This product is much better than the fire stick I wish it came with a HDMI cable though
I purchased the paperwhite so that I could read in the middle of the night without disturbing my husband. It works like a charm, and helps me to fall back asleep faster. The different light settings are fantastic. I really love the dictionary look up feature too.
The Fire TV works great and is very fast. Some apps are in the cloud but others have to be purchased through Amazon. Only problem was getting battery cover off of remote
we bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them these are the best tablets on the market they have great learning apps on them aswell
Easy set up and usage! Great fun for all in the house! Got one for myself and one as a gift. Great for any age. Highly recommend
it works perfectly...4k for 4k tivi and amazon prime
I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and she loves it. She uses it everyday. The paper white version is fantastic. There is no glare, it doesn't get too bright if the room is dark, and she uses it outside as well as in the car all the time with no screen issues! This device has been charged once and that was when we first got it. She hasn't had to charge it in over a month. Highly recommend!!!
This product is really useful, got to use it at a hotel.
My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in "brick". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix.
The echo is all that we expected; use as speaker/music in the kitchen.
I had an older Kindle and enjoyed it for many years. After I accidentally left it out in the rain, I was worried that I would not enjoy the newer versions as much as I had the old version. I was wrong. I absolutely love it! I enjoy reading outdoors and it's great to be able to read into the night - the fact that it is backlit is great!
Good Average device for internet content but for 4K forget about it, but if your looking for a simple HD content is good enough.
If you have prime it's great for the money. Slow performance tho
I tried to get this since Christmas and it's finally available. Can't wait to use it.
This thing is awesome!! Brings a lot of fun to the family!
I bought this tablet to use while I'm on the go. I am retired and have used a desktop my whole life. I have tried the Apple IPAD but did not want to spend the money as I have a desktop @ home. So this works just fine for limited use. I use Google, surfing the internet when waiting for something away from home, etc. Keep myself entertained!
this is my first foray into purchasing a reader...I reviewed multiple sites and opinions before I made a move on this purchase...and not disappointed, can read anywhere in any light
Works great for my 5 year old, bought a child case and is just the right size for him to play games and watch movies.
EXCELLENT PRODUCT IT SAVES YOU MONEY ON WATCHING YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOWS AND SPORTS AND MOVIES .
This is great for watching Amazon original shows and free tv
I have a smart tv, but Netflix and all the other apps take too long to load.With the Fire tv they load faster and when watching series movies the chapters load automaticly as with with my smart tv I have to select every single tittle. It felt kind of a headache some times, but with the Fire tv n more and the picture look great!
I love dis tablet just wish the screen wasn't crack!
I bought this product as a gift for a couple of boys. They really enjoy it. It also works great with Amazon Prime.
Picture quality is very clear good size to take with me.I wished i would found a cover for this model at the store. Universal model does not work as to I have to take cover off to use camera
I bought this for my son to have access to Netflix and a few games. Although I think the parental controls are too complicated, I really like the tablet.
Installed easily however little documentation for total setup and individual preferences. Loads of features and uses would be nice if documentation was included with purchase. However how to books can be found in the internet.
Great improvement over the old kindle fire. Better size than the hd7. Not to big and not too small. Fast processing spead.
I bought this to replace my old roku 2 and i am completely satisfied with the purchase.
Very good product. I recommend to anyone to buy it.
Love my echo and going to purchase a second one for an RV.
Works great for my 4 year old son. As for me I'm not that big of a fan because of the apps not that same as android or apply
Easy to use...lightweight. Easy to read. prefer this font to that of ipad or computer
Short on memory but easily expands with memory stick. Works great for everyday tasks.
Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.
Got it for my 2 year old nephew. He is now completing puzzles and playing educational games on it!
Easy to set. Easy to use. So glad I upgraded my Fire Stick to the Fire Tv box.
I always buy iPads because I am an Apple fanboy, but these tablets (I bought several) have been great for the price and for what I want them for and that is to entertain kids at my business. These are much more affordable than iPads if your just playing games on them.
Bought as a gift for my mother in law for her birthday
Good value, enjoy using it! I recommend this highly!
As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller "just" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!
A great alternative to cable/satellite. Not as expensive as Apple TV but just as much content. Got it on sale at a great price.
I bought this tablet for my husband and son and both have not had any issues with it. Easy to use. Great over all.
This item is a must have for everyone. Very easy to use.
Love it. It does all I need and then some. Great price and great features.
Onsale is 39.99 is cheap , good for new stars tablet
I was in best buy having computer worked on, waiting I saw the Amazon fire 6, and saw the great price and bought it. I have been pleased with the features and user friendly.
Great item works perfect and great protection. Exactly what I needed.
My son and I wanted to find a small tablet to watch videos on and do some basic internet browsing. This tablet fit the bill perfectly. We weren't looking for all the bells and whistles and wanted to find something in our budget. At $49 this little piece of Fire is amazing. The graphics are great, not HD but still great. The speed is acceptable and otherwise it's easy to use. I love the dimensions, it's easy to carry and not heavy. Absolutely Love it!
Bought this as a gift--recipient was happy to receive it. After browsing prices online, I chose to purchase with Best Buy instead of Amazon because it was a better deal. The free two-day shipping was a nice bonus as well. A good experience all around; would definitely recommend.
Tablet is working good. I brought it for my daughter as a christmas gift. It features a freetime app for kids only that way they cant download and surf the browser. My only complaint is that when u turn the tab off and log into the kid profile it has to download all the apps again.
Excelent for reading, and for the kids. Own two of these, and they both work perfectly.
I'm very happy with this purchase.It plays a good selection of music, sets alarms, etc.
This is a very good tablet to have for reading or playing games.
I JUST luv my Fire HD Tablet,love playing my games on it,so easy to carry around
This is a great kindle for the youngers at a great price!
The screen is beautiful. It does everything the iPad can do if not more. You are definitely not settling for less but, keeping more money in your pocket if you choose this device over and iPad.
When compared to Google home, echo is good for connecting smart devices. If you are on amazon ecosystem then this is a great product. I like google home over echo due to the natural english speaking ability and conversation that i can have and get responses back.
This product was just as expected. Will order more.
very user friendly. my daughter has no problem navigating around to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime
I love this box with its bigger memory capabilities. Looks great on my 4k tv
It is okay so to speak. It does what it says it will. I feel it has much more potential however and look forward to updates.
My family loves the firetv. The only thing we had to do was upgrade our Internet speed.
We love this thing! And for only $50! It works perfect for quick netflix
Had trouble setting it up. Set it up using app on wife's phone. It doesn't work when wife's phone is out of the house. Grandkids have fun with it. Music speakers are good. I have a lot to learn about this thing.
This device really allows you to use it for multiple reasons. It's a tablet and kindle all in one. I love this device.
affordable for the kids and quality is good not like other cheap tablet, amazon always make a good product.
Set up was easy and load times and picture quality is amazing. The only set back is you have to purchase pretty much anything. I understand buying a movies , but to have to buy tv episodes is a draw back. I could just stick with my direct tv for that
I gave this for Christmas to my 12 year old child. He been using it all the time to resd. He has download books from the library. He will try using it for schhool. We use to go the the library every week and he would come home with 8-10 books.and these would pile up around the house. Now all in the Kindle! Good clear screen. Glad i upgraded to the better one. Easy to set up as he open the box and did it all himself.
still learning, previously used a nexus7. Like the larger screen. Reading kindle books on it is good too.
I bought this not knowing if I would like it.LUVIT
This is a great Kindle. It has great sound and clarity of the screen. Easy to use.
Love the backlight of the Kindle Paperwhite. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
Yes it is heavy, bulky and the adds are annoying but for the price it is a great little tablet.
Great price and easy to use.Wife loves it more than any other tablet.
This was a great buy. I would recommend to everyone who likes to have tv options!
I like the sound and the wireless capability. Looks good, too.
Echo is great fun particularly if you have connected devices like Wemo or Lifx bulbs or Next thermostat. At first you think you may not use that much, then you find yourself telling it to turn on the lamp or turn down the thermostat, like when you are cooking and your hands are messy. I have a lot of Wemo switches and Lifx bulbs, and it's fun to group them together and tell Echo to turn on everything and watch it all turn on at once. It's also fun to ask her about actors and actresses on tv while watching, like how old is so and so person. Alexa is not perfect, but she is pretty good at getting things right most times. The bad thing is you'll find yourself wanting to buy more Wemo switches and stuff just to have fun with Echo. Note, Alexa can only control Wemo bulbs by using IFTT, but the switches it has direct integration with. Lifx bulbs have direct integration, but you can't change the colors without IFTT I think, and Nest thermostat has direct integration. Looking to the future for more direct integration of things.
Really surprised at what this little tablet can do. I am starting to use it more than my iPad. Easier to take on vacation (smaller footprint). More comfortable to hold while reading books online.
I only use Amazon products for streaming and I always recommend them to my friends & acquaintances as well.
Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he's using it without getting frustrated, which is huge!
Great product but only as good as what you have to sync to it.
I LOVE my Paperwhite Kindle. The convenience of this product speaks for itself. I can read and purchase books anywhere, anytime.When my husband bought me my first Kindle 9-10 years ago, I opened it up and wasn't too sure I was going to like it. Boy was I wrong! I will never go back to books. Best product ever, well worth the money.
Got this for the kids and the love them. !!!!!!!!!!!
Satisfied so far. Look forward to the updates. I would purchase again.
The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
Kodi fans get the TV! Even if you have the stick, upgrade. You'll be happy you did. Very cool item!!!!
Fast delivery from Best Buy as always. The fire stick is awesome. High Quality video great selection. Good Value.
...browse. Buy a good case as this might slip thru your hands and fall.
easy to use plenty of space for a kid recommend warranty
I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend's 8yr old daughter. She absolutely loves it, and it was easy to set up and use.
This is cool. Helps me keep up with to do list and quick answers.
This is my first e-reader. I like it so far. Easy to use interface. The ads can be kind of annoying, but keeps cost lower.
For my 11 yr old, serves it purpose which is playing games and listening to music
What a great tablet. I purchased this Amazon fire tablet for my niece for Christmas I love the colors that are available, the price was excellent. Very happy with my purchase definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a low price tablet.
I upgraded to this from a Kindle Keyboard, so it was huge upgrade. Holds more books and has a back light. The light is fairly uniform but not so bright that it will bother the person next to you. Battery lasts a good long while and it is easy to read in direct sunlight too.
Love this fire stick and the ability to display a much crisper and clearer picture
Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and now I have a very mini laptop. I also have a first generation kindle and even that one still works perfectly (my daughter uses it)
I love it, very easy to use and so much information so readily available. It's limitless to what it can be used for, from a radio to encyclopedia with no effort and no set up.
I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day. She loves reading but with the little ones in the house books were hard to keep. We are both very pleased with this as I can use it for a few books too. The picture and color on this thing is pretty darn good. I'm pleased with the sound as well. Overall this price is too good to pass up if you want a color screen reading tablet, this is a solid choice.
I gave the Amazon Echo as a gift. My friend is "setup challenged", so I was expecting a call to head over to get it going. Instead, I received a call telling me how much she LOVED it!
I did the preview about this tablet before I buy it. It is a good tablet for the price and it's not too heavy
This tablet is great and easy to use. Very convenient and handy to have around
It's a good tablet for kids the only thing I really don't like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok
It's 2017 and I was wondering to myself if I should jump on board and get a Kindle paper white. Now and days, people can read ebooks from smartphones to tablets. The thing with me is it caused me eye strain after trying to read my kindle books through my iPad. After much researching and reading the reviews on here, the paper white has been the best purchase decision I've made in order to just sit back and read without causing eye strain. This is only for reading ebooks and is very simple to use. Battery life is amazing and only charge once every two weeks. If you are just looking for a plain ereader, then this gem is your best bet.
When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one.
I bought this tablet as a gift for my granddaughter to play games on. It is very easy for her to use and it is just the right size.
I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets.
Super fast response. Cool remote. Great menus and navigation
With this 3rd generation of the Kindle Paperwhite, Amazon really created the best reading experience for a reasonable price. I previously owned a first generation Paperwhite, and the increase in resolution (300ppi, up from 212ppi) is really noticeable. After reading on this for a while, it is slightly disturbing to see jagged edges around text of the older Paperwhite. The white balance of the screen has also improved, with a slightly warmer, book-ish experience instead of the cooler, electronic-display-ish screen of the old on. Additionally, the screen can get crazy low in brightness! Ideal for someone who prefers to read in bed at night with the lights turned off.. if you thought the previous Kindles got dark, this takes it to a whole new level of dimness.
Love it but ended up returning for the HD8. Would recommend it to anyone.
Alexa is a fun product. We use it to set an alarm, play music and find out about traffic. Only downside so far is that it sometimes does not understand us especially if there is other surrounding noise. Also, the other products it can control are very expensive.
Will play your cloud based music or I Heart Radio station with excellent sound. I have also used it to check the weather everyday and my wife uses it for a timer when cooking. I also like it being linked to my calendar and just asking what is on the calendar today and it will tell me.
Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets.
Replaced my original kindle after if got dropped and screen no longer readable. Turned this new kindle on after charging it and all my books were already there. I didn't have to do anything!
I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE
This tablet is very reasonably priced for children and I love the insurance replacements. Must have for the young ones.
Great quality great movies the Amazon Fire Stick in the Amazon box is the best thing I ever had
The kindle paper white works perfectly. The battery life is amazing!
This thing is the best thing I used I can u it to turn on my lights
Perfect upgrade from the original fire stick great quality!
Reasonably priced and great for the grandkids. We purchased cheaper tablets for them last year and none of them lasted! So far these are looking 100% better.
Picked this up in hopes the kids would read more than usual. It worked not only that but the entire family enjoys it.
Good price, functions well, nice screen to read books
It was an online purchase. I have so far enjoyed my experience and my product.
Love it, love it, love it. I was able to also sync my Sirrius Satelite service to it too.
Piece of mind that the little one won't wonder the World Wide Web and be exposed to things no parent wants to have to explain!
This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It's was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs.
Run nice and smooth in long run. Overall great buy.
I originally had a firestick and it worked okay. Upgraded to the box and it is much faster and no lag. Definitely buy a keyboard to go with it.
I bought this Echo because of the price ,its fun! i like the stereo component the most but I also play with Alexa often,,,,still learning how to submit the skills, most of which you need to interact with Alexa.
I bought this as a gift for a less technically inclined person as a gateway into learning tablets and apps. It was a good gift.
I like the ease of speaking to Alexis, she understand voice request even in a noisy room and she is able to distinguish between my voice and TV or radio. She can instantly fill most request for music and info and I love the stages when you set an alarm. I am a bit concern that she is not loyal to just my voice and anyone around her can input to her and override my music or commands
I bought this Tablet because it had high reviews, and was at a great price for a first Tablet.
This was a gift for a mother. The mother loved the gift
This is my second Kindle. I wore out the first one! I truly enjoy the PaperWhite edition as I can read in bed without any other lights on.
I would have gave it a five star rating but it will change pages to easily. You will either go forward or backwards by just toughing the screen.
Your music, Pandora, etc, alarms, weather.. The entire family loves the echo and its various uses. Easy to set up and start using.
My children think these are the greatest. I'm kind of partial to agree. You can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank.
This tablet was a gift for my 10 yr old who loves my larger table. He loves it and it gets the job done for him.
This is a first for an adult. Price is right, easy to use and just the right size.
Love my new kindle fire. The price was very reasonable.
Excellent charging quality with heavy duty cord. Does not work on Kindle with a cover. Great value.
This our second paper white my husband loves the lighting on it
Best recommendation for a tablet that does everything you need it to do. Expandable memory is a great upgrade to the Fire!
I toyed with the idea of getting an Echo. Now that I have one, I love Alexa. She lives in the kitchen: "Alexa, set the timer for 10 minutes." Using IFTTT.com, she integrates with my Nest thermostat, my Rachio watering system, etc. She lets me know when stuff from Amazon is coming. She is there to answer questions. But she can be annoying when Jeopardy is on the TV. Some contestants with the right voice will give their answer -- remember, the answer is a question -- "Who is Queen Elizabeth II?" And, Alexa will tell you all about Queen Elizabeth II. How can you not love her?
Works as advertised. Amazing product! I would highly recommed this product.
I purchased this for my mom in hopes that she would learn to email. We are still working on it but the tablet is good for basic needs and the price was great.
LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU ASK FOR A SONG AND IT PLAYS IT ALMOST INSTANTLY
I use this Amazon Kindle for Web browsing & social media. Convenient for traveling, but camera sucks so use your phone for pictures.
I travel extensively for work and recently had stopped carrying books to cut down on bulk in my carry-ons. A sale pushed me into finally buying a kindle and it has been a great purchase for me. The screen is extremely easy to read, has almost too much granularity in brightness settings, and is visible in all lighting conditions. The ability to add library e-books is also a huge convenience for being able to read new books, in addition to buying direct from Amazon.
Absolutely love the fire Tv. I first purchased the fire stick which does just what it should but the fire Tv is awesome. Faster bigger.
Fun for a minute but soon realized I could have live without it. I use it to control my Phillip hue Lights and harmony remote which is cool but was a pain to setup.
The best value for the money hands down. Works perfectly.
It's a bit smaller than my original. Backlight makes it simple to see ANYWHERE. Wish there was another option other than touch.
Got this for a Christmas present for her and she loves it. Helps that I am a prime member as well cuz she can download more movies and so on.
Bought this for my father as he is in his 60s and never had a tablet before. He loves it and it works for all his needs.
Very satisfied with the small tablet. Larger than my phone so I can see things better when I play games and look up thing on the internet.
Grandbaby won't put it down loves itShe's dropped it too many times & the blue cover has protected her tablet every time.
It was a nice gift to give for the price.the person looked it to add to rest of Amazon products.
No issues. Love this tablet, so glad we bought it.
Bought 3 off them all together go get your now works good when shopping online
Who knew you could ask a smart device (other than our phone) sitting on your table the weather, play whatever music you want, last nights final sport scores etc and you get a pleasant reply promptly. A fun gadget for todays lifestyles.
Good for smaller kids that cannot play or get to play on Xbox games with 7 other Siblings
I purchased this product for my 13yrs old niece for Christmas and she loves the apps available on the tablet.
Bought as a gift as I have had one for years and love it.
No words can explain what im viewing. I can now watch tv +more
Works well with Alexa controlled switches and external systems. Needs work on answering arbitrary questions that need to be looked up online. but over all worth the price of admission.
Love the tablets. Light, Good battery life, and fast performance.
Lightweight easy read easy page turning self adjusting read light great too.
purchased as a gift but I do have the Echo. If the echo works like the Echo it will be great.
Works well, especially when its given for a gift for someone for the holidays.
4th amazon product I own it is a great budget tablet.
The Amazon Echo is a great tool and has a ton of cool features. Amazon is constantly adding features and tips/tricks to use with "Alexa". I like having my Prime Music playlist going. It's very handy when I'm backing and need to ask a question and my hands are dirty to use my phone to google. What I don't like is that it has to be plugged in the entire time. You will need to purchase a remote to use it in another room. Hopefully they'll fix this with a newer model.
Great price.... It's good for games play and great tablet with this price
exactly what I was looking for. My old tablet stopped working so the value of the Amazon Fire at Best Buy was too much to pass up
Good fit / feel in your hand when using this device.
I have a 17" laptop, cell phone,Chromebook and 4th grader. Adding the 7 (and 8") Fire to the list give us the flexibility with different devices to fit our needs. My laptop is hardly "lap" friendly for more than 15 minutes, much as I do love it. The Fire is very user friendly and parental settings are, 'set it and forget'. The battery life is another huge perk, out lasting most other devices on my list. Picture quality will suffice although I do prefer the 8" Fire tablet.
Bought this for a raffle gift, and everyone wanted to win it. I personally have one too, and love it.
Bought this for a friend she loved it! She always wanted a kindle for reading coz she is an "electronic worm". I am glad she loved it
This tablet works great for my 7 year old son. He loves it. The app store has plenty of apps. I would recommend.
This is my second Amazon echo, I now have one in the bedroom and living area. I work from home so this as become my personal assistant. It's amazing what you can do out of the box but if you like to tinker you can write your own skills and extend the feature set. One of those devices that you wonder how you lived with out it.
I'm writing this review after one month's use of the Amazon Fire 7 tablet (2015 model, aka "fifth generation").Pros:-- Good (though not great) image quality;-- long lasting battery;-- Amazon very good at updating device.Cons:-- not HD (though Amazon makes no claim of it);-- very slow battery recharging;-- claimed quad-core processor is rather slow.Particularly for beginners, this a fine device for simple web browsing; common app use; etc. Camera and photo management are adequate. App store is Amazon's (not Google Play); and processor is much too slow for any kind of advanced gaming. Updates are helpful; device did not come with Alexa ability, but Amazon has since installed an Alexa app. For $39, it's a reasonable value.
This is the way to go, has everything you need and more.
So far the echo has been great...but there is a limited amount of skill and a lot of them are very useless. Once I add the accessories tonmake my home "smarter" I can get more use out of it. The speakers are incredible. Hope to have one or a dot in more rooms.
If is better for the price , I bought fur the kids.
Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack
Christmas present for husband,we both love the echo can't wait to download apps
Great sharp pictures and easy navigation. Enjoy the different background option for my books.
He loves to read his books through this kindle. Not to complicated and easy to use.
My 8 year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet, I needed to get her a replacement. This tablet fit the bill exactly, a great screen, relatively fast CPU, and best of all, it's cheap!I was able to find instructions online for installing Google PlayStore, in which I then gave her the tablet. She loves it!
It was the easiest tablet to use. I bought about 5 of them and it was good for traveling.
A gift for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it.
Bought for my son. Works great. Great tablet for the $.
Love this Amazon Fire TV. I hooked it up to my bedroom TV and started watching all of my favorite shows on Netflix, and other apps that comes on this! Great!
Lots of fun. Music, information, weather, Alexa is like a new family member.
This is just what this avid reader needed!! Now I can read everywhere.. even in bright sun light!
Bought for $40 for my toddler. Mostly used for Netflix and a few kid games.
For the price this is a great tablet kid friendly as easy to use
This is an awesome tablet, not to mention and excellent price!!!
Bought as birthday present for grandson and he plays with it daily and with the case on it he hasn't broken it either.
Purchased as a gift. Very well pleased. Best Buy is great for all electronics purchases.
My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.
It is an ok product. But the main reason for the purchase was because it was for a first time tablet owner. It is very cheap in price but without a google play store it kind of sucks. But like it says it is ok for the price.
The 2nd generation fire tv is great for Amazon services. This is my second fire tv and I purchased it to stream Playstation Vue. I love the Vue service and the fire tv is much faster than the fire tv stick
Enjoy all the features of the tablets from gaming to pictures. Battery life is good as well
Alexa on the go. Works as Bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone.
Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small
While I will usually charge my kindle via my computer's USB ports, I will be able to recharge the device on occasions when I am away from my computer.
I was worried about what I'd be compromising with a 49 dollar tablet, but this kindle is extraordinary for the specs. Yes it has a mono speaker and it's not HD but it's a fast performing tablet and you can't really tell. I don't regret this purchase at all!
Got in a little trouble with the missus and picked this up as a smoothing over gift. she loves it
blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you
This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there.
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere
I got this for my niece. I would say this product is sturdy enough for kids 6 and older. She is able to play games and watch videos on it. She does occasionally read with it too. Overall a great product and won't break your bank.
I read a lot on the iPhone and iPad which also have Kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day; this little Kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. The recent sale price made it practical to get one, and I'm glad I did.
I bought this tablet for my daughters birthday, and she loves it. Reliable, and easy to use. May buy Another one for my wife.
Alexa is OK for basic weather and turning on/off a light you have linked on your network. She still has some issues understanding basic commands and i would love to see skills from major airlines that allow you to check flights before you drive to the airport. The music sound quality is good and you have to be an Amazon Prime member to really see value there. Hopefully, in a year it will turn out to be a good investment.
My gift to my grandchildren they are on it 24/7 would recommend this, prices have gone down since I first bought my oldest granddaughter hers
Own a few dots, needed this for office area. The speaker is amazing and you can feel the quality. Alexa is here to stay.
I purchased this to replace the Ereader I had. It has done that and so much more.
I bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from Bose and Beats. I purchased this one because it had great sound, but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via Alexa voice control. I love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice. It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear. If not in my library, it will play from Prime Music, similar to the way Apple Music functions. Additional voice features I use are news reports, weather forecasts, and control of WeMo switches in my home. Overall a great buy.
I love this! Easy to set up and easy to use. Would recommend it for sure.
The Echo was very easy to set up and use. My wife has this set up in our living room and the sound is incredible. We use it for party's and plan to use for Christmas
this is my fifth kindle i have bought. I love them.
Perfect for me. With Prime membership purchase this becomes indispensable. Always have video, games, and instant backup for documents to cloud, cheap enough to be almost disposable, no worries!
Great value for an awesome gadget. Love it so much
It 's the perfect gift for a senior who has never owned a computer but understands the cellphone.
The echo is perfect, really enjoying all the things that Alexa can do, excited to finally have this!!
I'm love my fire tv great app to download for movie and tv
I purchased this Echo as a gift for my husband and he loves it! He likes having his random questions answered immediately and we're now looking into purchasing other items that work with Alexa.
Great tablet for my kids. Not as many features as an ipad, but also 1/4 of the price...
This tablet was for my daughters birthday and so far , it's holding up well. She loves it and it does what it was meant ro do. The only drawback is the the screen doesn't get bright like your iphone or Samsung tablets.
It was on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went completely dark. Would not turn on after that. The battery was fine....It just quit working all together.
I APPRECIATE the ease of purchasing and reading ! I have found every book title I want plus the recommended books have led me to find new Authors!
This tablet is great for the price & an easy way to read books, too!
our granddaughter loves to read and my wife has one also so we thought this would be a perfect gift for her.
I wasn't sure if I would like having one but LOVE IT!
Bought this for my wife as second amazon tablet that ask for and got what she wanted. Now she's enjoying it!
The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb - Pink is a great tablet
I am happy to have udated my fire! I love having the camera work the way it should. WAy to use.
I have to admit that I am very pleased with my Echo. It was easy to connect to my Amazon Prime account so we have been enjoying music around the kitchen. It is amazingly easy to use. The speaker is great and we are finding it much more than the gimmick I thought it would be. We have enjoyed it so much that we added two Dots, one for each floor.
Bought this as a gift for my daughter and it was a good buyShock proof and great educational apps for kids in it
Just now got it activated. Looks good for now.......
Nice little tablet, no frills involved. Small, lightweight with a decent battery life. Easy to root and replace the software with Android
This is the second one I purchased This one is for our second home. We enjoyed the first one we purchased for a primary home
Great tablet, great price. Perfect gift for your child. My daughter loves it.
Love it because it is thin and light weight and bigger
Now I can get Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime, and a lot more. There is more there than I can watch! Great value! Very easy to setup and flawless operation. I do have a very fast internet so I have no problems whatsoever.
It was an amazing deal for my little cousin. This is a great tablet!!
We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
Is table is good no to fast but work good. Nice picture.
My son is 22 months and he love it. He watches his favorite shows.
Bought for my Grandparents for Christmas and loaded games for them they love it.
I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.
I was hesitant and unsure of the value of the Echo, but was curious so I picked it up when it went on sale. The device is amazing - in that it can detect your voice and what you say even over background noise, clearly play music and speak.Since then I find I use it for regular news and weather updates, to play music, control lights and the temperature via ecobee3 integration, and I'm just getting started. There are thousands of "skills" that you can enable to customize the echo to do what you want.
I bought this, to replace my son's old Kindle Fire. It has lived up to its potential so far.
I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. I love that it has so much memory space, so I can download tons of games and activities to keep him occupied on long rides. I love the 2 year warranty and safety case. He loves it!
This product was purchased for my Grandson. He had a fire 6. He however loves the HD 8. He uses it for music & gaming mostly. Great electronic device.
Great item for book readers. Very happy with purchase as i love to read.
works, that is all that counts
Great tablet for grandson to watch videos. Good sound and picture.
Good and easy. The kids love it and use it for learning and games.
This is an excellent tablet for reading and playing games.
you are able adjust the brightness which is good:)
My mom bought the tablets first for my sisters for Christmas an then my 4 year old wanted one so I purchased one for her. She loves it uses it for games, Netflix, an she is home school so she is able to do her work on the tablet as well
Bought for grandkids. They love playing the games that game with it.
I bought the amazon stick as a bday gift for my cousin. It's pretty easy to use, with its plug and play features
My 3yr old just loves it keeps her occupied for hours
The Amazon - Echo met my expectations for this product
I really was looking for a simple, cheap tablet to play games and mess around on. Screen is really nice and it serves it's purpose well. Video and games both work really well on them. The only real negative about the tablet is that the cameras are not good. I really don't need them so I don't use them and it's not a big deal for me.
I had an older Kindle Paperwhite. Went to visit family & forgot to bring it. Purchased this new one. I love it. My husband is now using my old one. I won't go anywhere without my Kindle.
The functionality of the speaker is great, sound is good.
The speakers on the echo give great output. this smart technology is fun, and I am learning new things that it does every day
This fire box has a lot of applications on the box.
Love this tablet! It does everything! Accesses the web, downloads apps, games, music, movies,. You name it. I also purchased a cover and stylus pens for this tablet. For under $80 you wont find a better deal!
Great take along and travel size. It exactly fits my needs.
I bought this tablet for my daughter for Christmas! It is a lot more than what I expected! I will probably buy another one for my self
I am pleased with my purchase. I use it daily. Ive downloaded several books. It has good picture quality and excellent sound.
Santa brought three of these tablets to our boys and they absolutely love them. What an incredible product and you can't beat the price point. Perfect for the little screen time that they do get and I love that I can control what they have access to. You can even set requirements for reading time in order to unlock the ability to play games. Great tablet.
I've seen this devise from a friend and was really impressed with its performance. It was delightful and fun to see it worked. I bought it at the right tim when it went on sale.
Works great if all you want to do is read and not be distracted by internet.
Easy to set up and use. Good volume and pre loaded lists. Seems to have good range and can be used in a large area.
Was using the Kindle app on my phone and running the battery down and dealing with glare. Paperwhite resolves both these issues. Not a real bookbetter.
Great product haven't streamed 4k content as I don't have a 4k TV but it handle streaming of prime content and my plex server.
I purchased this for my granddaughter to read books and it was perfect.
Excellent tablet for the low price, insurance however would be a waste of money since its 1/3 the cost of the tablet
Great concept and easy for kids to use but it does take a lot of set up in many different areas to work like you want it to. You can't just plug it in and go.
I don't jump on the electronic bandwagon when new things come out, but this thing fascinates me.
Got a great deal on black friday. This is the best affordable tablet for under 100. Was able to get advertisements off from Amazon and installed playstore. Wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. Love the Amazon environment. Want to buy another one if they come down in price again!
Very good value for money. You will not be disappointed if you choose the Fire tv.
Enjoy using the Kindle White paper. It is compact.
I have three amazon products this as well as a kindle and fire stick. This fire TV has the advantage because of the ethernet port. Offers Fox Go for the Yankees but still no TWC compatibility which is why it gets 4 stars out of 5.
Wife liked it and that's what matters. Right? Not a bad tablet for reading for the money.
I have 90 books in my hand at all times, and will be adding more. I can read anywhere, light or dark and don't even need glasses. It was simple to put 30 books on the kindle in minutes. Wishing I had gotten one years ago. My Dad even wants one! I love my Kindle paperwhite!!!
My wife is always on this thing. She loves it. I have it connected with an ethernet cord and hdmi cable and use an SD card. It works really well for a decent price
Great gift for mom. She loves to read and now can continue to do so in more places
Brought 1 for my neice, nephew, and child they ❤ it
I was totally stoked about this product because I was purchasing a new home. However, the property fell through and I returned the product but the little bit I had it...I loved it!!
If you love the Fire Stick you'll love Fire Tv !!!! Fire Tv is a Fire Stick on steroids !!!! Much clearer and loads much faster !!!
Love reading on my Kindle. So many book selections.
Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job.
Easy to navigatePerfect for little ones Buy a screen protector too !
Bought the Kindle Fire for my granddaughter. She saw the one I purchased for another granddaughter and asked for one for her birthday. I like that it's much more than just a reader.
My Fire Tv device is very handy and actually have 2 of them and am thinking about getting my 3rd one.
I ordered the Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders however, what I received is nothing like what is pictured. I received a charger cord that states LG Electronics and Verizon Accessory. I am not certain that these are the same item.
Just what my grandson wanted. Perfect price, can't wait until he opens it
Nice price for a gift idea at the time. Small compact version of Alexa.
I had a kindle 2 and liked it for years. The paperwhite is much smaller, but with a bigger screen. The backlight feature is fantastic!
I tried my new Amazon Fire TV box. Worked as advertised.
If you want to read books in an electronic form you can't beat the paperwhite. You can read it wearing sunglasses, in the brightest sunshine, or the darkest room. Tablets may be more versatile, but they are not as easy to read in various lighting conditions.
So easy to use and my parents just love it and use it all the time!
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I could set her as a user and make it safe for her age. I downloaded books and apps with ease. I'm glad that she is loving her Fire.
I really like the sound of the tab. The only complaint is that you have to push the button every time you have to speak or listen to tab. Unlike the echo, where you just speak and it answers without pushing any buttons. The echo has a cheaper sounding speaker. I'd wait till there is a sale in it before paying full price. Otherwise, it is just like a Bluetooth speaker.
Performance and interface are great!!! And you can add most of Android apps too!!!
No problems, correct output.
This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it's cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.)
I love amazon tv products. Takes 5 minutes to install.
Great sound for music. Easy to install and use. Alexa is good and quick with her answers. I like the news briefs in the mornings.
I had a kindle for years. It finally would not keep a charge. I like the smaller Kindle for my books so it is easy to hold in bed at nite. This is perfect.
I use my Echo everyday! When I want to listen to music or just one song it will play it. I use it for the kitchen a lot! When I want a kitchen timer it works perfect. We will get a group and play games with the Echo also. It is a great overall addition to a home.
While I find myself limited at the moment to playing music and adding to my grocery list, I look forward to expanding my connected home. For what I use it for, it is fantastic. It even works great with answering questions the kids have and responding quickly to needs. It understands fairly well and it hears me throughout the house.
a lot less buffering than the fire stick. this is almost as quick as my Nvidia shield. wish i could download android apps
If you want fast menus and stable streaming, avoid the WIFI only firestick, and get this FireTV. If you want reliable streaming that will not frustrate you, do the work of running an ethernet cable. This box with ethernet is head and shoulders better than a Firestick. Firestick streams well most of the time, but sometimes it struggles and you get errors with either DirecTV Now or PS Vue...forcing a device restart...very frustrating. This box plugged in with an ethernet cable streams perfectly on the same network with the same content 99.9% of the time. I eliminated conflicting frequencies, used 5 Ghz frequencies, have a great router, fast internet, I tried everything. The cure was this device hooked up by ethernet cable. The fact that you can put KODI on this box opens the whole world of movies up to you. You can also load Android apps from your phone to the device with Apps2Fire...I put Blue Iris on my FireTV. If have two of these in my home now, one in the Master Bedroom, and one on my 4K TV. There isn't a ton of 4k content yet, but you can go to Youtube and see some amazing video in 4k there. When I buy a new home at the end of the year I plan to run ethernet cable and have one of these at every television. I cut the cable company off 1 1/2 years ago and have never missed them. Other than internet, I pay $30 a month for PS Vue, and along with KODI I have everything I could possibly want and more. Goodbye Cable TV.
Kindle Voyage is absolutely the best! Easy to read in sunlight!Ordered from Best Buy and it shipped immediately!
The new 7" Kindle Fire is an excellent product for the kids. The compact size makes it easy to travel with and the apps are great. Amazon hit a homerun with this one!
This charger (9W) rapid charger is as described. It works well with both my Fire 7.0 8.9 HDXs. A bonus is the angled usb connector, which fits over the origami case making for a stable and secure connection. A good deal.
its okay it does freeze in a game and have to reboot it. but its okay.
I use it in my commute to watch videos. this serves the purpose for me.pros: 1. cheap2. handy3. Good for kidscons: 1. slow if we have multiple things running2. 8gb is not sufficient3. This has amazon store which doesn't have all apps
was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
has all the apps and functions the kids will ever want..
Lots of features at a great price. I would recommend this product.
This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products
This product is great. I bought it because it was cheaper than paying a cable bill.
The price is AMAZING for the product! Works as well as any tablet, and is the perfect size for your hand bag. Plus, if you are Amazon Prime member - you can download movies to watch. Awesome!
Great tablet great quality i liked and for the price its great
This is my second KIndle. I use Kindle to read fictions. This is awesome!
Not the quickest tablet out there, but it does the job and you can't beat the price. Great for reading books and magazines or light Internet browsing.
Great inexpensive tablet. My wife had an ipad 2 and she has not said once she wants an ipad instead.
The fire tv serves my needs far better than an Apple TV. The ability to side load additional apps is exactly what I needed. The Amazon prime media viewing is a great bonus. For the price the power and memory of this devise far surpasses what I was previously using. I think is the 6th device I have purchased. One for every room and some for friends and family
Replaced older kindle with paper white. Light control Akers reading in dark areas better than non-paper white models.
You have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. The apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. This was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip.
Got this for my nephews and they love love love it!
I own the original Kindle reader. It had several quirks that have been fixed. Pages turn easier, almost all functions are faster, and lighted pages are much easier to read in low light. The only negative so far is the shorter battery life.
Since buying this, we listen to music on it, get information from it. We love it - it has a great sound to it. We would definitely recommend it.
I don't use echo as much as I thought I would, or should I suppose but it's a nice accessory to have. I have some trouble with it responding to my voice correctly but overall it works well.
Convenient, functional, practical device! I loved this product!
Great speaker but u have to have amazon prime to hear songs @ random was unaware so I gave 4 stars 4 that reason over all great sound
This is my third kindle fire. It is lightweight and unobtrusive. I use it mostly for reading however I have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. Overall a good little tablet for the price.
For the price, the Kindle Paperwhite was a great upgrade to the old Kindle. The back light was a plus when using on a plane, and the charged lasted throughout the two week trip.
Very convenient for a great low price. It does its job.
Great buy! Bought it to replace a first generation Kindle.
Exactly what I wanted, great reading at night or in a bright day.
Since I don't like to read the news, I just ask Echo for my news update. And getting the weather for any day for any city and state is a snap!
Capacity limit is my only gripe. Connects quickly and easily to wifi and remembers wifi passwords until you erase them. Books, many are free, especially the ones that you never read in High school. Check email, even works with Bluetooth keyboard. Cant be beat at the price.
love this tablet...very easy to use and read books on
Then what are you waiting for ? If you don't have the money or really not into technology then this product is not for you. I have a iPhone 6s and use Siri not as much as I would like too cuz she doesn't understand me all that great but Alexa? Man she understands every word I say like flawlessly. The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the Skills now even tho it's over 3000 skills a lot of them are junk people made I wish more big developers would make some. Should be well known Trivia games in here even if you had to buy them unless I'm not looking in the right place. The main thing I'll prolly use the Echo for is to listen to music it's real easy to Alexa to play a song and it sounds great
its a nice tablet for the basic uses i need it for such as apple tv and killing time with games.
I love the paper while kindle. I can read at night without a table light on.
I recently purchased this Amazon Fire for my daughter, i like that it has the little accent of a night light, so if we are watching a movie in the dark, she can still use it without illuminating the entire room. features are average, just like any other tablet. It is a little bulky but for a child, it gets the job done. Pretty sturdy when its dropped. Doesnt have much storage, but the good news is you can add your own SD to create more storage.
It is awesome to be able to address "Alexa" and ask her to do things like play a song or turn on the lights while my hands are wet or I am busy.
The fire TV is excellent and allows me to watch in 4k. Works well.
If you are looking to explore what AI can offer in your daily life then Amazon Alexa is your answer.
I bought this as a Christmas gift and it sounds amazing. And of course the integration is wonderful too.
Awsome tablet for the price, baught 4 of them its a steal.
My first kindle has been to about 20 different countries. I just loaded up with some great books and take off on a vacation. I used to load up with actual books and leave them behind as I finished them. I'm on my second Kindle and it's just so convenient to read in bed and easy to turn the pages. It also fits easily into my purse next to my cell phone so I can read any time I have a few minutes.
its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it.
I love my fire TV it's an amazing product I liked it so much I went out and bought fire sticks for the rest of the TVs in my house
I love it I can read anywhere day or night and my kids can read on it too
This was purchased for my mom who is not a computer person. It is very easy for her to use.
Once connected to your phone this is an easy to use and amazing speaker sound quality is awesome and it answers any questions you might have love Alexa even gives me fun ideas when I'm bored
Great when hacked with Kodi- especially with the Royalist!
Alexa is great and performs well. Biggest issues are Bing is a horrible search engine and is inevitably wrong vs Google. Many times it doesn't understand the question or gives wrong answers while OK google gives much better repossess. Also Amazon music is somewhat limited. Should allow ability to play Sonos or iTunes libraries.
This replaced a 4 year old kindle for my 67 year old mother. Extremely glad i went with another Kindle and the fire is awesome! resolution is great! Does everything needed and with ease!
This reader is a great way at a low price to feed your newspaper habit. I save $50 per month on just one newspaper.
Nice
I got this to complete my home automation. and I use it to listen to radio and music. wish it is a bit cheaper.
I love the Tablet. It was for a gift but I have purchased a few of them..
The item works great wish the speeds were faster like the fire box but it still gets the job done just the same.
nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate
I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
For the price it's quite useful, especially for having people over
I bought it for my daughter and she loved it. She is happy to have it and read books on it.
Got two, one for each of my grand daughters. They love the portability and it allows them to both be up at the same time.
Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework
He loves to read, play games and watch movies. Great purchase
I have had nothing but great experiences with Alexa... everything works as expected, the sound quality is good as well as the speech recognition. I would recommend it highly!
I had a tough time finding reviews for this version of the Tamron. Read several reviews comparing the Nikon and the Sigma equivalents to this lens' previous version. The main draw back for the original Tamron 600mm was some design issues like lack of weather proofing. All those seem to be addressed from what I can see and have read. I have not done a high end performance test with color charts dissecting every bit of pixel like some articles I read. I can say that it works very well and the detail I get with my D810 is incredible. I took the below shot at the zoo. The weight can be off putting to some people but that comes with the territory of any large lens and I don't see this one being anything out of the ordinary when it comes to weight. If you are like me and have been eyeing this lens for a while and over researching, do yourself a favor and just go out and get it. You wont be disappointed.
Simple hook up to smart phone and Internet. Love this product and learning more uses for it every day.
Alexa, where have you've been all of my life? I love the Echo. I have one in nearly every room of the house. The sound is amazing and it's great being able to get information, just by asking questions. It even turns my lights on and off.
This product is amazingly faster than the firestick and would recommend this over the stick any day of the week
Absolutely love it, speaker quality is terrible compared to other dedicated bt speakers but does keep this from being a 5 star
Its a good tablet for being only 40 bucks usually people have to buy an expensive tablet for it be good.
As an OEM replacement, I suppose its worth a bit more but this price is excessive. A similar product for my Amazon fire was purchased at Walmart for about 3
I purchased this to read books and check out ebooks from the library. I love it and it's easy to use. This is in color and you can even play games on it. It's small enough to fit in my purse so while I'm at appointments I can read and if my son gets board, he can play games.
My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point.
It allows me to read without using space in my phone.
I bought one and then another one . I have been trying a lot of cheap tablets just to see how they compete with high end tablets . This one so far it's the best of the best . Quality and price wise. I mean 50 dollar ? Really ? I feel like I'm getting paid to take it home . Amazing product you won't be disappointed . Screen is not that good but then again , 50 dollars ? Buy it !!!! Give it a spin you won't be disappointed its very fast for such a small tablet .
Works fine. Carol
Really impressed with the functionality of this device
Easy to read fonts, do not have to buy an external light, can read in bright sunlight or in the dark. Easy to add books from Amazon Kindle. It's nice to carry your whole library with you in your purse.
My children love these kindles! They are so much better then the 1st ones we had & the price is better as well!
It's better than the 1st version kindle with Internet access
It was just a few weeks ago that I was bemoaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Tap! Can I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Alexa. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automated. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup.Read more
nice size screenlike feachers included storage very goodexcellent color clarity
This makes it so much better to charge the kindle. It's small and easy to put in a case along with the cord and kindle.
I love it, only thing sometimes I gotta keep repeating the wake up name to get it started, but after that, it's great
I love my Alexa I can ask it questions and it gives me the answers I can use the timer on it it's pretty handy.
Runs great, no complaints. Nice size screen, nice specs all around. Cant do any better for 50 bucks
amazon fire tv, i use it a lot, it is worth the price it cost..
This children's kindle is great! I can't say anything negative about this product! Perfect for my 3 yr old and even my older kids who are teens like to play with it! I highly recommend buying this if you're considering any educational products for kids. You won't be disappointed!
does everything i need read lots of books from local library check out my email and facebook and hooks up nice to my wirelees
I bought this as a replacement for an older model Kindle my father wore out. Unfortunately, he cannot remember the email and password for the older model, so I cannot transfer the thousands of books he has to the new Kindle. Always write down that important information somewhere, it will make life a lot easier!
Amazon is a cool products, a talking toy not just for kids. Use it daily.
The whole family is using it. Music, Bluetooth speaker, questions, game times, sports scores. Love the portability.
Echo should be in everyone's home! It provides so much entertainment. Music, Weather forecasts, shopping list and something to help organize your home.
This does just what it claims and also has a great speaker so you do not need to link with a sound system to be able to enjoy! We compared this to google and with the speaker there was no comparison this one is so much better.
The Kindle paperwhite is the perfect e-reader. The screen resolution, size, and capacity make a complete package. If your objective is to read, this is the optimal product. If you want to play games or are enamored with color for magazine viewing, do not purchase this product.
It's a great working machine fast speed streaming. You are able to install external apps and get a lot of shows all in all I'm very satisfied with this device
It was really nice to be able to find this at retail, in a store. The one we had been using died while on a trip. It made getting a new one really easy. They even carried both a white as well as a black coloured model.
We liked this product a lot! Web surfing and Skype is great
Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.
Was initially concerned that it would take a lot to set up the Echo but it was easy to get it all going and very easy to use. Really glad we went ahead and made the purchase.
This is one for the living room. And my other one Is for travel one.
One of the best items I have bought! Just wonderful we use it all the time.
Thank You. Great Product for all ages. Thank You!!
This cover is a replacement for the initial cover that broke my kindle framewhere the top hinge goes into the Kindle. The metal on the original hinge system was too light weight to withstand having the cover fold all the way back on the Kindle and after just over a year resulted in the hinge becoming bent up towards the frame and it cracked the frame on my Kindle.I understand this new Kindle cover is supposed to have corrected that problembut the hinge system looks identical to the one that was on my old cover. I hope that over time, again, about a year plus it won't crack the frame in the same place again on my new Kindle.I am so thankful that Amazon replace both my Kindle and the book cover as a result of this problem.I would recomend that after about 6 months use it would be wise to remove the cover from your Kindle and see if the top hinge is beginning to bend upwards towards the frame and if so contact Amazon before the frame of your Kindle breaks where the top hinge inserts into your Kindle.
picked up this fire tablet for the simple reason of reading ebooks purchased through kindle rather than on my phone. it's small enough I can stash it in my bag and easy on the wallet if anything happens to it. go ahead and pick up a case for it and maybe a glass screen protector for added piece of mind
Sound quality is pretty good if you want it to play background music, but I still prefer Sonos for this purpose. Alexa is useful for controlling the widest range of smart home products, but it's not backed by Google Home's superior search intelligence, so it isn't that great for asking in-depth questions of it. There are comparisons of these products out there, so take a look before making a decision. Since I mostly wanted it for home control, it suits my need.
Turning,sometimes the pages turn when your not aware of it. The battery length is much better.
I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!
I was needing an additional streaming device for Spotify. This handles exactly what I need.
My daughter hasn't put it down since Christmas. We're both in love! It's very easy for her to operate (she's 2) and very easy to set up. It's a win win for both parent and child.
I've had Alexa for a few months already. I have her controlling my front door and all the lights in my house. I'm slowly getting my house to a smart house and she's a very good addition
Got the most bang for the buck with this tablet. I would've given it 5 stars if it had Google play on it. Otherwise, it was quick with some of the apps that I downloaded on it.
My 2 girls ages 2 and 5 absolutely love these tablets.
It's a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty!
This was a gift and is being enjoyed. Glad I purchased it
I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this
We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It's way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing.
I love my amazon fire tv I take it with me everywhere I travel.
I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much
Great product... One of the few to offer 4K streaming services.
I have recently purchased a 4K tv and wanted to get the best experice out of watching anything this fire tv has great screen quality and sound with no delays
If you are planning on buying a amazon fire stick, reconsider and buy the fire tv. Far superior, better display and faster processor.
I wanted a reliable tablet for my 8 year old son. This one was recommended to me after another tablet had charging issues. This has functioned well since purchase.
This is a great tablet especially for the price. The only draw back is that I could not load an app that I needed for work because Kindle does not accept google play apps.
Same content but better. I wanted another one for my other tv.
I would recommend this tablet , I bought a few other tablets for my younger kids same price , the orbo and wimo but unlike those.. This tablet runs super smooth, install all your xbmc's and kodi's .. Great screen very clear, picture seems better than my iphone 6s plus #shrugs
I love this paper white! It's light weight, easy to use, and the battery lasts for a very long time with use. I only wish it were cheaper, but the price wasn't bad.
This is a much better alternative to apple tv.you can do so much more with this powerful machine
Great value. Easy to set up. Light weight nd very portable. Will provide hours of entertainment for my child.
i bought this to replace a old apple tv works great
I wanted a tablet that would be easy to carry for reading. This exactly meets my needs and expectations. Great tablet
It's great only issue is wish the o.s was more open and you could delete more of the things you dont want
Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
Makes any tv a smart tv! Lightning fast 4 gig processor.
Perfect for the kids to use and I loved the price.
I heard about the Echo but thought it was another electronic gimmick I really didn't need (hard for an e-junkie to say no). My brother visited a few weeks ago and convinced me it was worth it so we found one at the local Best Buy and bought it. It's odd how many times we walk by now and ask questions. Growing up decades before the internet, I wonder how dangerous I would have been using it when I was younger. Ah well.
I was pleasantly surprised when I got this as a gift. Unlimited fun.
Had older model, that you could text to speech, this one hasn't. Liked the smaller size, but having to buy a different cover! Still getting used to shelf quite different from my 4 year old model.Paper white is nice reading.
The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great.
The Amazon fire TV is a great item to stream online content
The headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. That is why I am giving the product only 2 stars. Otherwise, the screen is great.
Awesome to have, verry convient. I would like to have one in every room.
but the skills could use a bit of a refresh. can't remember all the commands as skills require certain keywords. the whole point of amazon echo is to be able to say anything.still fun and great if you have a lot of home automation gadgets.
Excellent value great apps and movies. the price was perfect.
So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.
Super easy to use. Has Alexa for voice commands. We've purchased 2 additional boxes for our other tv's.
Alexa can make your life easier and answer all those questions you are wondering about when sitting around with your friends and family;Great to play music also and answer sports, Weather and trending topic questions
Great picture and worth the money. Great for even older TV's.
I purchased this tablet to leave in the kitchen to use for pinterest recipes. It is perfect for that, and small enough to easily tuck away in a cabinet when not in use.
Fire tv is fast and easy to use. It is easy to navigate.
quick shipping great price..... great product..... all great... very happy with the kindle....
This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the "Amazon Android" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!
Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.
Good product that does the basics. Too bad you have to buy a specific light control or security system to make this useful. My Smart TV's are connected to the internet, so why not control them too? But I was impressed when I asked "Alexa, whats on TV for the Olympics tonight?" and the response was Swimming at xx time, Gymnastics at yy time. Far more info than the TV guide on screen showing only a 4 hour block on NBC. It is the beginning of things to come.
It's has all of the best services and now with Alexa and 4K it's even better
Its comfortable to read, and it's compact. and light. I got case to go with it. I would recommend it.
It a great gadgets for the kids to stay busy reading and playing or even watching their shows
Really great for room not close to your internet router
works and is light
fits my needs, love to read and it just fits my hands and is great and easy to read
Bought these for my kids and they just love them. The different color choices give it a nice personalized touch
The Echo is quick to setup, easy to move around the house and outside to listen to music. I love my new friend Alexa and all the features that come with this product.
Love my Kindle Paperwhite. Very easy on your eyes when reading, even in low light.
I am just learning all the possible functions of my Kindle Fire, but it already does what I bought it for. I hope that I will get more enjoyment as I explore it more fully.
Excellent product, I use it for everything, especially for music and weather.
Easy set up, effortless, bout one for my 80 year old father and he uses it without any help.
Easy to install. Easy set up. Would recommend to friends.
This was for an employee appreciation event, the prize winner was very excited about winning the Amazon Fire!
I bought 3 of these for my children for christmas and they love them! Great tablet for game apps they have had a blast playing theirs! So far we haven't had any technical issues such as lagging etc. I would highly recommend this to a mom of kids that love to play games this is a perfect purchase for you!
Amazon TV is on par with Apple TV. I especially like toe original programming that Amazon offers.
I have both the FIRESTICK and AMAZON TV. I choose to to get the AMAZON TV for better streaming and live channels. Thus far I am satisfied.
Great assistant. Can handle the lights, music and questions
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7yr old granddaughter and it's very easy for her to use.
The Fire Stick is inexpensive, easy to set up and really responsive. Ended up buying a few of these for the entire family.
I bought this to replace my failing Kindle 3 (Keyboard). I absolutely love it! The only con I have found is battery life with airplane mode off. It drains rather quickly with it off, turn airplane mode on and it's great!
I read the camera specs which is what caught my eye and they are great - takes great picture but the "zoom" feature quickly distorts actual picture.
This is a really good tablet for young kids to play on.
Works great! This tablet has a great picture and moves much quicker than I expected.
I am very happy with my kindle 7, excellent, useful.
Value to the Product.Useful if you have amazon prime account and it is a good value for the money spent.I bought it for my kid. My kid like it.
Good screen resolution. Keep wifi off and adjust brightness for best battery life.
Great, love it lots of fun and great movies and speed.
Not sure of quality. His first Kindle Fire would no longer charge properly. It was cheaper to get a new one rather than attempt to have the old one fixed. He has already had a problem with this one charging properly; however, I believe the problem might have been with the charging cord and not the tablet itself.
What a great new ffiend... very responsive ,, have alexa handling all my home automation now too .. great add
Everything I thought it would be and more. You need Amazon prime to really unlock the potential it has but it's a great buy for a great price!
I can pretty much use voice activation on many things in my house some twiking is needed but I like it ...
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my grandson. He loved it!
works perfect for my 4k tv and the voice command comes in handy
I bought this item as a gift for my 15 year old niece for her birthday. She loves it and takes it with her almost everywhere she goes. Now that you can talk through it to use as a telephone it's even more fun to use. I was watching the prices go down and one weekend sale in April, Best Buy were practically giving them away, the online prices were so reasonable one weekend!!
I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it!
Good deal and great product. An affordable tablet from a well known trusted brand
This tablet was a gift for my office's white elephant exchange. Also bought one for my boyfriend. Great, inexpensive tablet for Amazon centric people.
The Amazon fire is a perfect size for viewing videos, reading books and playing games. Small enough to fit in a bag or purse.
Great for cable-cutters! It works with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Plex and so many other video services. Highly recommend.
no live tv but most of everything else is available and much cheaper than cable! We're saving over $100 a month by canceling cable and only keeping internet
I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price.
We bought the box to see if it would make sense to dump cable. The ease of use is one sell, but the fact I can watch anything and not worry about junk sold it for me.
The Kindle Fire was a perfect gift for my wife. She has not been a big fan of newer electronics in general and needed something compact, affordable and very easy to use.
Alexa can do almost everything & is constantly learning & that's just the app. The echo itself is fantastic speaker when player music. It's almost lifelike & is seems to be like the Star Trek shipboard computer. Its great for the kids of any age to help with homework. Its great to take notes, create shopping list, music, or questions of any kind. In fact it'sgreat for most anything... It's simply awesome
best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!!
Great item for my kids are you recommend it to anyone that wants to replace an iPad for their kids
Got this for my living room for my kids to interact with. They love asking Alexa questions and the price was great for what it does. Also have a few Dots and hoping to be able to join all speakers as one in the future
For Christmas I bought to for my children and they love it.
Got this gift for my girlfriend daughter and she loves it good deal thanks
Great little reader, long battery life, light weight, easy on the eyes, I use it at the gym.
This is amazing for helping you keep track of stuff. Also fun to just talk to Alexa.
It works well it takes time for it to know your vocabulary
Had a kindle fire before. Glad I switched. Easy to use and I love being able to read outside in the sun. Battery life is excellent!
The amazon tables were great Christmas gift the kids love them
Amazing for travel or being able to read when your partner turns out the lights.
Use my echo everyday! Don't know how I managed without it.
Bought 3 Amazon fire tablet on Black Friday and the family love it
Bought for at home use, haven't been around enough to learn it
If you want an e book reader that is light, easy on the eyes (even in the dark) with a no-glare are screen, then you will love this one. It works well even in bright sunlight!. Battery life is great! (days) My only issue is than I have not had any luck using my phone (Galaxy s5)as a hotspot to download books. Very frustrating that it will not recognise it for wifi connection, even manually typing it in! It's browser capabilities are also a joke. I shop with my phone or laptop then drive to a wifi location to download books. Not ideal. That said, it is a wonderful "reader" even though it is overpriced! Good luck shopping :-)
Works great and very happy with it. We arte going to get another soon. We used zip ties on the back of a TV so you don't even know I it there. I prefer to add this to a TV then buy a smart TV.
excellent product, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends.
I also have a Nook but a ton of glare. I can read my Kindle Paper White anywhere! Love it.
It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person.
I love my fire TV. I use it mainly for watching movies and TV shows. We also use it for Pandora listening to music. You can also side load applications that aren't available directly through the App Store. I cut the cable cord and haven't looked back!
I really like the Amazon Echo. My kids love to play games with it and music.
This is a great starter tablet for an 11 year old.
Bought these for Christmas, and it was the hit of the gifts! The kids and adults loved them. The adults appreciated the ability to monitor the fires, liked to use them also.
Paid 50 bucks for it and with that you can't complain. Great for a general use tablet
My wife had a Nook e-reader that was getting old and also used her iPhone 5 for reading. I thought it would be a very good reader for her and she loves it, along with the other capabilities the tablet offers. She has been very happy with it and you cannot beat the price for the features the tablet offers.
We are still learning how to use the Echo device but it has lived up to all our expectations. Easy to setup and use.
Great value for the money. Good for checking email and browsing from time to time.
A little slow loading compared to my HDX which just had the screen broken, so needed a less expensive replacement. Great for reading books of course!
Price is great for the purchase and the quality of the picture is great
Great tablet for someone who don't have any experience with electronics.
Great to set timers, play music, look up scores, etc. I wish it could access my weather app (dark sky) when I asked about rain to give me a more precise answer.
Not much to say except that it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
Good for price, could have bought android tablet but it was no name for the same price. So went with it and my 5 year old really likes it. Just be careful of putting your credit card in. My son charged a bunch of games before I caught it. I thought he was just downloading free apps.
Tablet is good for all around use. My kids use most and like to buy music and books through Amazon.
Bought 5, 1 for each of my kids. So far so good. No issues with anything.
I love Amazon now there's so much functionality especially with video. This works great and the quality is amazing
Purchased the Echo for my wife for Christmas. She loves to use it throughout the day asking questions, playing music and adding items to her shopping list. It is very useful and also easy to set up and use.
Great tablet for beginners to use. Easy operating system
This case works great. It was exactly what I was looking for.
Music, lights, jokes, news---Alexa does it all. Caution though, once you buy Alexa you may begin to spend more money on add-ons such as controlled lights.
This is a great addition to all smart home devices.
Very low quality tablet. It lags on games. But what do you expect for $50? However, you can still do most things you'd expect to do with a tablet.
Tablet is ok. It does display ads on the lock screen, that you can't opt out of, to my knowledge. But for the price, I can't really complain. I bought it at the $35 BF price. I wouldn't let me download Instagram for some reason either.
Easy set up. Easy to use and great assistance to have. It's like having the Internet as your own personal butler.
Great tablet for the money!! Easy to use! Easy to set up. Great for reading or browsing the Internet.
I got this to replace my iPad. The battery is decent, the quality is good but the sound/volume could be a little better. It doesn't quite get as loud as I would like so I just use a speaker with it. Overall, for the price, you can't really beat it.
I was a hesitant buyer of these devices until the echo dot was given to us as a gift. It is fun to use, but we wanted a louder and better speaker. So that's why we bought this. Happy so far.
Great Deal for An Entry Amazon tablet. Unbeatable entry level tablet for use in the Amazon eco system.
Great products. Works perfect. Get to watch a lot of shows and movies.
Alexa is pleasant, polite , & very quick to respond to requests such as weather , music , or even jokes ;
The tablet is up to date technology. My daughter surf the internet fast and no slow download.
we love this tablet and the price. awesome deal. it was so good we going back to get two more. it's amazing .. can't say no more except get you one
I bought this for my 7 yo and I highly recommend it. You can set a timer for learning activities they have to meet before they can play games. Easy to use and the size is perfect.
Works great.Great buy.Wouldn't have anything else.
I do not like the layout. I want to remove stuff from the screen and can't . I don't like some of the lock out features like playing songs for the kids. i do not like all the advertisements. I don't like the screen doesn't go dark when i want it to such as when music is playing. I liked the samsung
I would recommend this tablet for parens. My kids love this tablet.
Small unit provides excellent quality and portability is a huge plus.
This is a nice item. I recommend this to everyone.
It works bet well and my son enjoys using it for music and questions
Perfect tablet for my son. No complaints. Super fast shipping!
Works great for checking the weather, checking your calendar, playing music and asking questions.
There is no doubt this is the best available e-reader in the market.I was struggling with tablet vs reader but eventually ended up with reader as it gives the best reading experience.
I believe this is the best Amazon device because of the portability. Quality seems good. Works well with no problems so far. It's a great portable Bluetooth speaker with alexa.
Now the best memory for facts in the household without ever being smug about it. Sometimes she doesn't know the answer and that makes her even more appealing.
This is my first streaming video device, and I did a good bit of research before buying. The video quality is excellent and the operator interface is easy to use.
Bought as a gift for dad. He loves it. Easy to use.
I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed.
Its bigger than a phone but smaller than an Ipad. I like it alot though and it does what I want it too.
I have had a blast since I purchased this Amazon Fire tv. I had issues with the remote but after calling they immediately sent me a replacement. Great service and I am considering reducing my cable now since I can do so much cheaper through this item now.
Use it daily. Because of its streaming capabilities and how clear it is I'm saving a ton of money from not having cable
My first dedicated streaming box and it works great. Plenty of apps to watch my shows and the remote is simple to learn. Also having access to my Amazon purchased movie and prime shows/movies is a nice bonus.
Very satisfied with this product ! Works great! Does all I need
I am purchasing this tablet for my younger cousin as a starter tablet. But we will see how well it holds up with his rigorous activity and game playing.
Perfect to have in the kitchen for news, music and recipes. Love it.
Couldn't be happier works as expected and price was fair.
I can't say enough about this so I will just say I love it! Very loud! Louder than my Bose Soundlink Mini speaker and better sound quality. However, because it is so loud it doesn't catch what you're trying to say if the volume is too loud. Also, I'm Mexican so I have a hard time getting it to understand what music to play when it comes to music with Spanish titles. Other than those two things though, I have no complaints. It is very easy to use and was very easy to set up.
This kindle is much better than the original version. The back light makes it easy to reader in low light.
Love this hardware!! Only issue is occasionally you have to do a hard reset of the box, I was getting messages my bandwith wasn't high enough and couldn't watch streaming movies. Once I turned off/turned on...back to normal. That's the only issue so far. Otherwise highly recommend and love it!
Got it for the kids and they love it. I am also a prime member as well there are so many great things for members, movies, apps, games and shows that are free. If you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one.
Recently purchased this amazon fire box. I am still learning how to work everything. I am enjoying it so far. You do have to have a Netflix account and alot of the other applications to use alot of things. However, their is a work around for everything lol. I will possibly invest in more of these down the line and maybe get my family to finally cut the cord also.
Works great.
Love my fire tv. Much better and faster than the fire stick.
My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books.
The unit seems to have a sturdy build and it loads and unloads very quickly
Bought as a Christmas Gift. I think my grand daughter will be very please.
Love it , so easy to use and you can easily just talk to the control
Great for kids with parental features or they would download apps likes crazy
This is by far the best kindle to come out. Backlight is great!!
I bought tablets for my grandson's and they are perfect! I pre-loaded it with games and videos for kids their age (3 and 4) before giving it to them for Christmas. Well worth the money.
The Kindle Fire is easy and afordable for books,games, movies all on one device. I have owned 2 other Kindles in the past and will purchase another one when the time comes to replace the one i have now.
He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics
Amazon Kindle pleased my lady !! She is very happy with the Kindle and with the GSP added im not worried about it crabbing out either.
Finds movies and shows quickly. Very easy to set-up
Great for streaming movies and amazon, easy set up! Would defiantly recommend this product.
This little box packs quite a powerful punch, stream all your movies and shows, especially great with prime membership. .
It's perfect for reading and even watching movies. The only thing that is not so great is taking pictures with the tablet. They do not come out as clear as I would like them. But overall perfect for what I use it for. That's mostly reading and watching movies.
Disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading. Size and weight is great.
So far we like. Wish I could control tv. It's lil expensive but seems to work great. Decent speakers as well.
I really am enjoying my kindle. Im glad I got rhis one.
Easy to use, easy to read the screen, light weight.
This tablet is great for a child. It will stand up to accidental drops and has just enough expandability for future use. I give it 5 star!
My wife owns one, so we bought one for my mom who is not tech-savvy, and she seems to be having great success with it so far. Had to buy a case separately because for some reason Best Buy doesn't have any avail in store or even on-line, but the Fire itself is great for light users.
This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful.
Great product I bought it for my mom for mothers day
Bought this as a gift for grandson who loves to read. Easy to set up and easy to use. Love it.
Bought this for my husband primarily so he could get the Wall Street Journal. It works great and he loves that it holds a charge, nice size, durable, great resolution, etc. it turned out to be a great gift!
I purchased this to watch Amazon Prime programing and Playstation Vue.This is way faster than the Fire Stick. Although I still have occasional glitches I can't for sure say its from the Fire TV versus the services.
I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails.
This is the first electronic purchase in awhile that my wife loves too. Alexa is great. She does whatever you want. We love it for playing music. I love it for news and updates on various things such as stock market info and weather. Would recommend it for everyone that has Amazon prime.
i got to say that love it!! makes it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my needs.
Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.
Good for a basic entry tablet. Plus u can upgrade the memory on it which is a plus.
We bought this tablet for my four year old nephew and it works great! We love how it can be set up for different users!
This Tab is not for grown ups... neither for work nor for entertainment... the Amazon Fire OS has a long way to go..!!
I have both the Kindle Voyage and the low end Kindle Fire.While the $50.00 Fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the Kindle Voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. Now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive Fire, such as color and online with Wifi; as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.Truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the Paperwhite. It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device.
This device is pretty no-frills, but for a 7 year old boy, it works great and is awesome. It's sturdy, plays apps well, and I don't have to freak out every time he drops it. I'm sure it will break eventually (my son will find a way), but for $50, I'll take my chanes.
I purchased a Galaxy phone and received the Fire tablet for free. I do use it to read books to my son. He mostly uses it to play his games. It does the job!
This was purchased to replace the fire stick. If you're debating between the fire stick and the fire TV, get the fire tv box. Waiting for the fire stick to power on and connect to wifi, or trying to type anything with a directional pad wastes too much time!
This Kindle Fire is lighter than my old one. The speed is great & all apps load very quickly. I also like that it comes in different colors.
Real easy to use. Great price. Got 2 of them. One for me and one for my friends son. He uses it to download free books to read, and games to play.
It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it
I just love this toy, with time she will get better
We truly enjoy our Fire tv. It gives us a wide range of viewing from tv shows to movies
It's a good little tablet. I don't know if I would get this as my personal main tablet but the whole idea was for my son. He's loving it!
Love this product as it help makes my home into a smart home with added security.
Its small , compact, convenient to put into purse.
I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life.
Not the best tablet, but for the price on black friday I couldn't resist. Great for a couple of teens.
Great product! Easy integration with Samsung Smartthings hub and music apps such as Spotify. It also delivers great sound with the size of the speaker.
Overall, very easy to install. I use stick on velcro to attach to back of TV to keep out of sight. Many apps available very clear picture and sound easily connected with one HDMI.
Compared to the rest this is amazing especially the price.
I love to read and I find by downloading books on my kindle is so easy. I love it.
There are free an paid games get the stick w/voice
Basic and no frills,exactly what i wanted for travel :-)
Bought this tablet at my local store . The nephews love it
I m enjoy having Alexia around. Shes my DJ, Comedian, and news caster all in one.
Sad that I had to replace my original Kindle due to inability to recharge the unit. Now with this model the charge plug is a pain to use. Kindle please work on your designs.
This box has it all! Does 4K and also has a super fast Quad Core Processor. Has great WIFI AC, and also has the Ethernet plug in. Great Streaming machine, but the best thing about it is the PRICE!
I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising.
Does everything you need the price is as good as can be expected
I have purchased 4 Kindle Fire 7 tablets for my grandsons, and they love playing games on them whether they are educational games or just-for-fun games.
This is a good tablet for your everyday used!!!!!!
Easy setup, love that its wireless and its fun talking to Alexa as she gives excellent information.
Good product works amazing . Works awesome from home .
Love this. Easy to use. Love that you can purchase external memory card for this tablet. I am excited to say I purchased 5 of these for family members and I am happy with the tablet.
This tablet is perfect for kids. It is inexpensive and durable.
I really enjoy the Echo and the power of Alexa. There are so many different skills that is has something for everyone and while it is used for home automation there are many things you can do with it if you don't have any other connected home devices. The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is that the speaker quality could be a little better for music. I competes in quality with bluetooth products in the $100-$150 range but systems like the Bose sound link mini are still superior in sound quality.
A little slow but overall good first tablet for kids
Enjoying my Alexa very much. A very cool idea that works
Perfect color, size, and price for our family needs.
I have been a user of Roku and Apple TV before and I absolutely love the Fire TV. What prompted me to change from Roku was the availability of Playstation Vue. We are cord cutters and Vue is a better value than Sling TV.The Fire TV works well and has most all the channels we used on our old Roku. The only thing that doesn't work 100% is Vudu or other UltraViolet streaming services. The closest thing is Flixster, but some of the titles don't carry over right away. Most of the movies come through just fine, but the Flixster app on the Fire TV doesn't seem to bring over the TV shows I have purchased. Other than that, it works very well. Of course, if you watch a lot of Prime TV or use Amazon's Instant Video service you will really love the integration here.
Wife purchased she said does what she needs, loves it.
I love the Amazon fireTV, It's very fast & user friendly, I will purchase more of them for Christmas girts.
Great product kindle fire got one for mom and dad for Christmas presents nice to add storage
This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we've made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice!
Wag glad I purchased the Amazon Echo. Easy to set up and link with the two iPads in our home. Use it to play music from ITunes as well as the IPad. Let's me do a quick check on the weather and a joke of the day. Impressed at how sensitive it is as I can speak with it from anywhere in my condo every with background noise. Heartily recommend it to my friends and family.
Really happy with this new Kindle and the fact that I can read at night and not have to use a reading light.Highly recommend
This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value.
Sweet product by Amazon, as usual. It's legit, most definitely
The Fire TV was easy to set-up and we have had no problems. I do suggest unplugging when not in use as the box does heat up...just to be safe.
Easy to use. Lightweight and just right for a child. Screen provides great pics and connects easily to internet. Great buy!
Have enjoyed it since we set it up the first night. Kids love to ask random questions every morning and the jokes are actually funny.
The paper white is a great kindle that easy to handle and use. Bright screen is perfect for sunlight
After having worn out one Kindle and discovered Kindle Fire can't be read in sunlight, I decided on the Kindle paperwhite. Infinitely readable and the light adjusts. I love the new Bookerly font
Bought it as a gift for a family member and they use it everyday. Will probably buy one for myself.
Easy to use. Easy to download games. Kids love the color options.great for school work.
Love my new kindle fire. Gives me a tablet at a great price. Highly recommend this kindle
Great electronic product - would definitely recommend it
This is much faster than the fire stick. Streams clear every time.
THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR STREAMING .THE PRICE IS THE BEST PART .IT IS EASY TO SETUP.I HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT.
Much better than I expected for such a great price.
I like that I can sync my email and now, actually use the Prime streaming video service. Yes, I know I could use the app on my Ipad, but like I said, I like it all packaged neatly here.
I love my Amazon fire tv box! I use it for everything u could dream of! It works amazing with a prime membership and has many different uses like playing games and what not!! It looks amazing on a 4k tv..
This tablet is simple and easy to use. The only problem I've had is putting in a memory card. The tablet kept pushing it back out, had to read reviews online in order to input it properly.
Wish I would of purchased sooner , one of best item
Haven't used it much, but so far I like it! Mostly use to play games on.
My family really enjoys the Amazon Echo. We have it set up to automate our home and remind us of things that are in our schedules. We picked up the Echo and two of the Echo Dots. We love to play our music and control our television by just simply telling it to do so. Locate your phone with one of the skills. I purchased one for my mother so she can use My Buddy if she gets hurt and call for someone if she can't get to her phone. There is a lot of potential for development in home automation as well as the connected automobile.
Great product for my kids to read. Was an Xmas gift.
Was bought as a gift. the person says that it works great and they say that does just what they wanted it to do and it is liked it really well.
I use it to control the smart devices. It works well. No problem about discovering the devices. The loudness is more than enough for my living room. Furthermore, it allows the Bluetooth devices to connect to it.
I have the Echo and bought this one for the bedroom. Great alarm clock.
Works great and enjoy using it. No problems yet. Might get another one soon.
Love being able to just ask it to do things however there is a learning curve. You have to also kind of teach it what you want.
It was a gift and can I say, it was a hit. When I go to my daughters house she is always telling Alexa to do something
This is a good basic tablet bought it for my 4 year old. Only complaint is that it doesn't have one of the most popular games ( despicable me) which my son loves so he still have to use mine for that. Plz update software Amazon!
The Kindle Fire is el Fuego! That means it's good for what I ask it to do. I watch movies, read books, search the internet for ingredients that allow me to make delicious oatmeal cookies, and when in a pinch, this thing is just the right size to serve the cookies on also!
Got this as a gift forMy son as he wanted to have Netflix in his room.
I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting.
Very good experience okay at the Niles Ohio location. Great price for children 6 to 11 that aren't real responsible. Did not buy warranty on the tablets priced a little high for something that was as priced as low as they were.
This is by far the best streaming device I've ever owned!
This was a Christmas gift for a family member. He absolutely loved it!
I'm truly elated with the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet. I originally purchased this product specifically to attached to my Tablet Holder on my Nordic Track Treadmill, which already has a built-in tablet. However, I was so taken back by the versatility of the Fire HD 8 tablet that I decided to use the tablet as my everyday "walk-about" computer tablet instead on placing on my treadmill which I only use 1 to 3 times per week. I totally recommend the Fire HD 8 Tablet which on sale cost about $69.00.
its really good and product and quality...user friendly to kids
The Echo is a very cool device that is simple to use! Alexa is very responsive.
Two different friends (households) told us how much they ejoy the Echo so we purchased ours!!! It is fun to use near our computer and we love it!!! We are telling other friends about our experience!!!
Don't let the 8GB prevent you from buying this Amazon tablet! Once you insert a Micro SD card, the tablet literally saves everything to the Micro SD. Be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab. For Forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with Amazon Underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in-app purchases... yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! Note that this thing comes with ads... but they only appear on the lock-screen and actually aren't that bad. They are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. Other than that, you'll want to have a PRIME membership so you can take advantage of the PRIME videos and what not. I recommend getting at least 32GB Micro SD (I believe it supports up to 128GB) to store pictures, videos, music etc... obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.The pictures it takes are OK... good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.Screen quality is pretty good... not sharp and crisp like a Retina screen, but I was able to read my Kindle books just fine. The viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel cross-eyed like some cheaper tablets out there.Battery Life is very good on this tiny tablet... something like 4-5 hours with normal use. Videos and Games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game I've thrown at it so far.If you have kids, the Free-Time app is very cool... you have to pay a small subscription (like 2 bucks a month or something with PRIME) but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.Well, that's all I can think of... this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality... if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden.
It works great specially whit the new ligth frature
Wish it could do more without subscribing to Amazion Prime. Bought this for my 19 year old daughter. She likes it a lot, but I think it could be improved by not tying it to a monthly subscription service.
I bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas Present. She is a avid reader and has been using our ipad to read online library books. She asked me for a nook reader, but after seeing the fire....it was a no brainer to go in that direction. it is used everyday and she loves it.
Super fast compared to the stick. This gets used all the time and saved me money.
I'm still learning about this product..so far it has been very useful to me.
Where has this been all these years! Best purchase ever!
Would purchase again. Great product. It is easy to install. You tube was very helpful to me with the installation of my Amazon Fire stick.
Replaced my wife's standard Kindle with the paper white edition. She loves the backlit screen.
Grandson loves it . He loves to play games and watch movies
My granddaughter enjoy being able to download her games and music and it's real easy for her being 8 years pld.
It works exactly for what I need it to, I like that I can have all of my streaming programs on one device.
I already reviewed this once. But does doing this mean I get more reward points? Of course I spend $1400.00 there the other day, and still haven't seen any certificates from it, so not sure the points are worth anything anyway.
So happy with this Kindle! It's very easy to use, lightweight so you can carry it in your bag like you would with a paper book, except here you have an entire library with you.It's easy to download books, you can set up a wish list, read several books at the same time and you never loose your page.The screen lights are fantastic when you read in the dark, and there's absolutely no glare when you read in the sun.The only drawback is that I thought I would be able to purchase books on any amazon site so that I could read books in French if they're not available on the U.S. site, and it turns out you can't. You can only purchase the ebooks from the country your Kindle is set up. That was a real disappointment, as I had read some reviews before buying it where they said you could...Overall, I absolutely love it and if you're a book worm like i am, than I would absolutely recommend it. I would actually recommend it to any one.
We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 6 year old. He loves it. It's durable and reliable.
Makes reading outdoors enjoyable and I spend more time at the beach!
Great to search songs, check out news n weather. Ask information about a subject you are searching. Grandkids are forever playing with it!
I am satisfied with my tablet. I bought three of them for my grandchildren for christmas. I like the games and reading. And I really like the parental feature on it especially how things are in the world of the internet. Its always good to know that someone else is watching your back!
I would buy this product again; would also recommend it to friends and family.
I'm happy with the product, all works perfect, but the Best Buy employee attitude I don't like, I'm ask for the product and he told me if you don't see here we don't have it, and I ask another employee and he show me the item from another place, a very different attitude.Thank you !!
Good brand awesome use for home entertainment or out and about
This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend
Echo is learning everyday and its uses daily, the fact that's it Bluetooth is awesome.
Great just really great. It's like Trump is talking about my amazon fire box
bought this product online and less than an hour i was able to pick the product in store. super love it!
Tablet works well for a kid, easy for our almost 4 year old to navigate between activities. Hard to beat with the case and 2 year warranty.
We love our Amazon Echo. The kids love asking Alexa to play songs and pairing this with a portable battery for the Echo is a perfect way to move Alexa around the house. Highly recommend getting this over the Dot
Enjoying this product and anxious to learn more about it.
I purchased the Echo for my husband as an early Christmas present. He loved it! We used it all during the holiday season to play holiday music. We use it every morning to check the weather. We also bought a smart plug and use the Echo to turn on our table lamp as we walk in the door in the evenings. We compete against each other in Jeopardy every day - he usually wins! As a result of my experience with the Echo, I bought 4 more for Christmas gifts and my enthusiasm for the Echo resulted it one being under many of my friends' families Christmas trees!
I do not have a connected home, but the Echo is fun to use. More skills are added by Amazon each week. The accuracy of the Echo understanding my voice commands are excellent! Unfortunately, only the Dot can stream via Bluetooth. I would give the Dot a look when it begins to be generally available...
Alexa is working well and learning more every day.
The paperwhite model has a very clear screen and backlight so I can be used in most lighting conditions. The manual is an ebook which not everyone will be fond of. My only complaint is that it includes a USB cable but does not include a charger in the box. Luckily I had a number of appropriate chargers that work well with the reader. Compared to the more expensive models, the Paperwhite had the functionality that I was looking for at a reasonable price.
i love it it works perfect for my kids. i am getting another for myself
Great tablet - good for kids and the whole family!
Love the size and screen. Wish there was a chrome app for Kindle, but great for casual surfing. Great for ebooks.
For the price is great up to the minute on everything
Very good to see on nite. I love it thanks Pedro on Best Buy if south beach for take ur time to explain me. Thanks Best Buy
I love this streamer. The fact that all the apps I use are on this machine and the service from Amazon is amazing, it's very worth the money. Alexa is easy to use also. A recommended buy.
Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.
This tablet is just the right size.. my baby was ale to use it on plane. But i would recommend a bumper if you buy for kids.
What else can I say? This is an awesome little device and is leading me towards cutting out cable altogether.
Was able to turn it on and log into the internet seamlessly. Very impressed with the speed and apps available. Great for the price! Buying another today!
it wasn't worth my money to be honest but it is good whenever your bored
My wife purchased this for my daughter , great for learning to read.
Picked this up for my wife, Wanted a spare tablet for watching some random shows and do some book rentals/reading from Amazon. $49.99 is a price that can't be beat, wish i would of picked it up on Black Friday as it was only $34.99.The Tablet has a single speaker, its loud enough for sitting in bed or in a room, also has a 3.5mm standard headphone jack to plug in headphones, or use Bluetooth.Screen resolution is very good for a budget 7" screen. Nothing high def (HD) but for the screen size it is very good. If you come from a higher end Android or iPad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the Tablet Echelon, its entry level for both Amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets....its a $50 tablet that runs almost everything.Fire OS is very similar to Android OS, extremely simple and easy to use. You CAN make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the Fire Tab to another person without having access to your information. Perfect for sharing.Battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use (email and web surfing with brightness on 100%)8GB internal memory isn't enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32GB micro SD card to expand the storage.It does come with unlimited Amazon Cloud storage for photos and music. Camera on the Fire Tab is good for well lit areas, no flash on the camera, but you can snap away photos and auto upload/backup to your amazon cloud drive. Also comes with a trial of Amazon PRIME.Would definitely buy again.
He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs
So easy to read & defines words you are not familiar with.
Still learning how to get the most out of my new Echo but so far it is fun and very useful and informative.
It does everything that much more expensive products do, but it is much, much slower when changing apps. Once using the app, the very slow speed is no longer an issue.
Alexa is like a member of the family. My family uses her daily
Never realized how useful the Echo is until you start using it. Setting alarms, timers, weather, traffic, music, you name it!
It was bought for my husband and he has truly enjoyed it.
Good tablet for the price, it's gonna be a good present.
I would recommend this product. It is very user friendly, It is useful for the entire family. I am not familiar with other products like the google home but I would like to bet this is way better.
I bought my daughter the kindle fire so i purchased the kindle 8 for me
This a a great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate!
Really nice tablet/kindle for the price. It's good for travel and packs small. It's nice to have a "tv", "book", and the internet all in one.
i love this its is very good to have its different
I bought this tablet because it was on sale and i had heard it was a good entry level tablet. It is quick on the touch response. Camera is decent but not the best. Its good to view videos.
My son liked it its a great tablet for kids. I recommend it
Great price .. great tablets for kids .. recommend the tablet
Excellent e-reader. Works well day or night. New built in web browser works.
I have an echo, tap and a dot. Currently my tap serves as a Bluetooth speaker for my dot - making it more like the echo, but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere. It has really good sound much like my echo. It also works great in the app and syncs with all my other products.
I love its portability! The speakers are phenomenal!
Great for my four year old. She is able to access all her learning games with ease.
This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.
This product is a perfect learning tool for my daughter
I got this cheap tablet as a gift for a kid. They can play games, watch videos, and surf the web at a very reasonable price. The performance is pretty good for only a $50 tablet.
Its a tablet under 50$ that performs well and is reliable. A must have.
The Kindle's keep getting better and better. I purchased this for my son who is an avid reader. He loves it and I love that he is reading more.
We weren't sure if we needed this, but when it was on sale and we had a $10 reward cert, why not? It looks really sleek. We enjoy having it in the kitchen. We play trivia daily. Other games like "who wants to be a millionaire " are also fun. We use pandora daily. Good quality speaker despite our large room. We need to learn how to use it to its full capacity but so far so good!
I have had my Kindle Paperwhite for over a month now and I absolutely love it. The screen adjustment to match the room lighting is great and it is much faster and responsive than the older Kindle my wife has. It is so lightweight and comfortable to hold. One of the best parts is the battery last for weeks even with heavy use.
My son absolutely loved the 7" tablet. Wasn't too big or small. Perfect!
This Echo takes the place of the small model. Has great sound very pleased with purchase.
great reader, no glare. Love my iPad, but this is great if you don't want the glare from light. After using this product it is not as quick as an iPad.
I use for weather, traffic, ordering on Amazon, music, Audible books on tape. Now audible for dogs!
The Paperwhite was what I expected. It's easy to set up an account, and I can use it outdoors in the sun. Sadly, downloading library books is not as user friendly as I had hoped, but Amazon is in the business of selling books, not lending them.
Unbelievable how smooth it is. Great product.. soon would be must have for all.
Great for my girls. These tablets are great for smart 7 and 8 year old children.
great for the whole family, there is something for everyone, all ages!
Brought my old tablet in to my local store, and when they said that I would need to replace iit, they suggested this tablet. I love this tablet as much as my firsdt one! Easy to set up and use, plus the price was reasonable. :)
Got this as a replacement for an iPad 9.7 pro. Much more flexible as to third party add ons . And after having both prefer the size of the Fire hd10.1
Oh my, I can't say enough for things about this device. I've been a loyal firestick user for one a year now, I've switched to the box back in may and it was well worth the extra 50 bucks. 80 times faster, live TV works incredibly.
Great for playing games good size screen and fast love it
Hoping for an updated hdx kindle, but settled for this. Enjoy the expanded sd slot.
It was a hit during our Christmas white elephant party! (:
This kindle is by far the best, really enjoy the weight of it and ease on the eyes while reading
One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.
Bought this Kindle Fire tablet for my 8yr old and she loves it.
I purchased this because I was looking for a device that could stream lots of content on a TV in the garage and let me tell you, this was money well spent, lots of great apps, plenty of streaming services, perfect for anyone looking for something inexpensive but still get a lot of features!
Very easy to use and does everything I need it to do. I use it to read emails and watch Netflix
This device works great for streaming TV. I use it with PlayStation Vue, just download the app and you are ready to go. Easy to use and Alexa helps out.
It works great I love it. It plays music and answers all of your questions
I love having more books with less weight! I also love the way I can read at night!
Decent, but have to reset monthly, i have to unplug and at times re enter my pass cause this freezes or stops completely. You can add KODI though. i would still but one for living rm though.
Gave this as a gift to my husband. He likes it very much, but wishes it came with a separate manual of written instructions for using the different functions. He's not a fan of searching for instructions on a device he's not familiar with in the first place. That's frustrating.
Amazon - Echo is a great device to use at home, it helps my kids in their home-work. I am enjoying it, some day I am planning to do some automation of light with that.
We are still not using to the maximum ability. But my wife loves it
new tv is great.wife enjoying books on kindle..!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
This tablet is a great price. Perfect for those who use Amazon and want to use Amazon apps. Does exactly what it should and is easy to use.Decent size for surfing the web. Has a good screen, easy to read text.Nice to be able to surf the web, read a book or listen to music.
This is my second Kindle device. I enjoy using this to read in lower light conditions with the automatic adjustment. Touch screen is nice, but can accidentally move pagesif your fingers slip. No issues with readability in many light conditions.
We love this and take it everywhere with us for streaming stuff
I love my Alexa! Much simpler to set up than I expected, she was connected to my WiFi in under 3 minutes. She's yet failed to understand my request. Our next step is to get Ethernet-controlled outlets for lights, etc., so that Alexa can control those for us.
The backlight is the best part of this Kindle! I highly recommend doing the paperwhite!
This is a great value. Comfortable size for reading.
This is a great learning tool for our 3 year old she loves it!
I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the "walled garden" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point.
Great price for a good product. So far so good and no issues. Wish they had more apps, but great nonetheless. Great for gifts for family members.
Now that this supports hands free access and amazon has discontinued it this is the last chance to get a battery operated echo device.
I wanted to get my daughter one of these for Christmas, and I saw the price and could not pass it up.
This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
Very slow ...I guess it's worth the 40 bucks.. great product for a child..
This has become a great option for me to read anywhere. The best part is I have the Kindle app on my phone and it keeps track on the pages between the two devices. I'm very happy with this purchase!
I bought this for my daughters Birthday she loves itNow her father has gone out and bought one
Great product to start home automation. A bit kludgy for some due to enunciation which frustrates some. For most people it is good and with patience it will learn, but you need to be patient.
I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance
i was not expecting how great this product is. It was really easy to use and install.
This kindle fire is great for the price. I love that you can add more storage for even more apps and pictures.
Hands down this is the best ereader that you can buy...
I use this tablet often. It is the perfect size. The battery last a long time. The quality is great for the price
Bought it for my wife for her birthday. She used on a trip to Europe and loved it.
Combining this with Amazon prime made this an excellent choice for my 1st grader. They have so many free books and learning games.
I didn't find it useful for my 4yr old daugter so i returned it the other day.All the games in it r so kiddy games.
I love the tablet so does my 2 year old she watches her shoes all day long on it its very user friendly
We love being able to watch Netflix using this. We used the ps3 before and that was a hassle. We use the fire tv downstairs where we don't have cable. Some apps cost money, but there are some that you can watch free.
Great little tablet once you get the hang of it. I bought this for my wife and she uses it daily without any issues.
I originally was buying one Kindle Fire for my grandson, but after reviewing specifications I decided to buy 2. I am so happy I did!
They learned how to use it very quickly! Great for travelling in the car...reduces boredom!
A must for someone who loves to read. Great to carry arounnd!
My son is 4 and he loves it. Super easy to use for kids.
Gift for my mom, easy to use with her limited technology skills. Answers are limited. Could not identify closest showing of a movie to our house for an example.
Good sounding speaker, using your voice becomes more natural as you use it. If you have prime the included music is a great deal.
Best way to cut the cord. Saved me over 150 dollars a month!!
Wanted a tablet that would fit in my purse. Very easy to use. Would buy again.
Love this tablet. I purchased one for my elderly mother and she is able to use it. Real easy set up and has many apps already ready to go when you turn it on.
Thank you for the gifts and thank you for the great customer service.
My grand daughter has her educational apps on her tablet and enjoys them tremendously!
I absolutely love it. Cut my cable bill in half. So many movies and stations I would never have dreamed of trying
I wanted a device where we could enjoy in the house as a family and that was simple enough for my wife to feel comfortable with. This exceeded my expectations and is so nice to tell Alexa to play a certain song or playlist. Great sound also!
I returned as I want to see the new one with screen and the new apple one before I make a final decision. It was everything promised and expected.
Great to have my entire library with me and no I can read in bed with the backlight also.
It works just right. My husband loves it too. It does well with my kids.
Does what it's supposed to do. On the spot hands free entertainment system.
This product's reaction time between apps is what sold me. No lag like other devices. 4k streaming looks awesome!!
Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.
Always learning new stuff. This tech toy is very useful.
Bought an IPad and didn't like it. Returned it and got the Fire 10.1. This is my third Fire, love it....no.learning curve.
this product works most of the time. there are frequent issues with reception
Love everything about it. No complaints, Will recommend it to a friend.
Alexa is my best friend. She helps with shopping lists, keeps my calendar current and is always there to set a timer. She helps me change channels, plays my music. I really cannot live without her.
Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
I bought this as a birthday gift for my dad and he LOVES it! I highly recommend this!
Sons tablet stopped working so needed a replacement this tablet fits the bill .
like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product
Nice product. Reading made easy. Bought it for a friend.
Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it.
This is my second tablet that I have purchased. This one was a gift for other son. He loves it & I recommended it to numerous friends.
Although expensive....is exactly what you would expect.
Great tablet for kids, very affordable. Great introductory tablet for first time tablet users
An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read "paper" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.
I love Alexa, she is fun to use and easy to use. She still needs to learn more though.
Nice, fast, easy i bought for my mom and she is very happy.!!!
Very affordable and very easy to set up. It has great features. Makes you use your phone lesser.
The Amazon-Fire is an inexpensive WiFi device we use for answering messages and is quickly shifted from person to person as well as moved from room to room.
I've been a kindle app user for years. I am happy that I finally got the kindle paperwhite. Love it! Thanks Best Buy for price matching.
We both really enjoy our Echo. There was no problem setting it up. I literally just plugged it in and haven't touched it since. Besides enjoying the music we really like the "Shopping List.". The weather function is great also. As far as it's sound, it has a little too much bass for me. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars
This tablet works as well or better than my iPad. It is quicker and simpler to use with better speed and reaction.
Love my ECHO . Listening to my favorite station is great . It has a great sound.
Great functionality and quality for the price. I've bought several of these for customer giveaways and have yet to hear a complaint!
This was a gift for my grandfather's 80th birthday. He was amazed that Alexa could play his favorite songs.
Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.
This tablet is very ideal for kids...it comes with a great case that protects it well.
Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price
This is really easy to use. It understands many voices and does what you ask.
It makes life simpler if I want to play some music all I have to do is tell Alexa and the music play's, if I want to know the weather, make a shopping list Alexa helps you out . The amazon echo is pretty handy.
This tablet was plugged in all night and did not charge.No powerWhite elephant
My mother in law was so happy to get this tablet. She cried when she opened our gift at Christmas. It is easy to use and easy to navigate. She is a first time tablet user at almost 70 years old.. And has never used a smartphone either..she now spends most of her time on it. Great tablet for the price. Definitely recommend
This is a well made tablet that has many great features.
best bang for the buck out there,works fast, easy on the wallet, just an all around easy to understand and operate product.
Bought for my kid - 5 year old Kid. Worth a buy. Recommended.
I really enjoy the fire tablet I also have a iPad but the $50 you can't go wrong I bought 1 for each of my kids so they leave my iPads alone lol
We all love his thing. Had the google home and returned it out of frustration and in favor of the echo. Eye happy
my grandkids love it. This is the 3 one we bought.
I love this thing , I recommend it for everyone a must have
My mom lives her tablet! She is obsessed with it!!
Great simple to use light weight and love that's its wireless
Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK
If you have Amazon Prime I would Recommend. . It is equally build and quality is good. Interface is nice and easy. Games not so good.
Just what I needed. Works great inside or outside. Must have a cover to protect the screen.
Alexa does a great job playing music and adding items to my shopping list. I have not used very many of the skills but I think this item has great potential to continue to improve.
Force update when turned it on for the first time. Have to wait for an hour with nothing to do on the tablet. Really bad user experience.
Absolutely love my Echo, from helping with our shopping list, listening to music, checking the daily weather and news, to just telling the occasional joke. You will find yourself talking to Alexa every day! It's a life changer!
I would recommend this excellent Amazon - Fire 7 Tablet product
Works great with sling tv to fill the gap in shows I watch
Great little tablet . Kids love it !! Does everything that I expected it to do!!
Sounds great. Picks up voice very well and responds quickly.
Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.
I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
Simple to use, best for kids cheap gift for distant relatives and first time users
Christmas gift for my 4yr old grandson, he loves it. Easy for him to play by himself
I enjoy the my Amazon Echo so much I purchased a Dot for my bathroom.
Great tablet to teach young children . Grandchildren love it to watch favorite you tube shows
It works well for what I needed. I purchased for great price on black Friday.
Got this on Black Friday and wasn't I would use it much but I do, excellent value, easy to use.
Love my amazon fire! Easy to hook up and use. Even better if you are an Amazon Prime member. Music, movies, Netflix, Hulu & many more.
We have a Roku device and was wanting another device for another room and after reading the reviews we decided on the Amazon Fire TV. It has taken a bit to get used to the layout since we'd been using the Roku for over 5 years. But overall we're happy with the purchase and would recommend the Amazon Fire TV.
Love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book.
This tablet was purchased for my niece. It is at a great price point to do what we need...movies and games!
As good if not better than many other more expensive tablets
Given as gifts. Those who received are very pleased with size and function of tablet, especially the tablets with color cases. Have bought several and satisfied.
Small, portable works as a blue tooth speaker when I take it away from home with me.
More memory and better resolution than prior iterations. Much better for reading books versus a conventional tablet due to fewer distractions. Easier on the eyes.
This product works great for the that we bought it for.
Alexa is pretty fun. I feel as though with updates and more" skills" to come in the future she will be even more helpful. As an actual speaker or sound system it's just ok. You don't really get the deep rich tones that you would with a larger higher quality system, but for like $80 Echo and Alexa is a good deal.
I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky. I may have to switch it out.
I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.
Super easy to set up and absolutely worth the money.
This product cuts our cable bill in half! Quality is great. You can literally watch anything old or new!
Works great. So easy to use. Can just ask and I get the answers.
Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze.
Echo technology becomes addictive. The more you use it, the smarter Alexa becomes, learns more about your likes, music etc.I was apprehensive for nothing.
Amazon Fire TV is a great addition to our household. It offers tons of programs and I love getting my amazon prime movies this way. Easy to install, easy to navigate the menu, and an overall A+ in my book.
A nice hands-free versatile piece of technology to have in the house.
I love Alessa, I love to play music all day long..
this tablet is the best buy i could buy . i paided $33.00 dollars for a brand new kindle fire !!!! Awesome!!!!
Purchased this is a replacement for a television during a move. So far, I haven't been missing the programs. Kindle makes reading easy, accessible and fun. I take it with me everywhere I go during the day (I live in a busy metro area) and it fits neatly into my backpack. Great for bike commuters or train riders. Accessible, cheap entertainment with a fantastic build quality.**Side note: I originally bought a basic Kindle, and traded up for this. Very glad I did! It is much better than the original, and the 300 dpi plus back light makes a huge difference.
If your have the white plug it'll work
I love it so much! Easy to navigate, perfect size screen! Very happy!!!
Easy to use and put kpdi on it now I can watch movies whenever
I had the original kindle which I loved but it was a pain to always have to have it lit when reading without proper light. It is great to have the screen backlit without the eyestrain that comes with a tablet.
Had several fire sticks and thought let's try this. Got it in sale, it just so fast. Would recommend for sure!
We use this device daily. It is so easy to use and the sound is incredible. We can hear itt clearly throughout 1800 sq foot home
There are a lot of questions that were not answered. I just like the fact that I don't have to get up and turn off the lights.
Seems like a great tablet for my youngest daughter. The parental controls are nice and the battery life seems decent too.
I installed the echo and linked it to my ecobee thermostat and Hue lights. It took a little time but wasn't too difficult really. I have it linked to pandora for music and my favorite news station for my morning news flash. The speaker isn't the greatest for a true audiophile but it's adequate. Good product overall.
This is an awesome device. It does everything advertised and then more! Weekly updates on new features are great to receive. No complaints.
I wouls recommend this over your phone or pc display anyday of the week. Great for your eyes. Doesnt weight anything. Finished reading the gunslinger on this.
Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you.
Purchased this for my son. Has room to upgrade memory to allow more books & games. But the speakers could be better or located in a better position.
very easy to use and the battery life is execellent
I have had two previous kindles since they where first available. I really like all the new upgrades. The screen is very crisp and clean. The color is great. Much easier to look for books.
Love the box and the stick both. They are easy to use as well.
This is a nice handy tablet. Performance is good for the money paid. Will recommend if you are not downloading too any things.
Until I buy all the lights and linked products this is just a radio with limited stations.
Had no problem with the instructions available in the system itself. Enjoy the 'easy on the eyes' lighting.
Decent product for the price compared to others in the same price range
I cancelled my cable and only use the Amazon Fire .. I can watch my programmes when I feel like and it's easy to use !
I have purchased several fire sticks through out my house, this one thus far as been the best. Loving the voice search it's like having siri on your tv.
My daughter loves it we like that it has a worry free gaurantee and parental controls it was
I'm a big fan of my Amazon Fire Tv. I really enjoy being to access my favor apps on one device.
Our daughter and her friend purchased the Echo and I loved it.... my husband bought me one for my birthday and I love it....
I bought 3 more of these for family and they love them.
We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
Works amazingly! Very fast, high quality. I've already recommended to many family and friends.
Bought think would not use much lets try it out. We have used it everyday
I purchased this product for my ten year old daughter. She absolutely loves it! It was easy to use, simple to navigate, and even easier to set-up (especially all of the parental controls and such). I am able to manage her account online and limit her use and time on the tablet, as well as keep track of any purchases she may wish to make. It is a great starter tablet for a responsible youth.
it's got a few glitches in the system but overall, it's so great not having to deal with any cable company. I've got everything I need all in this neat little package.
My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
This Amazon Fire tablet is an excellent barebones tablet that is great for checking email and surfing ineternet keeping tabs on facebook and twitter! At 50 bucks ya can't go wrong!
I bought this main to give me control of my Echo in the bedroom. Works flawlessly. Love being able to turn off all lights in the house with a simple voice command before bed. "Alexa, All lights off"
The echo has great sound, and awesome microphones, but does not play music from youtube or find music easily even with amazon music unlimited. Bluetooth is a plus.
Time to disconnect from Cable TV and save $150 monthly. Can get almost every channel I need with out the cable TV expense. Takes some getting used to and planning but all in all a good choice.
Good buy for the price. Easy to surf the web a lot of apps in the App Store
I bought this for a friend. I have the 2013 version and I love it. Great gift for avid readers and those just looking for something light to hold. The Backlighting makes it wonderful for reading in the middle of the night. :)
I absolutely love my Kindle...especially this newer generation! Great product!
Happy The Fire TV, Have had no issues, Like another way to use Alexa.
It does everything any other tablet will do. You can't beat the price. The only bad thing is the camera it's as sharp and clear. The pictures come out kinda of dull. But other that great little tablet make sure you get more memory.
Due to intl travel restrictions, I didn't want to risk my laptop. This inexpensive tablet fit the bill. I was able to upload ppts and other work on this device and was able to link up with an LCD projector for my overseas work. The built-in ads were a miniscule distraction given the quality of the device and the cost.
Fun gift for adult children and their families. Bought three total for Christmas gifts
I extremely enjoy and like my Kindle Voyage Reader a whole bunch! I like reading on it a whole bunch, especially my Living Bible, because I'm a Christian that loves God and Jesus Christ of Nazareth! I believe this product is a very excellent reader, which a person can read all of their books on the Kindle Voyages in their Amazon library! Definitely get one today, because especially, because it is light weight and has an awesome back light for reading in the dark. I like it because it is so light and easy on the arms while holding while reading. God bless you! :)
Kindle fire is one the tablet that those everything you need to do
Much better than the first generation Amazon Fire TV. Very fast and reliable.
When Amazon first released this, I couldn't rationalize spending the money to purchase something that could play music, answer questions, report traffic and weather, etc. I did a lot of research before looking into purchasing one because I wanted to start converting my home into a Smart Home. I purchased this along with the Philips Hue and so far, I haven't regretted the purchase. Using the Apps to control the lighting is great but when you can simply use voice commands, it makes it that much more convenient. I would recommend this or any of the other "echo" products if you're looking to convert to a Smart Home.
Great product. Works perfectly. I would buy it again.
It is a great "book" to carry around. I really love it.
I love this kindle works great for me I will be ordering another one today for my wife.
So much fun. I continue receiving updates. I do have to continue reading new things to do with it.
This is my favorite piece of technology in my home right now. I love how it connects to my phone, plays music,look up locations, track my workout and find recipes. Plus, it constantly updates.
Great shows, fabulous quality, highly recommended, good price.
Fits nicely in my hand. My third Kindle. Granddaughter likes it too.
Absolutely love it! No problems with it at all and great battery.
I bought this one for my wife. She loves it. I highly recommend this Kindle reader.
Works great plus look at YouTube video's to see other features available.
It is a nice tablet to have, however I do not like the setup for making a kid profile and not being able to download to their profile. Also do not like amazon's charge for a kid profile.
This streaming content box packs a lot of punch for it's size. Very responsive to your commands whether using handheld remote or voice activation. Very easy to set up, register, and use.Some of the content is a little misleading as you need to look for the prime banner otherwise you have to purchase to watch which was a surprise for me as when I saw all the selections, I was excited about all the offerings. Some of the movies I wanted to see, weren't even available. But there is still plenty of other stuff to watch. I'll give it a year trial to see if its really worthwhile, but seems ok so far when you bring music content and free 2 day shipping into the package.
fire TV works much better than Fire stick. The connection is more stable, the only problem is that the box seeems to go to sleep and does not recognise the remote. it starts working in a few seconds. it is just annoying
Bought this for a grandchild. Perfect gift. Recommend this.
Overall the Amazon Fire is easy to use. I would recommend this device. Also, Best Buy has the best warranty policy!
Works great, easy to use, picture is great too. Not missing my cable bill at all.
I bought this as a gift for my sister in law on thanks giving and this is the best gift...They just love it to the best
Very pleased with Fire TV. It works as described. Excellent item
I love reading so this e-reader works really well for me. I just wish it was a little bigger. I was used to another e-reader that had a larger screen. Otherwise, it works!
Alexa is great to have around! Especially if you have Amazon Prime... literally the music will go ALL day until you ask her to stop! Best Buy had an incredible price on her. The echo does a variety of things besides play music. If you are into gadgets, this will not disappoint you!
I had the fire stick before buying this and though I liked the fire stick i thought it could be faster. The fire tv definitely bumps up the performance a bit and having the voice search really helps a lot and makes it better.
As a regular Amazon Prime user that gets much of my staples through prime, Echo makes it that much easier.
i can read anytime and anywhere.....................
The portability is nice but misses key elements from the other two.Sound is good but this unit does not allow for the new peak in feature or allow you to add this speaker to play music all thru the house .
I bought for the wife, she's still using her old one. don't know why
Main purpose, take home automation to next level, voice control. Purchase of Echo was to ingrate LIFX and Samsung Smart Hub by using voice. While this is not flawless, it works pretty good! It is on the bleeding edge so some challenges are to be expected. The apps for Echo appear to be growing, I just hope development continues. Next on list would be the harmony controller so that I can start to ingrate TV and Audio controls using Echo! At this time Sonos appears to be a challenge and a personal server appears to be the only option. Would recommend purchase! Help to keep the community growing! Make recommendations and comments on the apps you use!
Very smart device we enjoy to have it in our livinroom
The kiddos love this tablet! I bought a different brand last year and it lasted less than 2 months. This is still going strong at 5+ months.
Fun. It does everything as advertised. Favorite purchase in a long time! Still discovering more and more things that the Echo is capable of, but I totally love this!
It performs just as advertised, and I keep finding new tasks for her. If you love gadgets like I do this is a must have.
Purchased this tablet for my 8yr old son, he loves it.
I was not happy when my original Kindle paperwhite failed after the warrantee period expired but I loved the battery life and readability in almost all environments.
Very easy to use and Alexa is awesome! App store has anything you could want in it too.
We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!
I purchased this tablet fire 7 for my daughter and she really loved it.
I truly enjoy this product. I have an older one but this is superb in all areas of entertainment.
I am surprised that they could sell this tablet for so low considering it's quality. It's not the best tablet by a long shot but I haven't had many complaints for the price. The apps and OS run very well; not sluggish like one may think. The screen and sound quality isn't super HD but it's acceptable.
I bought 2 of these Amazon - Fire - 7" Tablet - 8GB - tablets.One for an elderly friend in her late 60's and she does great with it.Also bought one for my 11 year old granddaughter. Easy to use and quick response to downloads and window changes. I have been recommending it to lots of people who are short on cash but need a really good tablet.
Amazing resolution is a great diference with the firestick
I've had for 1yr and works great. No complaints. Battery life is good.
Purchased the Kindle fire fir my grandfaughter and she loved it. It was so easy for her to use. The size was perfect http://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooking-times/
I bought this tablet on Black Friday. The price was excellent, and it is easy to use. I would highly recommend as a daily web browser, and especially as a reader.
The echo allows everyone in my house to add to my shopping list... love it.
This is a great virtual assistant, learning new skills everyday. Works perfectly with my Nest thermostat.
this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...
The Amazon fire works great! It's easy to setup, the picture quality is excellent, and the Alexis talk bottom makes searching for stuff easy. We just got rid of our cable, but kept the internet and we've saved over $70 on our bill. Streaming shows on the device is simple, but sometimes the movie or show would get stuck on fast forward. When it does that you have to stop the show then wait two seconds then resume. Other then that little issue, the Fire tv is a great device.
Decent and simple tablet that gets the job done.Excellent!
My daughter loves this. Having access to her favorite apps and games is great without all the adult content.
I have several Amazon Kindles already. This was a nice, reasonable cost tablet for my little one. I have been quite happy with the Kindle devices.
Great for the kids to have and play games on. They want put it down.
I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loved it.
a friend recommended the amazon fire tablet to me. its easy to use and i am very happy i brought the fire tablet
This tablet is perfect for the kids. Easy to use, dependable, and affordable.
The firestick is great and sasy to use.I tell all my friends how great it is . I have purchase one gor my travels
Don't buy this if u don't read books also very rarely read the book
I absolutely LOVE my new Kindle! I'll never run out of good books to read again! Best Buy had it delivered 3 days before I even expected it to arrive. Couldn't be happier
I bought Alexa for my husband for Fathers Day, since he's always looking up the daily weather forecast. I think I use it as much as he does, I love the music choices and the speakers sound great!
I bought this tab for my daughter's birthday.its got a good screen and sound for the price. I also play for the children's app freetime which is perfect for her.
If you've had a kindle you know it's more like reading a book page. Some will prefer it enough to have this device. My elderly mother uses the version of this that connects to cell towers and is able to download her own books from her subscription service. She had trouble removing them once she hits the download limit. I have this version. If you have wifi, I think this is the best option if you have the money. I don't see much purpose in the upgrade and I don't know who wants a bigger bezel. The touch works fine. My only complaint is there is no speaker and at this price it should. I had to buy an adapter to have books read to me. The text to speech is very good and realistic.
Awesome deal awesome price and nowadays who needs a pc when u can get a tab
Over all my kids love their tablets. I would've given 5 but the fact that it doesn't have a lock to the app store I took off 1
My grandson really enjoys the tablet it works well ,I love would definitely recommend it .
The product was in good condition and my child enjoyed it
Best small tablet on the market hands down. Easy bright great touch screen.
I can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. I am satisfied with the performance.
Had been looking to replace an RCA tablet from a couple years ago for the kids, one that wouldnt break the bank but still was powerful enough for the games the kids would use it for. Sleek, lightweight, powerful, love that it has 2 cameras.
Very easy to use. The sound is incredible for such a smallfootprint.
Great for the price.. Good for gifting, if you don't want to spend too much :)
It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.
Alexis doesn't always respond, could not connect to WIFI when I took it to Vegas
Amazon Fire is easy to setup and easy to use. The user interface is friendly.
Got this kindle as a Christmas present for my mother and she absolutely loved it. She enjoys reading at night but hates how dim the lights are when she reads a book. This was a perfect compromise!
Bought for my granddaughter age 5 for Xmas. She loves it.
I give this product an excellent review. I would highly recommend it.
This is an excellent choice for an e-reader. I purchased it specifically for a vacation in the sun. It did a great job, was easy to use and overall allowed me to easily read out in the bright sun. the backlit display at night was very nice and makes reading a breeze anytime without problem. I have an older nook book that is color. I chose the amazon version so that I could subscribe to the unlimited monthly reading program. in comparison between the 2 brands I do like the nook better for easy of moving between pages - I haven't figured that out quite yet on the kindle, but I'm sure it's quite easy. there's also no person that I can quickly drop into the store to ask a question on how to do something. if you are a person who likes being shown how to use a device. I know my mom who is 80 might have a little problem with some getting the screen at the top to pull down but 95% of the people most likely won't. Best thing I like and am glad I invested was the backlight.
My 3 year old got it for his birthday and he loves it!
Does exactly what it is needed for my daughter and comes at a great price.
Needed to replace my original Kindle with a keyboard. Was leary about new model as very pleased with original. This is improvement as same size screen, but smaller in overall size and easier to scroll through pages.
I bought this hoping to make good use of my 4K TV but realized that there is very little 4K content out there. But at least I'll be ready then.
Great d e vice for reading. I would still recommend a Samsung tablet.
Don't know why I waited so long to "CUT THE CORD" and with AmazonProducts like these it's definitely a "NO BRAINER".
Simple set up. Range of activities make for something new each interaction.
My 10 year old granddaughter loves to read. She can now download books from the local library as wall as other websites. This is a wonderful tool for a child that loves to read
Enjoying navigating Alexa, will have to add devices to get more things to enjoy- turn on lights, etc
I love this Amazon fire thing so much, I said bye bye to direct tv.. This will also save me over $100 a month. That's just icing on the cake for me!!!!!!!
I purchased one as a Christmas gift. from Best Buy on line...it worked fine the first month,did not use it for a few weeks. I went to turn it on..did not get nothing .The lefthand bottom corner says "FASTBOOTH mode" It is locked on this and I get nothing else.Did not buy any product protection so I guess it is a complete loss.
We have been looking into buying it for kids for some time and they love it
Bought this for my teenage daughter and it works beautifully with great battery life.
The apps for the kids are slow and don't all show up on their home page, But other than that, it's great for the price and to entertain my 2 children.
The Amazon Tap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. We particularly like that we can move it from room to room without AC attached & the battery lasts a long time. We even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Prime and Spotify. We recommend it highly.
No reason to shop around at this price there is something for everybody I bought 3 at black friday price for gifts no complants!
Bought this tablet foe my 8 years old son and he love it.
Got this tablet for my 10 year old son. It works great as a basic tablet. It was parental controls. He likes to watch moves on it in the car. Easy to use!
If you like to read books, I totally recommend this product. I love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps. I used to read books on the iPad all the time but it would strain my eyes. After reading all the reviews I decided it was finally time to get a ereader. Since I had my iPad already I just needed one to strictly read books, so I got the paperwhite. It is so nice to read from especially in the sun. It's almost like reading from the actual book. It's the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books, even some for my child. It's also great for traveling. I have all my books on hand no matter where I go.  There are only two cons to the paperwhite. One is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an iPad. At times it doesn't register my swipes or taps. The other con is that it's only black and white. It really isn't a problem when I'm reading, just for the children's books.
I bought this for my wife who really likes the Amazon Tablets. She said she really enjoyed the very clear picture and how fast it was. Like they say.... "Happy Wife....Happy Life"
Bought this tablet for my daughter. It was very hard to figure out how to switch to the kids profile. She used it for maybe a day and when we went to charge it the cable just fell out and wouldn't actually charge.
Ran well. Couldn't download very many apps until space ran out. We didn't like that you couldn't use Google play either
This is an amazing item for the money. Cheaper then my first scientific calculator many years ago.
This is a must buy for anyone. It's sturdy and its a amazon for only fifty dollars. But the camera is not good for photography but its worth fifty dollars overall.
Amazon fire tv has faster processor and more memory than firestick which makes the guide and navigation much faster, have sling tv app installed and scrolling through menus etc is really fast. Would recommend this to other people considering amazon firestick to choose this instead.
I started to buy the Voyage but when I saw how close the price was to the Oasis, I decided to go ahead and buy the Oasis. So glad I did! I love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. It is so lightweight and I love the option of the screen rotating whenI need to change hands. Awesome device!
I would have given 5 stars but my unit refuses to wake up when I hit button on remote. I have to pull the plug to power unit up. Hopefully Amazon will resolve this issue.
Our Echo is fun. The only problem is that Alexa seems to turn herself off and won't respond. Otherwise, love the music.
I got this fire TV because my fire TV stick didn't get good wifi reception in my bedroom. It has wired networking, so it works great! It's snappier than the fire TV.stick and does the same stuff.
I purchased this tablet and have been pleasantly surprised how simple it is to use. Very user friendly and have not one complaint!
Very happy with purchase. Would recommend to family and friends.
I bought the amazon echo for a Christmas present and they loved it.
This product is very light and convenient. i often use it in the evening.
It works fine and is easy to use. I would recommend it.
A friend recommended the tablet and I am happy with it.
We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
Works great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this was one of the best product i could have bought for my daughter
Picture quality is not good. I don't like this product
I gave this as a christmas present, and they liked it.
Replacing my original white page Kindle. I love these readers! Like the new auto adjust backlight! Also like the new page turner slides on the sides of the screen. Great product!
Love this item works great and is so useful in the home
Bought this to replace a broken tablet hoping it would work for a replacement. Unless you are amazon everything. Google apps aren't easily installed on this tablet. Otherwise it's a great value for the money.
The Fire is a perfect tablet and reader. you can't beat the price.
so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though.
You will not regret this purchase! The kindle holds a charge for more than a week, is super light weight, easy on the eyes, and allows you to define words with the point of a finger! It even adds defined words to a vocabulary list, so you can review them! ♡♡♡♡♡
This is so easy to read no matter where you are...beach, train or airplane!
Got my amazon fire table and love it. It's really easy to use .battery last long
I have tried all of the Fire TV and I have to say this one is the best especially if you have a 4K TV. I bought this to go with my 4K TV and I have to say it doe snot disappoint. There is a lot of 4K HDR content out there and this is a good place to get a lot of it. I highly recommend getting this version if you are on the lookout for the best.
We bought my brother-in-law the dot and decided on the full size for ourselves. It's been fun and stil haven't explored all the capabilities.
Before you spend a lot if money on a high end tablet for your kids, try this one. Great value!
The Eco Alexa is an amazing piece of technology. Design is sleek and unnoticeable.
Amazon fire is cheap and best for reading and playing games. I bought this to gift someone and it was liked very much
Great tablet for the price. Got it for my daughter. She loves it.
Easy to use, size is just right. Easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse.
It's been very helpful around the house and I now plan on buying dots to place in certain sections of my house.
I bought it to replace my fire stick and to get surround sound, but it didn't do that, but still decided to keep it
This is a great little tablet! Me and my brother in law bought one originally for his dad because his laptop was getting a little old and the main thing he does on it is watch Youtube videos. It performs fine for what he does it for. It was such a steal my brother in law got one himself because he wanted to play games on it and again, works perfectly! Great buy for the price
Lot's of entertainment content game apps movie tv shows parental control let's you manage child access
Everyone should have one because it has so many great features. Listen to music, control home security, find out what the weather is and all by just asking.
I bought four of these for my children to replace the RCA tablets that no longer worked. They load much faster and the battery last longer on a single charge. The are very durable and worth the money!
Echo is easy to setup and use. Manage grocery lists, play favorite music, purchase items right off Amazon!
I have read books on my phone and IPad and Kindle.....but rarely would read long due to disraction of other apps and email.....or couldn't read outside because of glare.....well this product has solved all my problems.....no distractions....just read and read for hours now....and can comfortably read outside or on the back end of our motorcylce if I want becasue NO GLARE!!!!! Love it :)
I bought it for my mom and she loves it. Great picture and great battery life.
This is a good tablet for someone who wants a starter. Nice screen, easy to use. Great graphics.
Amazing deal. Good product. I am satisfied........
Great tablet for kids. Also great for travel as you can expand the memory allowing you to store music, games, movies, etc. battery life is decent but doesn't charge back up very fast so that is one downside.
I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books.
Was not sure of which was better, but went with the Echo. We are quite pleased and use it all the time. Still learning all the ins and outs, but it is very good.
I bought his for my eight year old and he loves it. Amazon has many apps both for games and educational that he benefits from every day
Bought it as a Christmas gift for dad. For someone who is new to gadgets, he is enjoying it!
Works well! I would highly recommend. Better quality than others I have for phones, etc. so I only use this one now..
I would recommend this tablet for someone who loves Amazon
Works a lot better than my fire stick, no buffering.
great tablet works well was a good gift for a begiiner
The device has friendly operation interface. The resolution is high.The battery also lasts pretty long. It is a good one. I like it.
I love the Amazon Fire 7! It's very easy to use and I love the fact that you can turn the Blue Shade lighting on and off. It's fabulous for reading before bed.
love it. Bought it as gift for my nephew. Very convenient
Bought this for my daughters elderly friend across the street. She loves it.
Alexa works great no problems with it at all. Easy to integrate with
Got Fire tablet as an experiment. It was low cost and very compact but still and edge over my smart phone as far as screen size. Unit has worked flawlessly and has require minimum attention, but does a good job on email and recreational browsing.
I got 4 for our boys 15 , 13, 10 & 5 Love that I can create profiles for them an manage their content
This is a great value works great as a table has a good camera and serves as a good MP3 player. Love that the storage can be expanded.
Great item , can use like a regular computer, facebook ,email , Netflix an so on. Only problem websites that use flashplayer,won't play videos.
the Amazon Fire tablet is great for our daughter, has actually started reading more
Who could could pass up such a deal under $50.Full color H D viewing and easy to use. Read a book or watch TV or a movie. This is an all around fun piece of equipment.
Buy this for my friend Have one at home... good sound,fast response and easy to setup.
There have been a few minor changes included in this new Kindle that I don't particularly like.Opening page is slightly confusing.
Got this on sale for 100! Replaces my 500 cds! Must buy as long as you have Prime!
I brought it for my boys and they love it. Great investment
When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book.
The fire tv system was very easy to set up and use. We love the voice function.
Awesome streaming device, love the alexa feature!!
This was a great present for my husband who is extremely tech savvy and very particular about his choice of equipment. He was overjoyed with this. Glad I choose to stick with Samsung.
Replaced our old kindle. Still the best for reading outdoors
Purchased this for my wife. She likes it. Can't go wrong with it.
Price was right and works like a champ. Bought for my mom and she loves it
It's good for toddlers. Would recommend to another parent.
Delivered a crisp display but had trouble with the keyboard size, using a stylus helped!
I bought this and like it very much also love doing business with best buy I will buy from best buy from now on.
Best reader i think for the price. The only thing amazon needs to work on is the user experience. Make it a little easier to use.
Excellent product at a great price! Perfect for my little boy
This is an absolute life saver for small children.
I enjoy listening to Alexia speak. I wish she could answer more questions.
I've tried the Google Home and the simple "Ok Google" is a syllable too long for ease voice control use. The echo simply has so many compatible devices even separate from my Smartthings hub that it can control. The soubd it delivers is sufficient for standalone use but option to connect to speakers via Bluetooth or AUX is useful. It can hear you much better than the Google Home and the integration with other echo dots in a smart home makes the experience seamless. Setup is a breeze. My only gripe is that commands need to be exact to your setups so you just can't say "turn off all lights" without a trigger made up unlike Google home. Overall, it's a great product for home automation and voice control.
The Amazon Fire TV is an excellent alternative to cable and satellite prison. The amount of content available is staggering. The unit functions flawlessly.
Bought as a Mother's Day Gift. This is great for someone who does not already have a tablet, and is a bit uncomfortable with technology. The tablet guides you pretty well, and once we had it setup with OverDrive, the recipient was very happy. FREE LIBRARY KINDLE BOOKS!
I needed a kindle for my schooling so I decided to look into this and read some reviews. After reading the reviews I decided on this kindle and it is perfect compared to my other tablet.
Great product for listening to Pandora and Amazon music
Gift for my wife. She likes it a lot. very happy with it. Thinks it is better than the Samsung she was using. Great buy for the money.
User friendly even for a non-techie person like my mom.
No issues at all... wish it were water proof. My kids and family love it.
great tablet for the money. I mostly use it for movies. Plan on getting an sd card, storage runs out fast
I bought this for my room but my teenagers wint let me use it. They live. I'm thinking about getting another for myself
This kids fire tablet is perfect for our 5 year old granddaughter. We downloaded some free and purchase kids apps. It give us a break as she's not always asking for our tablet. And we know the content on it is safe.
This is a great tablet for kids. Not expensive and does all that is needed on a high level. The only draw back is the Amazon App store.
We enjoy this new addition to our home. It's fun, entertaining, and the speaker is great.
WAS LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLET. .. GREAT PRICE FOR THIS ONE!
Great tablet! User friendly.....size good, eAsy setup..
Love the Echo great for all kinds of activities. I mostly use mine for the news and turning on the lights.
Absolutely love my Kindle.. it is small enough to fit in a pocketbook or small bad. Love taking it with me to the pool or beach. the paper white make reading so much easier .. Highly recommend
I really didn't expect it to be so convenient. Carrying just the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite instead of multiple books.
Good speaker but limited if you don't have a big music collection. I wish it did more
Works great, allows the use of cat 6 and wireless use.
I really only bought this to read book and to have the kids play or watch whatever the want. It's an amazing tablet for the price!
I bought this item for one of my interns and she loved it.
best price for a starter tablet. very efficient for any age.
I got this for my kids and it is perfect. I got each of them one and now all 4 of them have linked up their games and build cities together.
I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest.
I bought this device recently for my daughter, she likes it very much. She learning new things. I also gifted this device to my friends Son.
I rarely watch live TV so watching my favorite TV programs on the fire TV works better for me. Also great for watching netflix.
This is my first time using a kindle. I love that I can read it in all types of light. the size makes it very portable and it's easy to use.
This baby is a bargain. Very good screen, decent overall quality and performance...and now Alexa. I use it with Bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. Hold the home button and ask Alexa to play easy jazz. No muss; no fuss. Improves upon 'regular' Alexa because she has a screen now!.
Great machine to add additional apps and games to any smart or non-smart TV. A must have for streamers.
instead of spending a lot of money on a iPad for my kid, i bought this great alternative option. price is great! works great too!
fits easily into my purse or bag. small compact!!!
Great product. Nice to just ask for something (weather, music, internet purchases) and get it.
I've only been playing around with it for a few days but already love it. Very simple to use.
This is a very cool item. The voice recognition does not work great when playing music, but still good product
It was not what I went into the store for but it's what I left with
My granddaughter loves this system. It is easy for her to hold, and she loves to play games on it.
It was a great gift to give for some one who can not afford a tablet.
Amazing tablet for the price i love it is really easy to use and light weight awesome speed
Purchased as a gift for grandchildren after comments from friends and reviews about the parental controls. Would not have considered without this feature.
I bought two of these this year and I love my Fire TV it's very fast and fairly cheap the customer service was great when I bought my Fire TV. I can watch my Amazon Prime Hulu Netflix everything from one box. I will be purchasing one more cuz I love them so much specially when you stream using an ethernet cable which the best. This box is really fast it does not buffer
Price/Quilty this thing is a no brainer. Awesome portal into the Amazon world.
Really like this allows me to set reminders and listen to Sirius radio. Easy to set up
Does exactly what it is supposed to do
She initially didn't think she would like it as she preferred reading an actual book. She changed her mind after a couple of days and now really prefers it. Easy to use
I love my Echo. Started with an Echo Dot last year at Christmas and I was hooked. I bought an Echo Tap for my husband for his birthday to be able to take outside on the patio or when working in the garage, and now we have a full-sized Amazon Echo.I am now so used to "talking to the air" that it is weird not to always precede everything with "Alexa"
This Amazon-Fire 7 is on fire meaning that it is a Hot Buy at Best Buy. It does everything I need it to do. Haven't had any problems.
This has been an exceptional hit for us she totally loves it.
This was very easy to order online and pickup. Convenient and hastle free.
The convience of the Amazon Echo is instantly noticable! This is the first step I've taken towards building a "smarter" home and am loving it. Being able to grab information by just talking to this device is wonderful. Granted I do feel a little silly having her tell me jokes whenever I am home alone...but that aside this is a great device. The Echo can sync up with Hue lights, nest thermastats, etc. and I can't wait to try that out! Make sure to get Geek Squad Protection! Yes it is a few more bucks, but why not protect your investment? I'm sure it'll come in handy when I need it too.
we had an older model from 2012 and it broke so we just replaced with newer one. Love the new features.
Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.
this device is awesome, I use it everyday, ask it anything
If you enjoy music do not buy, you cannot send a Bluetooth signal out to an external speaker. She is not as smart as Siri and answers basic basic questions. I deal with it because I bought the WeMo fixtures for lights and switches and she works fine with those. I would recommend the echo dot if you would like to make her louder or like music loud
My daughter loves it. Much faster than her last tablet.
It is fun and cute, but I wish that it would do more.
I previously own a kindle paperwhite version one then upgraded to kindle voyage.big difference. Worth the price!
Best
The tablet offered my son hours and hours of continuous learning and excitement he would not put it down until it went dead and the batteries had to be recharged
I love my Echo. Great for music. Great sound and I can listen to any genre of music I like. Does so many things. Incredible!
GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation
Alexa is an amazing device. Does more than we thought could do. could not be happier.
I'm so glad I purchased this! I did have the older version with the smaller screen and what a difference it makes having the larger screen! It's volume & clarity are great, it's light and easy to use. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is on the fence and thinking about purchasing it.
I love my amazon fire. This is the best product I've ever bought. I can get any books I want for way cheaper than they are on store.
I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money.
Fire box was a perfect up grade to my TV entertainment system. The ability to show 4k movies made it perfect. My daughter gets to see her cartoons and I get to see my action movies perfectly. You can use Ethernet and dual band wifi. Its so much in a small box with a low price. ITS PERFECT!
Great speaker, able to move around, connect to iPad when watching movies. Love it!
The Amazon tablet series has come along way since it first came out. The screen on the Fire HD 10 is stunning. Clear and easy to read. If used to android apps though, may be disappointed that some of your favorite apps will not be available on this tablet.
bought this tablet for a first time user the price was right the quality was good
It is a good tablet for $50. I like the ability to create adult and child profiles.
I bought this as a gift for my mother. It is very easy to set up and use. She doesn't need a lot of space or use many apps so this is great for her to use without having to go to her laptop.
It's a decent tablet for the price, especially if you have Amazon Prime. The ads are really annoying though and you have to pay to turn them off or pay extra for a tablet that comes without ads.
My son just loves it and he thinks it's easy to use and the case that comes on it has saved it
Beach necessity for avid reader! It is a must have if you want to read in direct sunlight!
Easy to set up and use. I bought this for my five year old son.
The Echo and Amazon Prime make for the perfect combo. Using this for parent in a rehab facility who can't see very well after a stroke. The voice commands work great only challenge is the connection to the facilities wifi. At home it would be no problem at all.
I purchased this table for my son to check email, watch movies and play games. He loves it!
I love my kindle, i did a lot of research and this was the best option for me, i don't regret buying it.
At first wasn't so sure about getting the Echo. Finally after reading reviews and the things it could do I bought one. So far it has worked great and looking forward to being able to continue to expand its capabilities and help smart wire my house.
Great product compact easy to use fits right into the back of your TV. has a video tutorial that makes set up an installation very simple works great. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a streaming device at a reasonable cost
Amazon Fire TV is worth the cost for me , I watch a lot of shows.The game controller and games, not so much. They remind me of the old style joy stick games...sorry I bought that part., its hard to use.
There are others streaming devices but they seem to lacking storage or memory
Easy to scroll through the menu t watch what you want.just less the price of others
Awesome device, no cable for...one in every room, plug and play
This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends.
Ok overall but brakes easily with obly one fall to the floor
It's pretty fun to play around with this device by Amazon. The voice recognition is incredible. Test it a little so you can learn it's potential and limitations. Had it for several weeks now and still plenty satisfied.
This is my first Android tablet. I have used numerous Apple iPad's though.The only thing I have been dissatisfied with is that there isn't an Instagram app available but that doesn't have anything to do with Amazon or Kindle.
Tablet is great for 7 inches. Touch screen works great
Great tablet for the price. I already have 3 followers including the hd.
Wondering why I spent $150 for the Echo when I could have purchased the Dot for $40 and does everything the Echo does...and more! With the Dot you can stream music to Bluetooth speakers, which can't be done with the Echo.
I brought this item for my grandson and I know that he will really enjoy it and it was a great price.
Love this ereader; very convenient. Very easy to use.
Love the Alexa. She doesn't know as much as Google, but she is still great. I rely on her a lot. Worth every penny.
My son wanted this on Black Friday and it was the best purchase! I love that there is a kid mode just for him. I wish I had bought one for myself!
